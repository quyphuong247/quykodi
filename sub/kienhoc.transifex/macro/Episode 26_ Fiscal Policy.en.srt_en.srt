I have a quick review question for you: which
economists believe that the economy is not

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:11,850
self-regulating, Classical or Keynesian? Keynesian
economists believe the economy will not self-adjust.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,929
Remember that this model arose from the evidence
of the Great Depression, when the global economy

4
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,660
was in decline for an extended period. Because
Keynesians do not believe that economic problems

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,039
are going to take care of themselves, they
conclude that the government should play a

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,680
very active role in the economy. What kind
of role? There are actually different tools

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,790
that can be used to manage the economy, but
let's start with fiscal policy.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,920
First of all, what is fiscal policy? By definition,
fiscal policy is changes in government expenditures

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,200
and taxation to achieve particular macroeconomic
goals; that is, to achieve stable prices,

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,110
low unemployment, and high &amp; sustained growth.
In a country like the United States, who is

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,559
it the controls government spending and taxation?
It's going to be our legislative and executive

12
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,780
branches. Fiscal policy can be used to stimulate
a sluggish economy, or to slow down an economy

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,789
that's moving too fast.

14
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:10,990
Expansionary fiscal policy is typically represented
by stimulus to the aggregate demand (although

15
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,369
it certainly is possible to stimulate aggregate
supply). Aggregate demand can be increased

16
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:21,909
by either increasing government spending,
or decreasing taxes. Since aggregate demand

17
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,929
is composed of consumption, investment, government
spending, and net exports, an increase in

18
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:33,329
government spending has a direct, immediate
effect on aggregate demand; a tax cut, which

19
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,038
will encourage spending on the part of households
and businesses, has an indirect effect on

20
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,090
aggregate demand as consumption and investment
rise.

21
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,880
Contractionary fiscal policy is typically
represented by some type of drag on the aggregate

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,039
demand -- either decreasing government spending,
or increasing taxes. Again, a change in government

23
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:56,969
spending will have a direct effect on aggregate
demand, whereas a change in taxes will indirectly

24
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,829
affect aggregate demand, by way of households
and businesses.

25
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:06,309
TIME TO THINK: If you were a politician, which
type of policy, expansionary or contractionary,

26
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:12,069
would you like better? Well, if I were a politician,
and my primary objective was to get re-elected

27
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:17,040
to office, I’d want the policy that's more
popular with the voters. After all, what will

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,900
the voters like better: tax cuts, and more
spending on their favorite programs (that

29
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,010
is, expansionary policy), or higher taxes
and cuts to their favorite programs (contractionary

30
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,760
policy)? Well, as a politician, I would prefer
expansionary policy, because voters prefer

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,640
expansionary policy. The problem, though,
is the effect that such a policy has on the

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,089
nation's deficit and, in turn, its debt. The
deficit is how much overspending there is

33
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,530
in a single year; the debt is the accumulation
of all the deficits we've ever run. Expansionary

34
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,799
fiscal policy -- lower taxes and/or higher
government spending – adds to our deficit

35
00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:00,269
and in turn, our debt. When we get to taxes
and budget in Episode 28, we’ll look at

36
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,409
interest payments on the debt. Yes, for the
government to engage in deficit spending,

37
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,040
it must borrow -- just like you do when you
spend more money than you have -- and then

38
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,459
it has to pay back the loan with interest.
And we’ll look at the subsequent drag on

39
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,900
the economy.

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,790
So -- expansionary fiscal policy (lower taxes
and/or higher spending) will increase aggregate

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:25,780
demand; contractionary policy (higher taxes
and/or lower government spending) will decrease

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,230
aggregate demand. If fiscal policy is meant
to address the three macroeconomic goals,

43
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,040
when is each type of policy appropriate?

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,900
Well, if it is a recessionary gap, where the
equilibrium GDP is lower than our potential

45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,049
(which also means that unemployment is higher
than the natural rate), expansionary policy

46
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:49,359
would be the appropriate response. As aggregate
demand increases, the economy moves to full

47
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,989
employment and potential GDP.

48
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,180
If there's an inflationary gap, where equilibrium
GDP is higher than the full employment level,

49
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,799
and unemployment is so low that it's likely
to cause inflation, contractionary policy

50
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,859
would be appropriate response. As aggregate
demand falls, the economy slows, bringing

51
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,999
us back to potential output -- the full employment
level.

52
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,650
A Classical economist would probably ask,
“Why not just wait for aggregate supply

53
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,269
to move, and allow it to correct the economy?”
If you do not believe that the economy will

54
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,720
self-adjust, or even if you think that it
may self-adjust, but only over very long time,

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,330
then you probably prefer a more active, hands-on
policy to help things along.

56
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,109
NEXT TIME: Should we use fiscal policy?
