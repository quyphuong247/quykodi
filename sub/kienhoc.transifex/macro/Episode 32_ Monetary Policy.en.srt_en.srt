The Federal Reserve has many roles, but the
single most important responsibility is to

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,790
control the nation’s money supply. Remember
that monetary policy is changes to the money

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,119
supply in order to achieve particular macroeconomic
goals; and in the US, the Fed controls monetary

4
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,020
policy and the money supply. Making more money
available, expansionary policy, makes it easier

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,289
to spend, so aggregate demand increases. Making
less money available, contractionary policy,

6
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,409
makes it more difficult to spend so aggregate
demand falls. The question now is: How does

7
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,949
the Fed control, or make changes to, the money
supply?

8
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:43,370
The Fed has three major tools to control the
money supply: 1) Open Market Operations, or

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,578
OMOs, 2) the required reserve ratio, and 3)
the discount rate. How does each of these

10
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:55,210
work, and which tool or tools does the Fed
prefer? Let's take them one at a time.

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:02,210
Open Market Operations. Just as with fiscal
policy, monetary policy can be either expansionary,

12
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:08,549
stimulating the economy, or contractionary,
slowing the economy. If open market operations

13
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,289
are the buying and selling of government securities,
which is expansionary, and which is contractionary?

14
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:19,520
Let's look at an example of an open-market
purchase where the Fed buys $1 million of

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,750
securities, or government bonds, from Wells
Fargo. The Fed sees a change in its asset

16
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,950
mix as it increases its holdings of securities,
and decreases its holdings of cash, depositing

17
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,490
$1 million into Wells Fargo's account. Wells
Fargo also sees a change in its asset mix,

18
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:43,359
with $1 million less in government securities,
but $1 million more on deposit with the Fed.

19
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,280
The big difference is that $1 million in securities
can’t be loaned out, but $1 million in bank

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,530
reserves, or at least some fraction of it,
can be lent out. With the open-market purchase,

21
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,640
the Fed has injected $1 million into the economy,
plus whatever additional effect from the lending

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,950
of the excess reserves, making this expansionary
policy.

23
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,220
What about an open-market sale? Let's say
that the Fed sells $1 million of government

24
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,250
securities to Bank One. The Fed sees a decrease
its holdings of securities, but Bank One pays

25
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,950
the Fed $1 million – actually, the Fed just
deducts the amount from Bank One's Federal

26
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,089
Reserve deposits. Bank One now has $1 million
less on deposit at the Fed -- that’s $1

27
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,860
million less in actual bank reserves -- but
has $1 million more in securities. What this

28
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,260
means is that Bank One now has less money
to lend, and less money in circulation means

29
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,140
less spending, slowing down the economy. Therefore,
an open-market sale is contractionary monetary

30
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,609
policy.

31
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,530
What about the second tool, the required reserve
ratio? We’ve seen this one action already,

32
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,980
when we examined how the banking system creates
money, but let me recap. Recall that the maximum

33
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,470
change in checkable deposits, and therefore
the money supply, is [1/r x the initial change

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,359
in reserves]. For example, if the change in
reserves is $500, and the required reserve

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,570
ratio -- that is, the percentage of total
deposits that the bank is legally required

36
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:15,570
to hold onto -- is 10%, then the maximum change
in the money supply is [(1/.1)x$500], or 10

37
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,000
(the money multiplier) x $500, or $5000.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,690
Now, what if the Fed increases the required
reserve ratio to 20% (technically, according

39
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,730
to the Monetary Control Act of 1980, the Fed
is only allowed a range from 8% to 14%, but

40
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,140
let’s just use 20% hypothetically; it makes
the math easier). What's going to be the new

41
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:44,339
maximum possible change in the money supply?
With a required reserve ratio of .2 (that's

42
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,340
20%), the multiplier is now (1/.2), or 5,
so the maximum change is [5x$500], or $2500.

43
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,179
This means that raising the reserve requirement
is contractionary monetary policy, since the

44
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,790
overall possible change is half what it was
before, slowing the economy. This makes sense,

45
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,230
since a higher reserve ratio means that banks
are legally required to hold onto more reserves,

46
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,670
leaving less to lend out.

47
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:19,669
What if the Fed decreases the reserve requirement
to 5%? Now the multiplier, [1/r], or [1/.05],

48
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:28,340
is 20. So a $500 change in reserves can make
up to a $10,000 difference in the money supply.

49
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,469
Decreasing the required reserve ratio makes
more money available for lending, thereby

50
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,380
increasing spending in the economy -- an expansionary
monetary policy

51
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,430
The third tool, the discount rate, is the
interest rate at which commercial banks can

52
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,470
borrow from the Fed. This one is pretty common
sense; at a higher interest rate, banks are

53
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,550
less inclined to borrow, which slows the economy,
or contractionary policy; at a lower interest

54
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,190
rate, banks are more inclined to borrow, putting
more money in circulation, and stimulating

55
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,650
the economy -- expansionary policy.

56
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,700
Here's the kicker, though: sometimes even
at very attractive rates, banks don't want

57
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,849
to borrow from the Fed. To borrow money, a
bank can go to other commercial banks, or

58
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,410
they can go to the Fed. Borrowing from other
banks means entering the Federal Funds Market,

59
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,560
and being subject to the federal funds rate,
the interest rate that banks charge each other.

60
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,020
Borrowing from the Fed means paying the discount
rate, or the rate at which the Fed lends to

61
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,960
member banks. Which will the borrowing bank
choose? You’d think it would be the lower

62
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,830
interest rate, wouldn’t you? Well, oddly
enough, even if the discount rate is less

63
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,840
than the federal funds rate, a bank still
may go the Federal Funds market for the loan.

64
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,590
Why?

65
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,729
Well, for a few reasons really. First, there's
the purpose of the loan. That is, the Fed

66
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:53,670
frowns on making loans for risky profit ventures.
Second, consider the Fed bureaucracy. Among

67
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:59,720
the functions of the Fed, one is to supervise
member banks. Do you want to ask your supervisory

68
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,940
entity for a loan, or multiple loans? Borrowing
too often from the Fed might look like bad

69
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,530
management, opening your bank up to an audit.
Third, there's the fact that borrowing from

70
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,940
the Fed is a privilege, not a right, for member
banks. If you abuse the privilege, you may

71
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,870
be turned down in the future. For all of these
reasons, the Fed is referred to as the lender

72
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,730
of last resort.

73
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:26,730
So which tool – OMOs, the required reserve
ratio, or the discount rate -- does the Fed

74
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:33,510
prefer to use? The Fed tends to use open-market
operations the most, for several reasons.

75
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,930
1) OMOs are flexible. The Fed can conduct
sales or purchases in any dollar amount that

76
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,020
they want. 2) OMOs are reversible. If the
Fed conducts an open-market purchase today,

77
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:51,340
it can turn right around and conduct an open-market
sale tomorrow. 3) Quick implementation. Fed

78
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,900
OMOs take place very rapidly, as transactions
occur electronically. You've seen the discount

79
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,320
rate drawback -- many banks prefer not to
borrow from the Fed unless absolutely necessary;

80
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,510
and changing the required reserve ratio is
like trying to use a sledgehammer on the economy.

81
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,449
In the end, the Fed prefers to try fine-tuning
the economy with OMOs.
