One outcome of the production possibilities
model that’s tough, yet very real-world,

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,120
is that without acquiring more resources,
in order to get more of one kind of output

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,538
(like a better economics grade), you MUST
sacrifice some of the other output (like your

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:21,130
math grade). This sacrifice is a fact of life,
folks; it’s called opportunity cost.

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,729
By definition, opportunity cost is the highest-valued
foregone alternative when any choice is made.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,950
Look -- think back to the example of the student.
What was the opportunity cost of getting a

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,730
better grade in economics? The student would
have to accept a lower grade in math, so the

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,440
sacrifice was the math grade.

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,570
The full cost of any choice is not just the
price tag. Although that direct, out-of-pocket

10
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,620
monetary cost does influence our decisions,
the full cost also includes the opportunity

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,410
cost. What gets sacrificed; that is to say,
what else could you have done with your resources?

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,140
OK, here's an example of a choice that you
have in common with the rest of the class:

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,380
you opted to go to college. What is the full
cost of that decision? Remember that the full

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,520
cost of attending college is the sum of the
direct, those out-of-pocket costs, and indirect,

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,719
or opportunity cost. Is the opportunity cost
really all that important? Can it influence

16
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,880
a decision one way or another? Well, let's
think it through, and then decide.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,789
What are the direct costs of attending college?
That is, what out-of-pocket costs will you

18
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:37,789
incur? Tuition, registration fees, books,
supplies, etcetera. Now, what are the indirect

19
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:43,920
costs of attending college? That is, what
could you have done with your time and energy,

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,539
if you weren’t in college? What is it that
gets sacrificed? Note that opportunity cost

21
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:55,999
doesn't necessarily have to have a specific
dollar price tag attached, just a value. Well,

22
00:01:55,999 --> 00:02:00,600
it might be that you could have been working.
If this is the case, you could be sacrificing

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,530
salary and/or career advancement. Possibly,
you’re giving up time that you could be

24
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,280
spending with friends or family. For myself,
one thing that was sacrificed was starting

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,690
a family --. I waited until I was finished
with grad school to have a baby. Or maybe

26
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:20,430
travel, or just leisure time. In the late
1990s, my husband worked at a dotcom, and

27
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,050
he’d tell me how every day for three weeks
the newly hired CEO would stare out the window

28
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,980
during meetings and mumble, “I could be
out playing golf right now.” Then the CEO

29
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,220
quit.

30
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,910
The decision to go to, or stay in, college
is similar. If the opportunity cost is too

31
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,230
high, the decision-maker will decide not to
attend. This often occurs with college athletes.

32
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,470
If professional teams will hire them, then
they could be sacrificing millions by staying

33
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,840
in college. As a result, top athletes often
leave college early for the pros.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,430
Going back to the original question, what
is THE opportunity cost of attending college?

35
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:04,430
Well, it depends. Remember that by definition,
the opportunity cost is the single highest-valued

36
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,420
alternative to that particular decision-maker
when any choice is made. The opportunity cost,

37
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,420
then, varies from person to person. I even
had a friend in college whose boyfriend, upon

38
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,140
dumping her, informed her that SHE was the
opportunity cost of attending college. She

39
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,989
never cared much for economics after that.

40
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:29,620
What is your opportunity cost of attending
college? Even with all the costs associated

41
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,400
with attending college, you decided to attend
anyway. Why is that?
