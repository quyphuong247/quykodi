Remember our three macroeconomic goals? There
was 1) stable prices, 2) low unemployment,

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:13,429
and 3) high and sustained growth. We're up
to the third goal, high and sustained growth.

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,870
The natural question now is, growth of what?
The answer is that we want to see growth of

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,730
the country's income -- the country's real
income -- but how we measure it?

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,710
Well, a country generates income by producing
goods and services, and selling them. There

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,800
are actually quite a few ways to look at a
country's income. But when it comes to examining

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,800
a country's growth, we look at its gross domestic
product, or GDP. GDP is the total market value

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,489
of all final goods and services produced in
a given time period, within a country's borders.

9
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:50,010
Think carefully about what this definition
does and does not include as part of the country's

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:57,010
income. If there's a US company that’s located
abroad producing products, that does not count

11
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:03,470
as part of the GDP. But if there's a foreign
company located in the US producing products,

12
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,560
that does count as part of the GDP.

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,670
What about the “final goods and services”
piece? The value of final goods and services

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,889
-- that is, those items purchased by the ultimate
consumer -- are counted in the GDP. The value

15
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:23,060
of intermediate goods, that will be used as
part of something else before getting to the

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,240
hands of the final consumer, are not counted.
Think of it this way: if you count the value

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,779
of wheat, and then the value of the flour
that's made from that wheat, and then the

18
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:36,869
value of the loaf of bread that was made from
the flour that was made from the wheat, you’ve

19
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,630
counted the value of the wheat three times!
The term “total market value” means the

20
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,048
total value at that time period -- that's
the nominal value -- of the final goods and

21
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:47,700
services.

22
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,849
Now that we know the definition of GDP, how
do we actually measure it? Do I really need

23
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:57,939
to know all of the final goods and services
being produced, and today's market price for

24
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:03,178
each, so that I can find the total value?
Thankfully, there's an easier way for us to

25
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:08,878
work with GDP: the expenditure approach. There's
also what’s referred to as the income approach,

26
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,319
but since we won't really be using that this
semester, I’ll just set it aside for now.With

27
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,859
the expenditure approach, you just think about
what happens to all goods and services that

28
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,400
we produce. Somebody has to buy all that stuff,
right? Well, who? Who buys the goods and services

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,069
that get produced?

30
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,458
The goods and services are purchased by four
sectors of the economy: 1) the household,

31
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,189
or consumer, sector. In the United States,
this represents the single largest sector,

32
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:43,189
with its spending accounting for roughly 70%
of the entire GDP. 2) the business sector.

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,149
Businesses purchase capital goods, that is,
machinery and equipment, constituting real

34
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,670
investment. 3) the government sector. The
government purchases goods and services so

35
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,760
that it can function, and provide its services.
4) the foreign sector. Foreigners purchase

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,108
a certain amount of our products and services;
we call these exports. Of course, we also

37
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,420
purchase from other countries; what we buy
from the rest of the world is our imports.

38
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,920
We’re interested in knowing, on net, what
others buy from us, so we look at the net

39
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,140
exports to the foreign sector, or exports
minus imports.

40
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,640
Altogether, GDP is the sum of the expenditures
made by the four sectors of the economy: consumption,

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,798
by the household sector; investment, by the
business sector; government spending, by the

42
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,799
government sector; and net exports, to the
foreign sector. In short, GDP equals consumption,

43
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:45,099
plus investment, plus government spending,
plus net exports, or GDP = C + I + G + X.
