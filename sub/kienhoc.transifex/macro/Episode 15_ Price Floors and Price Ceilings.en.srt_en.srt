Market driven -- i.e., supply and demand driven
-- price and quantity presume we have a free

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,210
market; that is, a market that's free of any
outside intervention, and is allowed to “do

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,769
its own thing.” Who has the power and motivation
to interfere with the market mechanism? The

4
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:23,269
government may interfere with market operations,
if it feels it is protecting society, or some

5
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:25,679
part of society, from harm.

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,880
The government will establish a price floor
-- a legal minimum price for the market – if

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,609
it feels that the market price is too low.
Thus, the price floor will be set above the

8
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:42,809
equilibrium. Who is the price floor meant
to protect? The price floor is meant to protect

9
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,030
the seller. From what? Well, a price that's
too low for sellers would be too low to cover

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,739
costs, and keep the seller business. What
kinds of businesses will be important enough

11
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,559
to warrant this kind of government help? Typically,
agriculture or food industries; the government

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,500
feels the need to support the farmers in order
to keep our domestic food supply intact. OK,

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,119
so the government imposes a price floor, Pf,
on this market. Let's say that this is the

14
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,960
market for milk in upstate New York, as was
the case some years back. What happens at

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,240
Pf? Dairy farmers are quite happy with this
price, and are willing to provide QS units

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,829
of milk. The consumers, however, aren't too
keen on this price, and are only willing to

17
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:36,829
buy Qd units of milk. The result of the price
floor? A surplus of milk in the market. No

18
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,658
problem, right? Surpluses are easy enough
to fix; the price drops and… oops. The price

19
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,570
cannot adjust downward to get rid of the surplus.
Now what? Well, maybe the government could

20
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,270
buy up all the surplus, but then what do they
do with it? I don’t know -- maybe give it

21
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:02,270
to schools? The troops? The homeless? Foreign
countries? Any of these uses would require

22
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,080
a pretty extensive (and expensive) distribution
network and bureaucracy paid for by -- you

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,440
guessed it -- the taxpayers! So, now we're
paying high prices for milk, AND paying to

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,950
buy and distribute the excess? Well, what
if the government decides it’s not such

25
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,790
a great idea, and refuses to buy the surplus?
“Hey, you farmers, we’re already keeping

26
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,450
the price of the milk propped up – deal
with your own surplus!” Now what happens?

27
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,760
No one wants the milk at the high prices,
and it isn’t legal to sell it below Pf.

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,659
In upstate New York, a lot of farms have creeks
running through the property, and farmers

29
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:43,379
dumped their surplus milk out back -- into
the creek, and on into the Susquehanna and

30
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,030
Chenango rivers.

31
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,760
Question: rather than impose an artificial
price on the market, resulting in all manner

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,980
of other problems, is there any way to, well,
manage the market to get the equilibrium price

33
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,690
up to Pf , where we want it to be? Well, sure
-- we could alter the underlying market conditions,

34
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,950
the demand and supply. How do you push price
upward by using demand? You increase the demand

35
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,268
for milk, maybe by using celebrities in a
nationwide “Got milk?” campaign, or by

36
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,760
citing research that says milk helps you lose
weight. On the supply side, if the milk supply

37
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,909
could be reduced, price would rise; this is
often why you hear about the government paying

38
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:28,470
farmers NOT to produce their product.

39
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,939
What about the other side? Price ceilings
are established when the government feels

40
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:41,489
that the market equilibrium price is too high.
Too high for whom? For buyers. Price ceilings

41
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,159
are meant to protect buyers from high prices.
Not for all products, mind you; price ceilings

42
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,859
are more likely to be applied to products
that everyone needs, that are perceived as

43
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,860
being necessary, and necessarily affordable,
to all income groups. Housing, like rent controls,

44
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,459
and energy are typical candidates for price
ceilings.

45
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,260
Consider gasoline. Just after 9/11, both state
and federal proposals were made to cap the

46
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,798
price of gasoline at $2.50 a gallon, to prevent
price gouging at the pump. Sounds like a pretty

47
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,920
good deal, compared to three or four dollar
gas, doesn't it? But consider the implications

48
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,920
-- the proposed price ceiling, PC, was to
be at $2.50 a gallon, but the actual market

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
equilibrium price is, say, $4 a gallon. At
price PC, the price ceiling, consumers are

50
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,530
very happy. They want to buy Qd gallons of
gas. Gas station owners, however, are only

51
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:46,530
willing to provide Qs gallons of gas at this
price. This means that not everyone is going

52
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,360
to get the gasoline that they want, because
there is a shortage. Well that’s OK, right?

53
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,650
As a result of the shortage, prices will rise
and… wait! Prices can’t rise! So what

54
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:04,650
happens? Rationing? Black markets for gasoline?
Long lines at the pump? Think about this:

55
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,850
Would you rather KNOW that you can get gas
as long as you're willing to pay $4 a gallon,

56
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,200
or HOPE that you can get gas at the price
ceiling of $2.50?

57
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,349
Is there a way to make $2.50 the equilibrium
price, instead of imposing it on the market

58
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,570
as an artificial price, and creating a shortage
that leads to other problems? Yes. If we could,

59
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,130
say, decrease the demand for gas -- say, more
public transit, better fuel mileage on cars,

60
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:40,380
more conservation – and/or increase the
supply of gas -- maybe open the national strategic

61
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,320
reserves or drill of the Alaskan Wildlife
Refuge, etcetera -- then you would push the

62
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,340
price closer to where we wanted to be.

63
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,380
