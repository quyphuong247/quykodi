Now, I don't want to give anyone the false
impression that tariffs are out of control;

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,360
in fact, on average, tariffs on traded goods
are lower than they were at any point in the

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,459
20th century. Let me give you a little background
first: in the 1920s, when Herbert Hoover was

4
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:19,050
running for office, he made a campaign promise
to US farmers to protect them from foreign

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,230
competition if he was elected to office. Once
he was elected, he needed legislative support

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,189
to get a bill moving through Congress. Getting
started wasn't so bad; legislators from farming

7
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,380
states were more than happy to sponsor such
a bill -- but that wasn't enough votes to

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,329
actually get it passed. So what you do if
you're seeking support for a farming protection

9
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:42,020
bill from people who care nothing about farming?
What if, for example, you're approaching a

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,780
representative from Detroit? How do you make
the proposed bill more interesting? Add a

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,090
line or two about protecting the automakers,
perhaps? And so it went: a little something

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,180
for car makers, furniture producers, textile
manufacturers… in the end, the Smoot-Hawley

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,840
Bill entailed protection for over 20,000 US
products.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,500
Now, other countries in the world weren’t
sitting idly by while Smoot-Hawley was making

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,940
its rounds; they were, to say the least, rather
unhappy at the prospect of restrictions on

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,110
so many of their own products. In an attempt
to stop the US, other countries threatened

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,150
to impose restrictions of their own if Smoot-Hawley
passed. Some countries, like Canada, wrote

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,270
their own protectionist legislation, while
others simply said that they would boycott

19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,929
US products. Nonetheless, in 1929 the Smoot-Hawley
Bill became law -- the first shot in global

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,160
trade war. Between 1929 and 1932, the total
volume of world trade fell from a total value

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,929
of about $3 billion to only $1 billion, making
Smoot-Hawley one of the major contributing

22
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,450
factors to the Great Depression.

23
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,830
Europe was soon embroiled in World War II,
with the US to follow. After the war, countries

24
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,679
around the world agreed that perhaps the trade
brawl had been a mistake that ought not to

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,100
be repeated, and many of them sat down and
formed an agreement, to begin scaling back

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,910
the tariff restrictions. This was the birth
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,

27
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:07,450
or GATT. At their highest, around 1930, the
average level of tariffs on traded goods was

28
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,930
at about 70%, nearly doubling the prices on
imported goods. With the first full round

29
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:19,180
of GATT in 1947, tariffs were reduced to about
40%, and then reduced further with each subsequent

30
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,380
round. By 1993, GATT was in its ninth round,
the Uruguay Round, and tariffs were down to

31
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,930
about 2 to 3% average on traded goods.

32
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,000
Here's the thing, though: just because governments
have agreed to cut tariffs, does this mean

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,110
that the weak domestic industries stop wanting
protection? No! So if you sign an agreement

34
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,610
that says your country won’t use tariffs,
does this necessarily mean that no protection

35
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,430
will be used? No; in fact, with the decline
in tariffs came an increase in quotas. So

36
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,050
then GATT began to address quotas. With the
decline in quotas came increase in the use

37
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,730
of voluntary export restraints (VERs), or
other nontariff barriers (NTBs), like health

38
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,450
and safety restrictions.

39
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,869
Take a look at the duration of each round.
Do you notice that each round gets longer

40
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,680
and longer? That's because 1) it gets harder
and harder to ”trim the fat,” 2) the most

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,560
contentious products -- usually agriculture
-- kept getting put on the back burner, and

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,500
3) the Uruguay Round was the first to try
to deal with the trade restrictions placed

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,480
on services. Back when GATT started, it was
dealing only with hard goods, like cars and

44
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,329
refrigerators; trade in financial services,
technical consulting, and the like, didn't

45
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,550
appear until later. It took the better part
of nine years to complete the Uruguay Round,

46
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,440
and when it was done, not only were there
reductions in protection, but also the old

47
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,760
GATT was gone. It evolved into the World Trade
Organization, or WTO. The WTO is meant to

48
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,000
serve as a place for trade dispute mediation.
If one country has a complaint about another

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,470
country’s trade policies, that complaint
can be heard by the WTO.

50
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,900
Here's an interesting tidbit from The Economist
magazine: as of 2009, the US was the single

51
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,140
most challenged country, i.e. the country
that has had the most complaints lodged against

52
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,399
it for unfair trade policies. However, we
are also the single largest complaining nation.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,030
The US has lodged more complaints against
other countries than any other single nation.

54
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,780
Keep these facts in mind for WTO discussion
that we’ll be having in our next face-to-face

55
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,138
class.
