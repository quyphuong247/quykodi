You may recall from the previous episode on
the World Trade Organization, formerly known

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,570
as GATT, that the process of coming to agreement
with over 150 countries involved is a long

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,720
and arduous journey, with every round taking
longer and longer to complete. Given that,

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,869
some countries are finding it more expedient
to work in smaller groups, usually with neighbors,

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:27,130
to eliminate trade barriers. But even in smaller
groups, there's a spectrum of types of trade

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,168
blocs. A trade bloc is a group of countries
which trade with one another, but they have

7
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:36,800
an agreement among members to reduce trade
barriers with one another. The differences

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,860
among the types of trade blocs come from both
internal rules (that is, rules among the member

9
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:48,140
countries) and external rules, or dealings
with nonmembers. Let me show you.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,739
The lowest level of commitment to trade barrier
reduction is a preferential trade area, where

11
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,640
members lower, but do not eliminate, barriers
among themselves. Dealings with nonmembers

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,950
are not addressed, so member countries maintain
policies of their own choosing with regard

13
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,020
to nonmember countries.

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,580
The next level of commitment is a free trade
area, where member countries agree to eliminate

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,390
trade barriers among themselves, but continue
to maintain independent policies in their

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,530
dealings with nonmember countries. An example
of a free trade area is NAFTA, the North American

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,159
Free Trade Agreement, where Canada, Mexico
and the US have agreed to eliminate the barriers

18
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,540
among themselves, but each maintains independent
policy when trading with other areas of the

19
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,640
world.

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,150
The third type of trade bloc is a customs
union, where member countries not only eliminate

21
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,350
internal trade barriers, but they also adopt
common policies for trade barriers on any

22
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:53,199
nonmembers. For example Russia, Kazakhstan
and Belarus formed a customs union in 2010.

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,900
Those countries are eliminating trade barriers
among themselves, but would agree to some

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,540
common set of trade standards on anyone who
is not in their group.

25
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,810
After the customs union, trade blocs begin
to address the flow not only of goods and

26
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,780
services, but also the flow of resources,
like labor. In a common market, members eliminate

27
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,790
internal trade barriers, adopt common external
trade barriers, AND allow free movement of

28
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,170
resources among the member countries. Think
about the US: if you lived in New York, and

29
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,769
wanted to leave New York for a job in California,
there are no barriers to prevent you from

30
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:36,420
making that choice. Examples of common markets
include Mercosur -- also known as the Southern

31
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,260
Cone Market â€“ whose members include Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela's

32
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,739
membership pending, at the moment. Other markets
would be the East African Common Market or

33
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,520
the West African Common Market.

34
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,530
After the common market is economic union:
members eliminate internal barriers, adopt

35
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,590
common external barriers, allow free movement
of resources among members, AND adopt a uniform

36
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,910
set of economic policies. The European Union,
once the common currency had been adopted,

37
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,970
became a prime example of an economic union.
With one currency, they had to adopt one monetary

38
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,580
policy.

39
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,629
At the final structure in the spectrum, there's
full integration of the member states, like

40
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,849
the United States.

41
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:28,060
NEXT TIME: Well, we've reached the end of
the road where my original plan for this series

42
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,209
is concerned, so now I think it's going to
be up to you. I'm getting a lot of feedback

43
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,590
from YouTube viewers so you never know -- I
might be working on one of your ideas.
