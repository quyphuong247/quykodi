Now that we know what fiscal policy is -- changes
in government spending and taxation to achieve

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,960
particular macroeconomic goals -- should we
use it? As usual, the answer is “it depends.”

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,859
Perhaps the first question to ask is: can
or will the economy correct itself? If you

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:23,050
believe that the economy will self-adjust,
you would say “no” to active fiscal policy.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,710
Well, what if you don't think the economy
will self-adjust; then should we use fiscal

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,759
policy? Again, it depends.

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,309
First, will there be crowding out? By definition,
crowding out is the decrease in private expenditures

8
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,440
that occurs as a consequence of increased
government spending, or the financing needs

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,640
of the deficit. What this means is that, in
some cases, the government uses fiscal policy,

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,090
let's say, with the intent of giving the economy
a boost -- and the policy has the unintended

11
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,149
consequence of reducing spending by the other
sectors, like household consumption and/or

12
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,760
business investment. This “crowding out”
of the household and business spending can

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,860
be direct, like building a library and having
household purchases of books decline, or like

14
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,970
providing government dollars for charter schools,
and seeing households spend less on private

15
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,370
tuition at Catholic schools; or the crowding
out can be the indirect result of the expansionary

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:24,460
policy. If the government increases spending
and/or decreases taxes it will increase its

17
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,899
own deficit. Then the government needs to
borrow in order to pay for the overspending.

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,080
This added demand pressure for credit drives
up the price of credit, or interest rates.

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,890
As interest rates rise, consumption and investment
spending fall. The amount of crowding out

20
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,140
that occurs, if any, will depend on the type
of fiscal stimulus used, since not all types

21
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,830
of government spending could replace household
and business spending. TIME TO THINK: Can

22
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,960
you come up with anything that the government
spends money on that would not be related

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,949
to -- i.e., not able to replace -- private
spending?

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,490
It is possible to see complete crowding out,
in which case the government spending is completely

25
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,478
offset by reductions in household and investment
spending. If this is the case, then the end,

26
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,569
there's no net increase in spending. You might
see incomplete crowding out, where the increase

27
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:19,450
in government spending is partially offset
by reductions in household investment spending.

28
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,459
If this occurs, there’s some net increase
in spending, although not as much as the government

29
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:30,000
had intended. The third possibility is that
there's no crowding out, i.e., the expansionary

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,260
fiscal policy will be fully effective. If
this is the case, that is, if you do not think

31
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,828
that the economy will correct itself, AND
fiscal policy will be fully effective in changing

32
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:45,849
aggregate demand, then should we use it? It
depends! There's still one more pitfall to

33
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,790
deal with -- the question of the timing of
the policy.

34
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,858
Consider the following: Suppose there's a
downturn in the economy. First, how do I know

35
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:59,719
there's been a downturn? Remember, a recession
is defined as two consecutive quarters of

36
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:06,249
declining real GDP. This means that somebody
out there is gathering real GDP data for you.

37
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:11,819
If the actual downturn started say, in January,
it may take a few months actually see the

38
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,030
trend in the data and realize what's happening,
particularly if the data is collected quarterly.

39
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,730
This is called the data lag, or the observation
lag.

40
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,879
Second, so your economic analyst comes to
you and tells you that real GDP has been declining

41
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:31,189
for the last month or two; what do you do?
Is it going to turn into a recession? Is it

42
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:36,269
just the “January effect,” due to post-holiday
declines in spending? If you decide to hold

43
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,760
out for the next set of data so you can tell
if it's really a downward trend, then there's

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,268
now a wait-and-see lag.

45
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:48,400
Third: So you wait and see, and after the
next set of data, realize there is indeed

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,969
a downturn in the economy. Now the question
is: what to do about it? In a society like

47
00:03:53,969 --> 00:04:00,230
ours, the decision must come from our policymakers.
So there's a legislative lag as Congress tries

48
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,310
to come up with a solution.

49
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,099
Fourth: After months of wrangling, the Congress
agrees on a plan of action -- expansionary

50
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:12,619
fiscal policy, perhaps in the form of increased
government spending on new schools. Of course,

51
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,180
this requires getting bids for designs and
construction, among other things; the transmission

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,310
lag is the time it takes to actually put the
plan into action.

53
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,810
Fifth: Once construction commences, how long
before the money actually makes its way into

54
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,320
the economy, and has an effect on aggregate
demand? The time it takes for the plan to

55
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,070
affect the economy, once it's been implemented,
is the effectiveness lag.

56
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,670
To see the potential problem inherent in these
delays, think back to the business cycle.

57
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,220
If the initial downturn is in January, 1)
we may not notice the decline until quarterly

58
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,720
GDP data is released. 2) Because a downturn
isn’t a recession until real GDP declines

59
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,380
for two consecutive quarters, we may choose
to wait in order to see if the problem is

60
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,840
trend, or if it will self-correct. 3) Once
we’ve determined there really is a problem,

61
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,109
the legislature has to come up with and approve
a plan of action. 4) Once the plan is approved,

62
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,940
it has to be implemented. And once it's implemented,
it may be a while before the stimulus takes

63
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,540
effect.

64
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,190
In this business cycle diagram, you can see
the while expansionary policy is fully effective

65
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,570
at increasing GDP, given the lags, we end
up stimulating an economy that's already expanding,

66
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,990
which causes a whole new set of problems – primarily,
inflation.

67
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,190
TIME TO THINK: for our next class, I want
you to bring your ideas as to how we could

68
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,690
minimize each of these time lags, thereby
compressing the total time, from the emergence

69
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,020
of the problem to the impact of the solution
on the economy.
