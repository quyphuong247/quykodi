If you're an economist who believes in an
active role for the government in managing

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,840
the economy, then you know that fiscal policy
-- changes in government spending and/or taxation

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,440
to achieve particular macroeconomic goals
-- is one type of tool that you can use. But

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,520
did you know that you can stimulate or slow
spending by increasing or decreasing the amount

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,590
of money that's available? By definition,
monetary policy is changes to the money supply

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,810
in order to achieve particular macroeconomic
goals. Unlike fiscal policy, which in the

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,769
case of the US, is jointly driven by Congress
and the president, monetary policy in the

8
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:40,199
US is controlled by our central bank, the
Federal Reserve. But more about the Fed in

9
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:44,629
Episode 31. For right now, if we’re talking
about the changing money supply, the first

10
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:51,629
questions I have are: 1) what exactly is money,
and 2) what exactly is the money supply?

11
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:56,850
By definition, money is any good that is widely
accepted for the purposes of exchange, and

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,760
in the repayment of debts. Over the years,
many items have been used as money -- coins

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,969
and paper, yes, but also shells, furs, cigarettes…
as long as the item is widely accepted for

14
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:13,119
the purposes of exchange, and in the repayment
of debts, that item serves as money.

15
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,740
To serve well as money, though, there are
three basic functions of money that must be

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,919
fulfilled: 1) money serves as a medium of
exchange. Without money we would have to barter

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,899
or trade, and transactions become much more
difficult. Oh, barter works fine when there's

18
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:32,950
a double coincidence of wants -- you have
something I want, and I have something you

19
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:39,460
want -- but if we don't, transactions become
much more complex. OK, here's an example:

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,089
You want to learn economics, and I can provide
that service for you. I want someone to babysit,

21
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,069
and that’s a service you can provide for
me. But what if a student wants to learn economics

22
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:55,439
from me, and offers me golf lessons in return?
I have no interest in golf, so that student

23
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,508
will have to find someone else to trade with,
then come back and trade with me. If only

24
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,840
we had money, something we would all accept
for exchanges -- how much easier this transaction

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
would be!

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,080
2) The second function money needs to serve
is as a unit of account, i.e. money gives

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,409
us a common measurement in which values are
expressed. For example, what there is no money

28
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:23,489
and you want to learn economics at this college.
There are multiple instructors; what if one

29
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:29,140
wants to be paid in babysitting, another in
computer help, and another pet sitting, and

30
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,920
so on? It becomes very difficult to tell who
has the best price. But if every instructor

31
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,129
charges in the same item, the accepted money,
it becomes very clear who has the lowest price.

32
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:46,890
3) The third function that money needs to
serve is as a store of value, that is, money

33
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,629
maintains its value over time. This enables
saving, lending, and borrowing.

34
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:58,280
Do we need to have money? No; an economy could
function without money, but transactions would

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,519
be much more cumbersome. Money helps the economy
move along more smoothly, reducing transactions

36
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,629
costs.

37
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:10,500
Now that we know something about money, what
is the definition the money supply, i.e.,

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,439
what's included in the money supply? Well,
there are actually multiple official versions

39
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,328
of the money supply; let’s start the narrowest
definition, M1. M1 includes the components

40
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,500
of money that are most easily and immediately
converted to goods and services, or the most

41
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,870
liquid assets -- currency held outside banks,
checkable deposits, and travelers checks.

42
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,250
The M2 money supply is actually the most common
definition; it includes everything in M1,

43
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,219
plus assets that are slightly more difficult
to convert to goods and services, like small

44
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:48,109
denomination time deposits (that is, CDs),
where you'll pay a penalty for cashing in

45
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,170
early, or savings deposits, money market accounts,
etcetera.

46
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:59,170
M3, then, includes everything M2, plus longer-term
CDs and financial agreements; that is, M3

47
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,280
contains elements that are more difficult
yet to convert to goods and services.

48
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,030
Understanding what's included in the money
supply is important in understanding how the

49
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,359
money supply can actually be controlled, and
changed, in order to manipulate the economy.
