Okay, so let's say that you are a domestic
producer who is losing out to foreign competitors

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:12,059
because you have the comparative disadvantage
in production relative to that foreign producer.

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,700
You've gone to the government to ask for help
in the form of trade restrictions, but what

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,189
type of restriction will be put into place?
Let me walk you through the various tools

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,850
that could be used, and how each would affect
not only the market, but the players in that

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,590
market.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,090
Let’s start with the tariff. A tariff, by
definition, is a tax on traded goods. Technically,

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,699
this could mean a tax on imports (which we'll
be examining more detail), or on exports -- but

9
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:44,289
in the US, we tend to think of tariffs only
in terms of the taxes on imported goods, intended

10
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:49,980
to make the foreign imports less attractive
to US consumers. In fact, export taxes are

11
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,729
unconstitutional in the United States. Think
about it: what was one of the major gripes

12
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,679
of the colonists under British rule? Taxation
without representation, right? Like the Boston

13
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,350
Tea Party, where colonists who objected England
taxing their exports, dressed as natives and

14
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,869
dumped a shipment of tea into Boston Harbor.
Anyway, when discussing tariffs, let's stick

15
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,790
to analysis of taxes on imported goods. The
tax on imported goods makes those goods more

16
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,680
expensive, and consumers purchase domestic
goods instead. Are there any other effects

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,990
of such tax? When examining the effects of
any policy, I like to ask the question, “Who

18
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,039
wins, and who loses as a result of this policy?”
But in order to do that, I’d like to imagine

19
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:34,250
for a moment what the domestic economy would
look like with no trade.

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,009
Let's say that we're looking at the domestic
market for steel, with no trade. We've got

21
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:44,820
the domestic demand for steel, the domestic
supply of steel, and the resulting equilibrium

22
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,189
price and quantity in the steel market. Now,
suppose we open up this market to foreign

23
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:56,919
competition. Who will win as a result of free
trade, and who will lose? Since we’re discussing

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,030
protectionist policy in this video, I'm going
to assume that the domestic steel producers

25
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,210
are at a productive disadvantage vis-à-vis
their foreign counterparts; i.e., the foreign

26
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:13,129
producers can sell their steel at lower price,
PF, than the domestic no-trade equilibrium

27
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:19,399
price, P*. To compete, domestic producers
will have to offer this price as well. But

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,819
what is the quantity supplied at this new,
lower price? For our domestic producers, it's

29
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:31,339
pretty low. But how many domestic consumers
will want to purchase at this price? A lot.

30
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,250
And how do we make up the gap between the
large amount our consumers want to buy at

31
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,370
PF and the small amount that our producers
are willing to provide at this price? We’ll

32
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,819
need to fill the gap with imports, or steel
purchased from foreign producers. So compared

33
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,810
to a situation of no trade at all, who wins
(and who loses) with free trade? On the winning

34
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,250
side, we have our domestic consumers, who
can now purchase lots of steel, at lower prices

35
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,950
than before, and clearly foreign producers
benefit, because they’ve now expanded their

36
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:08,920
sales into our market. On the losing side,
we clearly have the domestic steel producer,

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,609
who sells much less product than before, at
a much lower price, and therefore also workers

38
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,439
in the steel industry, where wages and jobs
will be declining.

39
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,670
So this producer, facing losses under free
trade, goes to the government and lobbies

40
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,619
for assistance in the form of a tariff (T)
on incoming goods, so that the price of the

41
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,620
imported steel will actually be PF plus this
new tariff, T. Now this tariff won't be so

42
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,209
high as to close off trade altogether -- much
as our producers might like that -- but the

43
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,519
tariff-inclusive price will end up somewhere
between the free trade price, PF, and the

44
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,519
no trade price P*. So going from a situation
of free trade to a situation of restricted

45
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,560
trade, who wins and who loses? Compared to
free trade, there will be a larger quantity

46
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,060
supplied in the domestic market at this higher
price, also meaning more jobs and better salary,

47
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,129
so domestic industry wins as a result of the
tariff. You could also say the government

48
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:14,989
wins, because it gets the tax revenue on any
imports that come in, or the tariff “T”

49
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,399
times that gap, [quantity demanded minus quantity
supplied] -- whatever's being imported into

50
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,630
the country. Who loses? Well, any domestic
consumers are now facing higher prices, and

51
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,870
as a result, have a decreased quantity demanded.
At the higher price, notice the gap between

52
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,419
the domestic quantity demanded and the domestic
quantity supplied is smaller than it was under

53
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:44,180
free trade, meaning that imports are declining,
so the foreign producer loses out.

54
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,100
The second type of trade restriction is a
quota. Where the tariff was something of an

55
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,289
indirect restriction, giving domestic consumers
the incentive to buy the domestic product

56
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:57,460
rather than the foreign product, the quota
is a very direct restriction, putting limits

57
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,810
on how much of the foreign product is allowed
into our market. This could be either a quantity

58
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,759
limit (say, only 1000 units imported), or
a value restriction (for example, allowing

59
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,120
only $1 million worth of the product to be
imported).

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,729
It looks something like this: if we start
from a position of no trade at all, we have

61
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:23,370
the domestic demand and supply. Now if we
allow free trade, we add the foreign supply

62
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,210
to our supply. This drives the price down,
leading to a situation for domestic producers

63
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,039
that you saw earlier: lower price, and diminished
sales. Now, what if the domestic producer

64
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,259
goes to the government requesting protection
in the form of a quantity quota, say, 100

65
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,440
units would be allowed into our market? Watch
what happens to supply: the total supply of

66
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,100
the product -- that is, our supply plus the
foreign product that’s being allowed in

67
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,979
-- is not as large as the total supply under
free trade. This means the price is now higher,

68
00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:00,139
so the quantity supplied by domestic producers
is larger than it would be under free trade,

69
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:06,419
while imports of foreign goods are now smaller.
Who wins? Domestic producers, domestic workers,

70
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:12,889
and possibly the government, if it earns revenue
by selling quota licenses. Who loses? Domestic

71
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,190
consumers and foreign producers. Note that
although tariffs and quotas are very different

72
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,410
tools, the end result of the restrictions
is the same. In fact, for every tariff, there

73
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,470
is a tariff-equivalent quota.

74
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,539
Due to trade agreements (which I’ll get
into in the next episode, GATT/ WTO), tariffs

75
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,659
and quotas have actually declined in use over
the years. But let me ask you this: if you're

76
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,160
a domestic industry whose livelihood is being
threatened by foreign competition, but your

77
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,819
government has signed an agreement not to
use tariffs or quotas, does that mean you

78
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:50,889
won't ask for any protection? No; it just
means that you'll try to lobby for some other

79
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,900
form of restriction. For example, when an
agreement was made to reduce the number of

80
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,960
quotas around the world, voluntary export
restraints (or VERs) became more popular.

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,960
With a VER, the foreign government “volunteers”
to restrict its own exports into our market.

82
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,239
If that sounds pretty much like you quota
to you, that's because it is just like a quota.

83
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,860
The only difference is in whose government
establishes the restriction. Why would government

84
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,860
restrict its own country's exports? Because
we ask them to. In 1992, George Bush Sr. had

85
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,030
his infamous dinner with the Japanese prime
minister. What made the news was the fact

86
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,818
that President Bush became ill at dinner;
what got lost was that the trip was actually

87
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:43,120
to get the Japanese government to agree to
stop selling so many car parts in our market.

88
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,539
They said no.

89
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:49,318
Another type of restriction that’s used
is health and safety regulations. Sometimes

90
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,180
you can clearly tell that a health and safety
regulation is -- or isn't -- about health

91
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,180
and safety. Other times, a regulation is more
of a gray area that could require international

92
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,280
intermediation. For example, in the 1980s,
the Japanese government said that only Japanese

93
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:13,280
producers could properly engineer and manufacture
skis that were safe on Japanese snow. Yeah

94
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:19,099
- that one never went into effect. In the
1990s in the US, it was found that several

95
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,919
types of Chinese-produced crayons being sold
in the US had high lead content, and the US

96
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:30,500
government refused to allow any more imports
of those crayons until they were reformulated.

97
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,679
That seems like a pretty clear health and
safety concern, because small children, who

98
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,760
are the primary users of crayons, like to
eat crayons.

99
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,720
But what about more recent concerns about
genetically modified foods, for example, sometimes

100
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,910
referred to by the media as “Frankenfoods”?
For instance, in the US people don't want

101
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:56,290
just steak, but they want a nice, BIG, juicy
steak. How you get a bigger, juicier steak?

102
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,430
By having bigger cows! And so, cattle are
injected with hormones. Now, US scientists

103
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,579
say that this beef is perfectly safe, and
that foreign countries are using concerns

104
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,530
about health and safety associated with this
product as an excuse to block trade. The foreign

105
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,380
governments say that there really hasn't been
enough time to evaluate the long-term health

106
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,260
effects, so they won't buy US beef because
it's a health and safety concern. In the end,

107
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,120
who's right? To mediate such disputes, the
World Trade Organization (formerly GATT) was

108
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,750
created -- but you'll hear more about that
in the next episode.
