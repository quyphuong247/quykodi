So why are you here this semester taking economics?
What's it all about? A lot of people have

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,910
misconceptions about economics -- that we'll
spend our time studying investments, stock

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,860
market, finance.... Uh-uh. We're studying
people, folks, and why they behave the way

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,390
they do.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:22,039
Two facts are true about everyone regardless
of gender, creed, color, or income. The first

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,669
is unlimited wants -- everyone has unlimited
wants. Take my own family for example; we

7
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:33,840
have a nice home, two dogs, cat, two cars,
a big TV, multiple computers -- and yet no

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,760
matter what we have, we’d always like to
have more. I'd like a double oven, new carpeting;

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,620
I'd like to get the house painted. And my
husband’s always dreamed of his own airplane

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,449
with a home in an airpark. My daughter? A
new handheld game, cell phone, clothes, music

11
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:56,839
-- even if we ended up getting these things
there'd always be something else. That's unlimited

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,519
wants.

13
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,679
What's the problem with having unlimited wants?
Well, everyone also has limited resources,

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,810
which means there is no possible way to satisfy
all those things we'd like to have. Maybe

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,130
you don't have enough time to do everything
you'd like, or you don't have enough money

16
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,089
to acquire those things that you would like.
One thing is certain: with unlimited wants

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,710
and limited resources, choices must be made.
And that's it, really. To put it simply, economics

18
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:31,020
studies choices. What choices will people
make about how to utilize THIS many resources,

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,880
to satisfy THIS many wants? By definition,
economics is the study of how people choose

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,240
to use their scarce resources in an attempt
to satisfy their unlimited wants.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,850
Well, what does this mean exactly? As I read
through the definition, the first unfamiliar

22
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,839
term that I see is the word “scarce.”
What is scarcity? Scarcity means that there's

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,840
not enough of something -- a product, service,
or resource -- to satisfy everyone's wants,

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,590
at a zero price. This last part is important;
it tells us that if I tried to provide the

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,440
product for free, there won't be enough to
go around. So how do I decide who gets the

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,540
product? Well, one way is to start charging
money; those who are not as serious about

27
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,540
acquiring the product will drop out, those
who are willing to pay the price tag will

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,560
get the goods and services. Not a perfect
system, mind you -- can you think of any drawbacks?

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,000
How about the fact that the wealthy get the
goods and services, while the poor go without?

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,550
As I said, not a perfect system -- but hey,
that's capitalism. Anyway, that's how you

31
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,890
recognize an economic good, or a good that
is scarce: it will have a price tag indicating

32
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,660
that people are willing to pay to get the
product. If something is non-scarce, that

33
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,359
is, there is enough to satisfy everyone's
wants even at a zero price, than there'd be

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,690
no reason to charge for it. Such a commodity
would be known as a free good. Can you think

35
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:06,690
of any free goods? Breathable air, maybe?
But even this may become scarce at some point.

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,450
OK, so economics is the study of how people
choose to use THIS many resources in an attempt

37
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,450
to satisfy THIS many wants. Well, how do people
choose? People make choices that they believe

38
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,670
are in their own interest -- rational self-interest.
They look at the pros and cons (economists

39
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,149
refer to benefits and costs) and decide whether,
on net, a choice is good for them.

40
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,980
Think about this: You're out for a walk and
you find a wallet. You look inside for ID

41
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,450
and find that there's $1000. What could you
decide to do? What are your possible choices?

42
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,790
Well, there are a lot of them: you could return
the wallet and the money to the owner; you

43
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,530
could return the wallet without the money
to the owner; you could keep the money and

44
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,900
leave the wallet where you found it; or you
could just leave the whole thing... There

45
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,900
really are a lot of choices that you could
make, but which choice is the rational choice?

46
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:11,190
Well the rational choice depends on the individual
decision-maker. All choices are going to be

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,810
rational to the person that makes them. Whether
you think it's right or wrong doesn't mean

48
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,100
that it wasn't rational for someone else;
it just means that they had a different set

49
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,620
of parameters that they based their decision
on. Here's a challenge for you: Can you come

50
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,690
up with any example of a decision that's not
rationally self-interested?
