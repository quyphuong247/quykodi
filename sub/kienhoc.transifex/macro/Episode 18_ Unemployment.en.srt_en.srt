Remember that there are three Macroeconomic
goals that we want to keep an eye on: 1) stable

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,940
prices, 2) low unemployment, and 3) high and
sustained growth. We've already addressed

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,380
Goal #1) stable prices; what about Goal #2),
low unemployment?

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,150
Before I can think about what low unemployment
means, I have to understand what unemployment

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:28,299
itself means. What does it mean to be unemployed?
The first response that I get from most people

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,190
when I ask this question is: you’re unemployed
if you don’t have a job. This is not entirely

7
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,140
accurate, but I’ll need to back up several
steps to show you why.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,510
First of all, in any country – let’s use
the US as an example -- how big is the labor

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,730
force? Initially, you might think that our
labor force encompasses our entire population,

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,050
but that's not really true, is it? In the
US aren't there people who aren’t allowed

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,250
to work? Look at my family: two of the three
people living in my household have a job;

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,630
one does not. Is that third person unemployed?
No, because she's under the age of 16, and

13
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,609
child labor laws largely exclude those under
16 years of age from the labor force.

14
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:13,568
Well, does that mean that everyone age 16
and over is part of labor force? No, because

15
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:18,950
those who are institutionalized are not the
labor force, and those serving in military

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,630
are not counted in the labor force. Are these
people providing a service? Well, certainly.

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,780
Is it a service that we sell, therefore generating
additional national income, like other goods

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,359
and services that we produce? No.

19
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,929
Okay, so surely everyone who is 16 or over,
not in the military, and not institutionalized

20
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:41,479
is considered part of the labor force, right?
No, because now we get to those who choose

21
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,700
not to be in the labor force. Retirees, stay-at-home
parents, full-time students who can afford

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,099
not to work… So in the end, our labor force
is that part of our population who are over

23
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:58,789
16, not in the military, not institutionalized,
and have NOT chosen to opt out of the workforce.

24
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:04,479
Now the labor force has two components: people
who are working, and people without jobs who

25
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,090
are looking for work. This latter category
is the unemployed. Those who are unemployed

26
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,420
are not working, but are seeking work.

27
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,518
The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed,
divided by the total number in the labor force

28
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,750
(remember, the total number in the labor force
is the people who have jobs, plus the unemployed).

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,260
US labor force participation is about 50%,
meaning that about half the US population

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,298
is either working, or actively seeking work.
So in late 2009, the labor force was about

31
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,610
150 million out of a population of 300 million,
and the national unemployment rate was approaching

32
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,140
10%.

33
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,359
In the end about 15 million people wanting
to work were out searching for work.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,950
NEXT TIME: Types of unemployment.
