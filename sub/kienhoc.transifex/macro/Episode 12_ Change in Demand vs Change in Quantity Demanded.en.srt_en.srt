Now we know, the demand is just a collection
of price-quantity demanded combinations, showing

2
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:11,919
(all else constant) that price and quantity
demanded are inversely related. Question:

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,980
What happens to demand if price goes up? Answer:
nothing.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,070
Look; if I started out at price P1, then I
would see that the associated willingness

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:29,070
to purchase (or quantity demanded) is Q1.
Now price goes up to P2. What happened in

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,530
the demand line? Nothing. But we do see a
new lower willingness to purchase (quantity

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:42,530
demanded) at Q2. The demand itself did not
change, since both of the combinations (P1,Q1,

8
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:51,010
and P2,Q2) were already part of the existing
demand curve. A change in the price of the

9
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,170
product itself will NEVER change the underlying
demand, only the quantity demanded, shown

10
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,040
by a movement along the existing demand curve.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,289
Is there anything that could alter the underlying
demand, causing it to move either to the right

12
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,109
(indicating that there is a greater willingness
to purchase, even without a price change),

13
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:14,729
or to the left (indicating a decreased willingness
to purchase, even at the same price)? Well,

14
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,609
yes -- the change in any of the other factors
-- other than the product price -- will fundamentally

15
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:26,908
alter the underlying demand. Like what? Well,
any of that other stuff. OK, for instance,

16
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,670
if I stick with the housing market example,
a change in the price of housing will not

17
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,179
shift the demand. Rather, it will cause movement
along the existing demand for housing, or

18
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:42,049
a change in the quantity demanded. BUT -- what
about mortgage rates? Even if housing prices

19
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:48,139
are unchanged, an increase in mortgage rates
leads to a lower willingness to buy at all

20
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:53,139
prices, and of course lower mortgage rates
would lead to an increased willingness to

21
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:55,399
buy at all prices.

22
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,399
What about changes in related markets? For
example, take a look at the link between the

23
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,619
market for apartments in the market for houses.
Initially the price of a typical apartment

24
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:11,720
is P1. Q1 apartments get rented, and there
is some demand in the related market for homes.

25
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,879
But what happens when apartment rents increase?
Sure, some folks will just pay the rent increase,

26
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,700
but others will start thinking, ”Is this
worth it? Wouldn’t it be better for me to

27
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,189
put my money into my own home, instead of
giving it to a landlord every month?” Such

28
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:31,870
individuals now move over to the housing market,
causing a greater quantity demanded at every

29
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,650
existing price; that is, the market demand
shifts to the right, showing the effect of

30
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,760
a change in a substitute product market.

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,980
What about, say, changes in income? Typically
you would expect that as a person's income

32
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,939
rises, that person would purchase more goods
and services. If indeed this is the result,

33
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:57,879
that is, an increase in income leads to an
increase in demand, then the product is a

34
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:04,140
normal good. Occasionally, however, an increase
in income may result in a decrease in demand

35
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,298
for a particular good. If this happens, you're
dealing with an inferior good; typically,

36
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:14,260
inferior goods are low-budget items where,
if you had more money, you’d buy something

37
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:21,048
else -- something nicer – instead. You know
– ramen noodles, mac &amp; cheese, canned tuna,

38
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,989
generic brands, that type of thing. We could
even use the housing example again, where

39
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,950
demand for apartments (or living with your
parents) falls as your income rises, and you

40
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,689
look for a home of your own. In this example,
the homes are normal good, and apartments

41
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,349
are inferior good.

42
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:45,349
What about expectations? From 2003 to 2005,
investors expected huge increase in home values,

43
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,629
especially in the Phoenix metropolitan area.
What happened to the demand for houses? Because

44
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:58,379
everyone expected higher prices tomorrow,
there was a rush to buy the homes today.

45
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,879
OK, one more example of demand shifter: what
about the price of complementary goods, commodities

46
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,230
that must be used in conjunction with this
product? In the housing example, wouldn’t

47
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,819
Homeowners’ Association fees affect the
home-buying decision? Perhaps an even better

48
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:21,920
illustration of complementary goods would
be gas and cars. In the 1990s, gas was cheap

49
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,780
-- oil was $22 a barrel and gas was about
a dollar a gallon. And demand for cars -- especially

50
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,780
trucks and SUVs -- was high. In 2008, oil
hit $140 per barrel, and gasoline hit four

51
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:42,670
dollars plus per gallon. How did this affect
the demand for cars, especially the gas guzzlers?

52
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,820
There is a critical difference between a change
in demand and a change in quantity demanded.

53
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,670
Can you distinguish between the two? A change
in quantity demanded is a movement along the

54
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,440
existing demand, caused by change in the price
of product. A change in demand is a shift

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,230
of the entire demand curve, caused by a change
in anything that affects your willingness

56
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,280
or ability to buy, other than the product
price.
