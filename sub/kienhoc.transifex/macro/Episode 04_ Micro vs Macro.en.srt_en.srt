I have a question for you: If economics is
simply an issue of examining how people choose

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:12,469
to use THIS many resources to satisfy THIS
many wants, why do we have both macroeconomics

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,330
and microeconomics?

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,230
Really it's a question of scope: microeconomics
deals with choices of a single entity -- one

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:28,230
product, one price, one consumer, one household,
one business… or even one industry. Macroeconomics,

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,350
on the other hand, deals with the actions
of the economy as a whole -- the country’s

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,370
income, which we’ll call GDP, all prices
(or “inflation”), the business sector

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,699
(which is all businesses), or unemployment
across the entire economy.
