Back in the 1700s, Adam Smith was the first
person to formalize a model of international

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,660
trade. Smith figured out that if countries
specialized in producing those items where

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,810
they had absolute advantage (absolute advantage
means that your country can produce the good

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,839
the lower resource cost than other countries
in production), and purchased items where

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,148
they had an absolute disadvantage in production,
they be better off. So if Country A could

6
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:32,599
produce food using less labor than Country
B, and Country B could produce furniture using

7
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,860
less labor than Country A, then it will be
mutually beneficial for the countries to trade

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,570
with each other.

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,550
About 100 years later, David Ricardo pointed
out a flaw in the model: he argued that while

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,879
England, let's say, had absolute advantage
in most types of products (that is, England

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,530
could produce most items using fewer resources),
it could still gain by specializing in production

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,570
according to comparative advantage, rather
than absolute advantage. Comparative advantage

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,150
means that your country can produce at the
lowest indirect, or opportunity cost. I saw

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,090
an example several years ago, in Todd Buccholz’s
From Here Economy, that has become my absolute

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,909
favorite for illustrating the different types
of productive advantages, and the resulting

16
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,960
trade patterns: he uses Gilligan's Island.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,038
In his example, the world is like Gilligan's
Island. On the island, the only two people

18
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:24,450
who seem to produce anything are the Skipper
and Gilligan. Because their group is marooned

19
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,319
on an island, Gilligan and Skipper need to
provide for the basic necessities for their

20
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,139
five passengers: food and shelter (inexplicably,
the passengers all seem to have enough clothing

21
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,839
to last for years, even though it was supposed
to be a three-hour pleasure cruise). Since

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,159
they’re on island, it's natural that they’ll
be eating lot of fish dinners and then, they’ll

23
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,159
also need to build huts for shelter.

24
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,329
To build a single hut -- framing it, adding
walls, thatching the roof -- Skipper needs

25
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,818
20 hours. Gilligan, on the other hand, is
not very competent; he tends to knock the

26
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:57,340
hut over a time or two before completion,
and takes 45 hours to finish a hut. Skipper

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,979
came get down to the lagoon, catch enough
fish for seven people, come back, clean the

28
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:06,349
fish and cook the fish dinner in 10 hours.
Gilligan? He falls into the lagoon, loses

29
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:10,860
his equipment, and initially burns the dinner,
taking 15 hours total to produce an edible

30
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,250
fish dinner.

31
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,550
One more piece of information I'm going to
need, here: how many resources do each of

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,640
our producers have to work with? Well, Skipper
is a pretty average guy, working 40 hours

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,390
a week, 50 weeks a year (he takes the occasional
week’s vacation on the other side of the

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:31,369
island to unwind), for a total of 2000 hours.
Gilligan, on the other hand, isn’t as skilled

35
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,320
as the Skipper at producing, but he’s got
a good heart and will work extra hard until

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,880
he makes things right. In the end, Gilligan
works 3600 hours per year. Think about it:

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,519
isn’t that the way things work in the real
world? Which countries are more like the Skipper

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,750
-- skilled labor, but not as much of it -- and
which countries are more like Gilligan, with

39
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,110
lots of unskilled labor?

40
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,910
OK, in terms of who should be producing which
product, what would Adam Smith say? Remember,

41
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,400
Smith thought that specialization should be
dictated by who has absolute advantage, that

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,080
is, who can produce at the lowest resource
cost. In this case, Skipper actually produces

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,040
both items using less labor hours, so he has
absolute advantage in both products. Smith

44
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,670
would say that Skipper should produce both
products. What should Gilligan do? Well, he

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,429
can’t really hurt anyone, if he sits in
his own little corner of the island and produces

46
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,610
both as well. Let's say that the two producers
each split their resources – time -- evenly

47
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,590
among the two products.

48
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,920
Skipper will spend 1000 hours on hut building
and 1000 hours on fish dinners. In the end,

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,619
Skipper builds 50 huts and creates 100 fish
dinners. In the meantime, Gilligan will spend

50
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,620
1800 hours on hut building, and 1800 hours
on fishing. Ultimately, he will build 40 huts

51
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,579
and create 120 fish dinners. In total, the
overall island production between the two

52
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,870
producers is 90 huts, and 220 fish dinners.

53
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,510
Now, what would David Ricardo say? Remember,
Ricardo thought that specialization should

54
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,560
be dictated by who has the comparative advantage
-- that is, who can produce at the lowest

55
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,440
opportunity cost (you can go back to Episode
8 if you need a refresher on opportunity cost).

56
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,690
How do we know where the comparative advantage
lies? Well, let's start by taking a look at

57
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,400
Skipper: every hut he builds takes 20 hours;
had he used the 20 hours on fishing, he could

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,039
have produced 2 fish dinners. So Skipper's
opportunity cost of producing one hut is that

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,750
he sacrifices 2 fish dinners. What about Gilligan?
He takes 45 hours to build a hut, in which

60
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:46,170
time he could've produced 3 fish dinners.
This means that Skipper has comparative advantage

61
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,139
in hut production.

62
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,419
Now, some of you might be thinking, “Well
of course Skipper has comparative advantage

63
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:57,570
-- he's better at everything!” This is not
necessarily true; let's look at fish dinners.

64
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:04,570
To produce a fish dinner takes the Skipper
10 hours, or he sacrifices 1/2 of a hut. Gilligan

65
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:11,370
takes 15 hours, but he sacrifices only 1/3
of a hut. Gilligan actually has the comparative

66
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,060
advantage in fishing, because he sacrifices
less, or has the lowest opportunity cost.

67
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,250
According to Ricardo, Skipper should devote
himself and his resources solely to producing

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:30,060
huts. If he uses all 2000 hours on hut production,
he can produce a total of 100 huts. Gilligan

69
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,310
uses all of his resources for fishing, and
can produce 240 fish dinners. What do you

70
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:42,130
notice about total island production? Specialization
according to comparative advantage yields

71
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:49,130
total output of 100 huts and 240 fish dinners,
compared to the 90 huts and 220 fish dinners

72
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,120
that are produced when following specialization
according to absolute advantage.

73
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,210
What does this mean in the real world? Specialization
according to comparative advantage leads to

74
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,239
increased global production, which means better
living standards for everyone.
