Remember the three macroeconomic goals -- price
stability, low unemployment, and high &amp; sustained

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,989
economic growth? Is there a tool that we can
use to allow us to understand how price level

3
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:18,989
(P), unemployment (U), and real GDP, or quantity
of goods and services (Q) are determined?

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,810
Well, we already have a tool, sort of: we’ll
just need to adapt it. It's the market tool:

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,979
the supply and demand diagram. Think about
the supply and demand in a particular market

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,059
determine the price and quantity in that market.
The issue is that the supply and demand in

7
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,169
a particular market help you find the price
of one product, not the price level of all

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,120
products, and the quantity of one product,
not the quantity of all goods and services

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,140
(also known as GDP). The single market supply
and demand diagram is actually pretty simple

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,350
to modify into a macroeconomic model. Instead
of looking at the demand for one product or

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,399
service, we look at the aggregate demand for
all products and services; and rather than

12
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,620
the supply of a single commodity or service,
let's use the aggregate supply of all commodities

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,790
and services. Then the equilibrium will represent
the macroeconomic equilibrium; rather than

14
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,730
the equilibrium price of a single product
or service, it yields the equilibrium price

15
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,670
level of the prices for all goods and services.
And instead of the equilibrium quantity of

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,950
a single commodity, the equilibrium quantity
of all goods and services, i.e., the real

17
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,910
GDP, is yielded. So let's take a closer look
at our modified market model, starting with

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,649
the aggregate demand.

19
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,610
Whereas demand for single product is a collection
of all the quantities demanded for that product

20
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,390
at various prices, and exhibiting an inverse
relationship, the aggregate demand for all

21
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,720
goods and services is an inverse relationship
between price level in the economy and the

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,679
quantity of all goods and services demanded,
or a collection of all the aggregate quantities

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,200
demanded for all goods and services at various
price levels in the economy. Why is there

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,850
an inverse relationship? That is, why are
fewer goods and services demanded when price

25
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:13,480
levels are higher? Well, for a number of reasons
really; if the overall price level for all

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,369
goods and services is increasing, other things
remaining equal, the existing income cannot

27
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,859
buy as much as it used to. Another reason
is that as the domestic price level rises,

28
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:29,719
foreign goods start to look much more attractive;
households, businesses, and the foreign sector

29
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:35,900
shy away from buying our more expensive goods.
Also, higher prices tend to drive interest

30
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,670
rates up (more on that later, when we discuss
credit markets), but that also depresses the

31
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,439
amount of goods and services that the four
sectors can buy, or want to buy.

32
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,999
Just like demand for single product, a change
in the price level will not shift aggregate

33
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:56,109
demand, but only cause a movement along it.
Is there anything that can shift aggregate

34
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:02,129
demand? Sure -- at a given price level, anything
that changes total expenditures will change

35
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:07,310
the overall aggregate demand. Do you remember
who makes expenditures on goods and services?

36
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,040
The household sector, the business sector,
the government sector, and the foreign sector.

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,798
This means that anything other than the price
level that affects household consumption (C),

38
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:25,799
business investment (I), government spending
(G), or net exports (X) will shift aggregate

39
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,738
demand. For example, in the 1990s, the US
stock market really boomed, and many households

40
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:38,409
found themselves, as the market climbed, with
increased wealth. This led to increased spending,

41
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:44,010
or a rightward shift of aggregate demand.
TIME TO THINK: for discussion in our next

42
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:51,010
class, what kinds of things, other than prices,
could cause a change in 1) consumption, 2)

43
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,650
investment, 3) government spending, or 4)
net exports?

44
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,609
Now what about aggregate supply? The aggregate
supply is the direct relationship between

45
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,779
price level in the economy and the aggregate
quantity of goods and services supplied. The

46
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:13,418
aggregate supply curve, then, is just the
collection of all price level/aggregate quantity

47
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:19,820
supplied combinations. Why is aggregate supply
upward-sloping? Well, for pretty much the

48
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,500
same reasons that a single product supply
curve is upward sloping – cost and profit.

49
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,320
As the price level rises in an economy, other
things staying the same, more producers -- even

50
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,950
inefficient, high-cost producers -- can produce
and survive. At a lower price levels, only

51
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,430
the lowest-cost producers can continue. On
the profit side, at higher price levels, other

52
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,180
things staying the same, profits are higher,
giving greater incentive to produce. TIME

53
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:53,180
TO THINK: for our next class, what can shift
aggregate supply? Again, changes in price

54
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,270
level will only cause movement along aggregate
supply; what types of changes could occur

55
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,490
that would have a broad effect on all types
of production throughout the economy?

56
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,410
Where aggregate demand and aggregate supply
meet, we find our macroeconomic equilibrium.

57
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,270
The price level, the quantity of goods and
services, or GDP, and even an implied unemployment

58
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,010
level (more GDP means more jobs and lower
unemployment, lower GDP means fewer jobs and

59
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,270
higher unemployment). How will changes in
aggregate demand and aggregate supply affect

60
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,240
prices, GDP, and unemployment?

61
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,070
NEXT TIME: Does the economy self-adjust?
