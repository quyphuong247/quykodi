So what do graphs have to do with economics?
Well, they provide a very useful way to build

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:12,849
a simplified visual of how the world works.
OK, since economics is all about the choices

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:17,640
that people make, let’s look at an example
that all of you have in common: how a student

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,230
taking an economics class chooses to use his
or her time. Let’s make a couple of assumptions

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,509
about our student: after carefully evaluating
for time spent at work, sleeping, eating,

6
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:35,509
social activities, family… there’s 10
hours of study time each week. Also, data

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,890
shows that most students who take economics
are full-time, so let's assume that this student

8
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,629
is taking a second course. I know, I know
-- in the real world, full-time means four

9
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,789
or more courses, but I'm going to limit the
number of classes to two. For one, it's hard

10
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:57,210
to draw a diagram in three dimensions, and
I’d like to see you try four or five! For

11
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,449
another, you’ll see that even assuming only
two classes, we can use this simplified model

12
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,880
to illustrate how people make their choices.

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,589
Now, what's the measurable objective of the
student who's taking two classes -- let's

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,180
say economics and math -- and has 10 hours
per week to study? Grades -- how well the

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,120
student is doing is measured by grades. So
let's put all this information in graphical

16
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,120
form. First, I set up my two axes and label
each. One will be the grade in economics;

17
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,860
the other will be the grade in math. What's
the possible range of grades?

18
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,770
Anywhere from an F to an A -- or, since we’re
counting on this graph, anywhere from 0.0

19
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:48,770
to 4.0. This is true for the grade in economics
axis as well as the grade in math axis. Now,

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,500
our student goes to classes on the first day.
Math class isn’t very stimulating, but the

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Econ class is great! You go home, check Blackboard,
rewrite your notes, do the practice sets,

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,960
form a study group -- before you know it,
your 10 hours are gone! If indeed you put

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,549
in 10 hours per week in economics, it's quite
likely you’ll get an “A.” BUT… this

24
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,290
leaves you with zero hours to work on math!
If you do NO studying or homework for math,

25
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,540
you’re going to get an “F.” This is
our first point on the graph.

26
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,799
What if you begin to spend a little time each
week on math? Maybe you start spending about

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,470
2 1/2 hours on math, and cut back to 7 1/2
hours economics. Well, the math grade is going

28
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,660
to go up, and that's good news; now you're
at least getting a “D” in math. But because

29
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,020
you took time away from economics, the economics
grade is going to fall from an “A” to

30
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,780
a “B.”

31
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,300
And so on... I can follow this pattern. If
I were to spend my time such that I was using

32
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:58,300
five hours for each class, I would get a “C”
in each class. If I decide to spend 7 1/2

33
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,090
hours on my math class, leaving me with only
2 1/2 hours for Econ, the good news is my

34
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,980
math grade is up to a “B”; my economics
grade, down to a “D.” Finally, I could

35
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,220
spend all 10 hours on the math class, giving
me an “A” in the math class, which is

36
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,260
great -- but that leaves me nothing to study
for economics, and now I'm failing my economics

37
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,970
class.

38
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,900
Are there any other combinations the student
could choose? Sure; he or she could pick,

39
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,330
I don’t know, seven hours and three hours,
or 6.2 hours and 3.8 hours, or one hour and

40
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,120
nine hours -- there are an infinite number
of combinations. These would be shown in the

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,660
diagram between the points we've already chosen.
Did you notice that, once we’ve included

42
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,670
all the points, this looks more like a solid,
downward-sloping line than just some collection

43
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:55,670
of points? This is a production possibilities
curve or a PPC, also referred to as a production

44
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,359
possibilities frontier, or PPF.

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,360
By definition, the PPC (or PPF) shows all
possible combinations of output that can be

46
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,770
produced, assuming two things: 1) a fixed
amount of productive resources of a given

47
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,019
quality, and 2) efficient use of those resources.

48
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:23,090
Well, did we do all this stuff? Hm; yeah -- we
looked at all possible combinations of output

49
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,940
by examining all possible combinations of
grades that were being produced; a fixed amount

50
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,930
of productive resources is 10 hours of the
student’s labor; and efficient use of the

51
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,700
resources; well, by definition, efficiency
means that there is no unused, or wasted,

52
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,400
or unemployed resources, and with every combination
we made sure that the student was using all

53
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,570
10 hours, so there's no unused study time.

54
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,840
The production possibilities curve illustrates
the positive analysis -- all possible ways

55
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,750
in which the student can choose to use his
or her time. Now for the normative question:

56
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:06,560
what combination will the student choose?
What point will the student choose? Well,

57
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,480
it depends on the decision-maker. A student
might choose a “C” in both classes, because

58
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,610
at least they’d be passing both classes.
But what if the GPA in your major matters

59
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,389
more than your overall GPA? If you’re a
business student, you might choose a “B”

60
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:26,070
or an “A” in economics, then, over a passing
grade in math.

61
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,099
Now, I can tell you aren’t satisfied with
these choices; you're thinking, “Can’t

62
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,710
I get an ‘A’ in both?” No! Under the
current assumptions -- 10 hours of study -- this

63
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,590
combination is currently unattainable. Could
I ever get there? Well, sure, if you can get

64
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,138
some more time from somewhere – those additional
10 hours somehow; maybe if you cut back at

65
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,919
work, dropped another class, or stopped sleeping,
I don't know.

66
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:59,340
Could the student choose, say, a “D” in
both classes? Certainly, but you're wasting

67
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,070
your resources; you're not using all of your
study hours for the intended purpose, which

68
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,960
is getting the grades in the classes.

69
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,448
So you see, even our very simple graphical
model tells us a lot about how a person with

70
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,790
more needs than resources must make decisions.
