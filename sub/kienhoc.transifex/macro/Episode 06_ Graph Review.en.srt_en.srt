Ah, graphs – love ‘em or hate ‘em, they
will be an absolutely essential tool for analyzing

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,550
economic behavior in this class. If you're
already a graph meister, feel free to turn

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,530
this thing off right now. I just want to go
through very basic review.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,109
OK, repeat after me: “Graphs are easy. I
can do this. All I need to do is count.”

5
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,090
No, really! After all, what’s a basic number
line, except the graph? Of course, we will

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,670
want to look at relationships between things,
so we need to be able to count two things

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,800
at the same time. I can do this by adding
a second number line. The good news is typically

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,819
we won't even need all of this -- since we
very rarely deal with negative numbers, we

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,010
can leave these areas out, so that we soon
have a more familiar-looking set of lines,

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,110
one horizontal, and one vertical. These two
lines -- the axes -- will allow us to measure

11
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,750
what's happening between two variables (I’ll
call them something generic right now, like

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,940
X and Y).

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,280
It's possible the X and Y will exhibit what's
known as a positive, or direct, relationship.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,670
If they do, then X and Y will move together
-- that is, both of them increase, or both

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,970
of them decrease, together. Let me give you
an example: instead of “X”, what if I

16
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,770
have “The number of A’s that Dr. McGlasson
gives this semester”? Instead of “Y,”

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,539
I have “the number of students who enroll
for the class next semester.” If I never

18
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,689
give an “A,” people aren’t going to
be very anxious to sign up for my class, and

19
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:39,250
I have very low enrollment. If I give lots
of “A’s,” however, the class gets to

20
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,759
be very popular, and lots of students enroll.
So I see that there is a positive, or direct,

21
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,320
relationship between the number of A's that
are given, and the number of students who

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,398
enroll for the class in the future.

23
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,399
Alternatively, X and Y may exhibit a negative,
or indirect, relationship. If they do, then

24
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:06,909
X and Y will move in opposite directions;
that is, as one rises, the other falls. For

25
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:13,680
example, instead of the number of A's on horizontal
axis, I put the number of F’s given by Dr.

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,870
McGlasson, and then on the vertical axis,
I’m going to keep the number of students

27
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,980
enrolling in the class. If I fail practically
everyone in the class, why would anyone want

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,980
to take my class in the future? I find that
a large number of F’s translates to a fairly

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,959
low number of students enrolling. If I hardly
ever fail anyone, lots of students are going

30
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,849
to take my class so very small number of F’s
translates to a fairly high level of enrollment.

31
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,349
So I’m finding that there's a negative,
or inverse, relationship between the number

32
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:57,349
of F’s that I give and future enrollment
in my class. This negative or inverse relationship

33
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,090
exhibited between the two variables has a
negative slope.

34
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,110
There is one final possibility: X and Y could
exhibit a constant, or independent, relationship.

35
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,450
Let me give you an example where I have two
completely unrelated variables that are going

36
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,459
to illustrate this. What if, on the horizontal
axis, I have the number of students enrolled

37
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,220
in my class; on the vertical axis, the number
of dogs in the McGlasson household (I happen

38
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,060
to have two)?

39
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:34,060
Now, whether I have no students, 50 students,
150 students -- I'm going to have two dogs.

40
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,150
So if no students enrolled? Two dogs. 50 students
enrolled? Two dogs. 150 students enrolled?

41
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,530
Two dogs. I find with the constant or independent
relationship, I have a straight horizontal

42
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:55,209
line that's not showing either positive or
negative slope; it's got a slope of zero.

43
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,849
The number of dogs is completely unchanging
as the number of students changes.

44
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,329
Over the course of the semester, I'll ask
you whether you can identify a relationship

45
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,650
as being a positive relationship or negative
relationship, so you may want to see if you

46
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:17,019
can think of some examples of each to give
yourself some practice.

47
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,889
NEXT TIME: How do you use graphs to illustrate
scarcity and choice?
