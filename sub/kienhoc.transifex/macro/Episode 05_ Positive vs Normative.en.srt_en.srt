It's crucial as an economist, or any analyst
for that matter, that you can distinguish

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:12,020
between positive analysis and normative analysis.
Positive analysis is factual analysis; the

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,060
analysis of what is. You can recognize a positive
statement because it can be tested; it can

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,960
be proven, or disproven. There are no personal
judgments involved. For example, I can tell

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,960
you that it is 72ยก outside today, and you
can verify that my statement is true (or untrue).

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,820
Normative analysis, on the other hand, is
opinion-based analysis -- the analysis of

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,230
what should be or ought to be. We can recognize
a normative statement because it involves

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,790
personal judgments or ideals; it cannot be
proven or disproven. When I tell you the orange

9
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:54,600
is better than red, can you verify this? Can
you test it? Can you prove it, or disprove

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,649
it?

11
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,190
In the end, we need both types to make policy.
The think-tank groups engage in positive analysis,

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,619
and then turn their findings over to the policy
makers, who use this information (along their

13
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,950
own judgment) to create policies that they
feel are best for society. If you happen to

14
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,299
disagree with their policies, then you can
vote for someone else.

15
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,229
Take a look at a headline from today's news.
Can you distinguish the positive statements

16
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:22,709
from the normative statements?
