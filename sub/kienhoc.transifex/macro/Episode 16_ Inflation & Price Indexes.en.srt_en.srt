There are three macroeconomic goals that we
want to keep an eye on to determine the health

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:11,509
of any economy: 1) stable prices, 2) low unemployment,
and 3) high and sustained economic growth.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,198
The challenge for us right now is to figure
out how each of these goals would be measured,

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,249
and what each of these goals means. For now
let's just address the first goal: stable

5
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:25,429
prices.

6
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:30,979
First of all, in this context, what do we
mean by “price”? Since is this a macroeconomic

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,020
goal, we aren’t talking about the price
of a single product, but rather the price

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,680
of all products -- some kind of aggregate
price, or a weighted average of all the prices,

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,710
a representative price index. While there
may price indices out there, which price index

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,980
you use often depends on the type of question
you want to ask. The most common is the consumer

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,980
price index, or CPI. Sometimes you hear about
the core index, which is essentially CPI that

12
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,730
leaves out food and energy prices. These two
are typically the most volatile areas, i.e.,

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,409
changing or fluctuating the most, and can
make it look like the average of all prices

14
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,690
is changing, when in fact everything other
than food and energy is pretty stable. How

15
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,530
is such a price index constructed?

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,140
Let me give you an overly simplistic view
of the CPI. Suppose that a “typical” household

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,580
purchases 10 apples, 5 gallons of gas, and
3 pairs of jeans. I want to know overall,

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,610
if prices are rising. To answer this question,
I need to know what this market basket cost

19
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:39,340
initially, and what it costs now. Let's say
that in our base year (this is our benchmark

20
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,890
year, which will serve as a point of reference),
the price of an apple is $.20, the price of

21
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,479
a gallon of gas is $1, in the price of a pair
of jeans is $10. This means that in the base

22
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:56,479
year, the market basket would've cost $37;
$2 to purchase 10 apples at $.20 each, $5

23
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:03,250
to purchase 5 gallons of gas at $1 each, and
$30 to buy three pairs of jeans at $10 each.

24
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,330
And in the current year? Let’s say that
in the current year, an apple costs $.70,

25
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,240
a gallon of gas costs $4, and a pair jeans
costs $30. This means that in the current

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,240
year, the same market basket will cost $117;
$7 for the apples, $20 for the gas, and $90

27
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,940
for the three pairs of jeans. Because the
entire cost of the market basket is higher

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,290
than it used to be, this means that overall,
the price level must have gone up.

29
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,640
In this particular example, this seems to
be belaboring the obvious; we can see that

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,869
each individual price has gone up, so overall,
the average level of prices must have gone

31
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,670
up. But this market basket approach is useful
if we can't see individual prices or if, as

32
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,458
is the case for the actual CPI, there are
hundreds of products, with some prices rising

33
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,930
and some prices falling.

34
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,910
How does the market basket idea help us in
finding a price index, or some indicator of

35
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,569
what's happening to the overall level of prices?
In this example, we can use the changing value

36
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:13,829
of the market basket to construct a CPI, where
the CPI for the year in question is the ratio

37
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,950
of the total expenditure in that year, over
the original total expenditure, or the expenditure

38
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,250
in the base, or benchmark, year; and then
I have to multiply all of it times 100. In

39
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,840
this case, that would be a current expenditure
of $117, over the base year expenditure of

40
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,310
only $37, times 100. This means the CPI for
the current year is about 316.

41
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,830
OK, so I could train just about anyone to
plug the numbers into this formula; in the

42
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:48,200
end, what does a CPI at 316 mean? Before I
answer this question, let me ask you one more

43
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:55,200
thing: What is the CPI of the base year? Well,
since the CPI we seek is base year CPI, we

44
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,800
have to take base year expenditures, over
base year expenditures, all times 100. The

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,800
CPI of the base year is going to be 100. What
does this mean? It means that base year prices

46
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,470
are 100% of base year prices. The prices are
neither higher, nor lower, than we started.

47
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,918
Of COURSE this is true; no change in the price
level has yet occurred! In the base year,

48
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:27,109
the index is always 100. This helps me to
interpret index numbers that are not 100.

49
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,639
If you find an index less than 100, then prices
have decreased compared to the base year.

50
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,220
If you find a price index more than 100, prices
have gone up compared to the base year. Back

51
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,530
to our current price index of 316, then, it
signifies that prices are over three times

52
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,469
higher than they were originally.

53
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:52,300
If a price index like the CPI indicates the
current level of prices, how do we measure

54
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,750
changes in the price level? First of all,
we’re to need to look at percentage change

55
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,910
rather than absolute change. Let me show you
what I mean. If I tell you that product price

56
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:09,250
has gone up by $1, is this a big change, or
a small change? Well, as usual, it depends:

57
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,650
if we’re talking about, say, a pack of gum,
where the original price was $1 and the new

58
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:21,650
price is $2, that is an absolute change of
$1. But is a big change, or a small change?

59
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,599
This will be a big change; price doubled,
or increased by 100%. What if instead, we’re

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,380
talking about textbook? If the book originally
cost $100, and now it’s $101, that's an

61
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:41,590
absolute change of $1. But is it a big change,
or a small change? For the book, it's a small

62
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,739
change; price increased by 1%. In the end,
we need to know not only the dollar amount

63
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,330
of the price change, but also how this compares
to where we started. The same is true of the

64
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,780
overall price level. We need to look at percentage
change of the price index.

65
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,349
The formula to calculate the percentage change
in the overall price level is the difference

66
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:09,259
between the new CPI and the old CPI, all over
the old CPI, times 100 to get it in percentage

67
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:15,090
terms. How do I use this formula? Let's use
the CPI numbers were calculated earlier as

68
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:22,090
an example: the percentage change in price
is the new CPI (316) minus the old CPI (100),

69
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:30,370
over 100, times 100 to get it in percentage
terms -- or an increase of 216%. This means

70
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,340
that prices have risen 216% from the base
year to the current year.

71
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,549
At this point you may be asking yourself,
“Why do we have to use this stupid formula?

72
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,850
I could've gotten the same answer by just
taking the difference between the two CPI's!”

73
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,130
While that's true for this particular example,
that little trick only works if you're comparing

74
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,210
against the base year. Let me show you.

75
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,239
What if I want to know how much inflation
there was, that is, how much prices changed,

76
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,240
from 1998 to 2008? In 1998, CPI was 163; the
CPI in 2008 was 215.3. The index is higher,

77
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,710
so clearly the general price level has increased,
but by how much? It's tempting to just take

78
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:21,318
the difference between the two, and say that
inflation was 52.3% over the ten-year period,

79
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:27,720
but that would be incorrect. Note that 1998
is not the base year. How do I know that neither

80
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,280
of the two years as the base year…? Hmm…

81
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,280
OK, let's use the formula: percentage change
in price from 1998 to 2008 is the CPI in 2008,

82
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,840
minus the old CPI in 1998, all over the CPI
in ’98, times 100… OR, [(215.3 - 163)/163]x100,

83
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
which gives us approximately a 32.1% increase
in the price level from 1998 to 2008, NOT

84
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,130
a 52.3% increase.

85
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:13,130
By definition, inflation is a sustained increase
in the overall level of prices. If the percentage

86
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,020
change in the prices is greater than zero
for a sustained period, typically two consecutive

87
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,380
quarters (that's six months or longer) we
call it inflation. If the percentage change

88
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,719
in price is less than zero for a sustained
period, we call it deflation.

89
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Think back to the first macroeconomic goal:
stable prices. Notice that the goal is not

90
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:43,739
low prices; deflation, or decreasing prices,
can be just as dangerous as inflation, or

91
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:48,829
increasing prices. Think about this: lower
prices mean smaller quantity supplied of all

92
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:55,399
goods and services. This means there's less
need for labor, so workers get laid off. Unemployed

93
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:01,309
workers spend less, bringing demand and prices
down, which means lower quantity supplied,

94
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:06,360
which means… well, you get the picture.
In fact, the one decade in the 20th century

95
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,009
that was characterized worldwide by deflation
was the 1930s: the Great Depression.

96
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:15,100
NEXT TIME: Real Income.
