The whole societal scenario, where the production
possibilities curve (or production possibilities

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,860
frontier) is fixed, and the choice will be
some point on that fixed curve, stems from

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,539
the original assumption that the resources
are fixed.

4
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:19,259
Just as a quick recap, what are the categories
of resources? Remember, land is any natural

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,260
resource, labor is any human service, capital
(which is NOT money) is machinery and equipment,

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,890
and the last category is entrepreneurial ability,
where the entrepreneur is someone who 1) recognizes

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,710
a profit opportunity, 2) is willing to accept
risk, and 3) is able to organize the other

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,579
resources.

9
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:45,890
But -- what if the resources aren’t fixed?
If resources change, what happens to production

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,329
possibilities? The answer, of course, is “it
depends.” If there are suddenly more resources,

11
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,989
then there is a greater capability to produce,
and the PPC moves outward, or shifts to the

12
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,839
right. Now, just to illustrate side point,
let me call the two broad categories of output

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,170
agriculture, like wheat, and manufacturing,
like computers. These categories are often

14
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,549
used in production possibilities models because
they use resources differently; agriculture

15
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:19,020
tends to be more labor-intensive, whereas
manufacturing tends to be more capital (or

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,590
machinery) - intensive. Why does this matter?
Well, I just wanted to point out that underlying

17
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,049
resources changes won't necessarily result
in a nice, even, parallel shift of the production

18
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:30,530
possibilities.

19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:37,180
Consider this: suppose we’re producing efficiently,
using all of our resources, operating on PPC1.

20
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,439
Then suddenly, someone discovers a fabulous
new fertilizer that doubles crop yields. What

21
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,658
happens to the possible agricultural output
when you use all of the existing resources,

22
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,790
plus you add this fabulous new fertilizer?
You can now produce much more wheat than you

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,210
could before.

24
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,970
But what happens to the manufacturing output
will use all of the existing resources, and

25
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:06,970
then add fertilizer? Probably nothing. So
the new PPC (PPC2), does illustrate an expanded

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,540
ability to produce but it's an uneven shift.
For now though, just to keep things simpler,

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,079
I'm just going to show even, parallel shifts.
So -- where were we? OK -- an increase in

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,000
resources will result in an outward shift
of PPC, demonstrating a greater ability to

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
produce.

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,840
OK, then what happens if resources decrease?
Fewer resources mean less ability to produce

31
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,738
so the production possibilities will shrink,
or shift inward. Now I want you to think about

32
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:45,010
something. What does it actually mean to say
that there is an increase or a decrease in

33
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:51,239
resources? How does it happen, more specifically,
how would a society see more land, more labor,

34
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,200
more capital, or more entrepreneurial ability?
In this table, I've gotten you started; now

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,549
you complete the rest.
