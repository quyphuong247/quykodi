The first thing you need to know about how
money is created in the US is that we have

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,490
a fractional reserve banking system, meaning
that banks are allowed to hold reserves equal

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,549
to only a fraction of their total deposit
liabilities.

4
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:19,400
Look, think of a bank as being like a person
like you or me; how do we hold our money?

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,549
We usually keep a little cash on hand, and
then keep the rest in the bank. Well, a bank

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,120
does the same thing. The total bank reserves
are partly cash on hand, or vault cash, and

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,899
the rest sits in an account with the banker’s
bank, the Federal Reserve (this is the central

8
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,010
bank for the United States).

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,059
Now, banks are legally required to keep a
certain amount of their total deposits -- that

10
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,280
is, the total of what their depositors have
entrusted them with – on reserve. This can

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,609
be either as vault cash, or on deposit at
the Fed, as long as it is accessible if the

12
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,399
depositors ask for their money. The required
reserve ratio, r, is the legally mandated

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,389
percentage, so the total amount of required
reserves is the required reserve ratio times

14
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:07,860
the total amount that's been deposited with
the bank, or r x total deposits.

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,300
The difference between the bank’s total
reserves and its required reserves are the

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,820
excess reserves, the amount the bank is holding
above and beyond legal requirement. How, then,

17
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,630
is money created? Banks create money by lending
money, and the money that they can land is

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,310
the excess reserves.

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,410
OK, let me give you an example. Let's say
that I move to this area, bringing $500 with

20
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,000
me, which I use to open an account with Wells
Fargo. This means Wells Fargo now has an additional

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
$500 in assets (my deposit), but also an additional
$500 in liabilities -- I could walk in at

22
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:50,070
any time to get my money back. Now, supposing
the required reserve ratio is 10%, Wells Fargo

23
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,830
must hold onto $50 of my deposit, leaving
$450 in excess reserves.

24
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:03,630
Now let's say that Jim wants to buy new car
stereo, but he needs $450. Wells Fargo lends

25
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,630
Jim the $450 -- that is, the $450 excess reserve
asset is now replaced by the $450 loan that

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,690
Jim will have to pay back -- which he takes
to the car stereo store.

27
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,670
At the end of the day, the stereo retailer
deposits the $450 with its bank, B of A. This

28
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,670
means B of A has a new $450 deposit, $45 of
which is required reserves, leaving $405 in

29
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,549
excess reserves that it can lend out.

30
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,830
How long will this process continue? Well,
in theory it could go on indefinitely, although

31
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,310
the loans would get pretty small after a while.
How much of an effect is there on the money

32
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,310
supply? If I go back to the beginning, there
was my initial $500 deposit, then a new $450

33
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,900
checkable deposit, then another $405, then
$364.50, etcetera. The maximum change in checkable

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,870
deposits, and therefore in the money supply,
is 1/r times the change in reserves.

35
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:11,110
The ratio 1/r is the simple deposit multiplier,
or the money multiplier, in this case, 10.

36
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:18,110
For this example, the maximum change is 10
times $500, or $5000. Why is this the maximum

37
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:24,450
change that we could see in the money supply?
Because banks can lend up to 90% of their

38
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,869
deposits, but they don't have to lend 90%.
In times of high risk, banks would most likely

39
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,700
want to hold onto more than the legally required
fraction of their deposits.

40
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,399
TIME TO THINK: what happens if money is removed
from the banking system? For example, what

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,989
if I now go to Wells Fargo and try to withdraw
the $500 (assume for the moment that I'm their

42
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,220
only depositor)? How will they get my money
back to me, and what happens as a result of

43
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,040
the bank's actions?

44
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,130
