By definition, monetary policy is changes
in the money supply in order to achieve particular

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,908
macroeconomic goals. In many countries, including
the US, itÕs the central bank, rather than

3
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:17,760
any legislative body, that controls monetary
policy. The Federal Reserve system, or the

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,070
Fed for short, is the central bank of the
United States.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,990
The Fed has a very carefully crafted structure.
After we examine that structure, I want to

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,900
have a discussion as to the intent of the
setup. Let's take a look: the Federal Reserve

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,809
system is made up of 12 districts; 12 geographic
regions in the US. Notice how much larger

8
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,059
district 12 is than any of the other districts?
This reflects the much sparser Western population

9
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,989
of the US when the Fed was established.

10
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,568
There is a seven-member board of governors
whose members, once appointed by the president

11
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:55,210
and getting Senate approval, serve 14-year
terms. The terms are staggered with one appointment

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,100
every other year, assuring that there is always
a wide range of experience on the board. One

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,089
member of the Board of Governors is the Chairman
of the board, appointed by the president to

14
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:09,230
a four-year term. Multiple terms can be served;
both Alan Greenspan and William McChesney

15
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,110
Martin each served for nearly 20 years.

16
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,010
The seven-member governing board is a subset
of the larger 12-member Federal Open Market

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:23,850
Committee, or FOMC, which is the policymaking
group within the Fed. The FOMC conducts all

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,500
open market operations (or OMOs). WhatÕs
an OMO? Well, by definition, open market operations

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,780
are the buying and selling of government securities.
WeÕll get to the purpose of OMOs in Episode

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,560
32, Monetary Policy. The FOMC is made up of
the seven-member board of governors, plus

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,750
five of the district bank presidents. The
president of the Federal Reserve of New York

22
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,740
has a permanent position as vice chair of
the FOMC; the other four seats are served

23
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,929
by the other 11 district presidents, on a
rotating basis.

24
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,420
TIME TO THINK: Every aspect of the FedÕs
structure was carefully planned. What is the

25
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,690
purpose of each, that is, how does this structure
help the Fed do its job of managing the US

26
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,060
economy? Can you see any downsides to the
FedÕs structure? In our next class, weÕll

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,390
have a discussion on the pros and cons of
the structure of the Fed, so be sure to have

28
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,230
your answers ready.
