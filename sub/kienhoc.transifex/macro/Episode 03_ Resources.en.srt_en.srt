If economics is all about how people use their
scarce resources to try to satisfy their unlimited

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,420
wants, then it might be a good idea for us
to think about what the term resources actually

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,879
means.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,369
When economists talk about resources they
mean productive resources. The resources actually

5
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:23,730
have to be able to produce something -- a
product or a service. So what kinds of stuff

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,730
do we use to produce goods and services? We
use people, fuel and energy, we use machines,

7
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:37,779
factories, plants, animals... OK, clearly
a lot of things are used in the production

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,970
of goods and services.

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,210
Economists like to simplify things to make
the story more intuitive, so what do you say

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,880
we put all the resources into just a few broad
categories? Land is any natural resource.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,210
Sure, this includes land -- land like farmland
or real estate -- but it also includes trees,

12
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:03,210
plants, livestock, wind, sun, water, oil...
you get the idea.

13
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,679
The category labor refers to any human service-
physical or intellectual. You're adding to

14
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:16,249
the package of labor services that you have
to offer, right now, by learning. Some labor

15
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:20,329
comes naturally; an athletic gift, perhaps,
that allows you to play professional ball

16
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:25,359
to earn a living; but you can certainly add
to your package of labor services, sometimes

17
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,089
referred to as human capital, through job
training, experience, conferences, workshops,

18
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,130
or education.

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,130
The category of capital... Now before I go
one step further, let me say this: money is

20
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:47,030
NOT a resource. Remember what I said about
resources -- they need to be productive. They

21
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,740
have to be used to make something else, and
money can't do that. Don't get me wrong; money

22
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,679
helps the economy move along more efficiently,
more smoothly, like grease for the economic

23
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:04,009
machine. But in and of itself, it can't produce
anything. It's used to acquire the productive

24
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,389
resources that can produce goods and services.
This confusion is understandable, since most

25
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,579
media refers to financial capital or investment
capital, so it does refer to money. But what

26
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,180
is economic capital? By definition, economic
capital is anything that's manufactured in

27
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,040
order to be used in the production of goods
and services. Well, more simply, capital is

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,040
machinery and equipment. This includes factory
machinery, but also the factory itself, and

29
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,670
computers, furnishings, books, roads, phone
lines, etc.

30
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,670
The last major resource category is entrepreneurial
ability. What, or rather who is an entrepreneur?

31
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,750
An entrepreneur is someone who, first of all,
is able to recognize a profit opportunity.

32
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,969
Second, is able to organize the other factors
of production- another phrase for resources.

33
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:05,150
And third, is willing to accept risk. Look,
do you know who Joe Johnston is? In the late

34
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,620
1980s he and his partner left their engineering
jobs and opened up a coffee shop in downtown

35
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,620
Tempe. Now what you have to realize is that,
at that time, the downtown area was, well,

36
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,610
shall we say, a little less than desirable.
It was just prior to the revitalization and

37
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,040
renovation of that area. And, believe it or
not, no one had ever heard of a little place

38
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,750
called Starbucks, so quite frankly, I'm sure
that people thought that these two guys were

39
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,510
nuts -- bad location, bad product. Whoever
heard of making a living selling coffee in

40
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,828
the desert? Bad idea. Well, Joe and his partner
took the chance, opened that first Coffee

41
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:42,790
Plantation and it was a hit. Within a few
years they sold it off for millions. These

42
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,969
two guys saw a profit opportunity -- there's
50,000+ caffeine-starved students less than

43
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:53,849
two miles away! Come on! They took the risk
and organized the resources to start that

44
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,469
business and make it successful. After selling
the Coffee Plantation, Joe went on to other

45
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:04,319
ventures: Joe's Barbecue, Joe's Farm Grill
and, most recently, Liberty Market. That's

46
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,849
entrepreneurial ability, folks!

47
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,030
NEXT TIME: Micro versus Macro.
