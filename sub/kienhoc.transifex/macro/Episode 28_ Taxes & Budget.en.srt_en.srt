In the US, the government has three primary
sources of tax revenue: 1) personal income

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,169
tax which, as you can see from this pie chart,
accounts for the lion’s share of the federal

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:15,769
government's revenue; 2) corporate income
tax, typically around 10% the overall tax

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:22,170
receipts in the US; and 3) Social Security
tax, or payroll tax. Together, these three

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,089
categories make up nearly all of the federal
government’s tax revenue. The small portion

6
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,540
that's left includes sources like gas tax,
taxes on traded goods, or estate taxes.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:39,540
In fiscal year 2007, this meant that the federal
income was $2.568 trillion. On the flip side,

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,160
federal expenditures in fiscal 2007 were $2.730
trillion. What does the government spend our

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,099
tax dollars on? Well, remember that the government
provides many, many services, but here are

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,740
the larger spending categories based on IRS
data for 2007:

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,790
Social Security, Medicare and other retirement
account for 38% of overall spending. National

12
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:09,789
defense, veterans, and foreign affairs, 23%;
physical, human and community development,

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:16,820
9%; social programs, 19%; law enforcement
and general government, 2%; and net interest

14
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,970
on the debt, 9%. If you’d like a little
more information about what's included in

15
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:28,408
each of these categories. I got this data
from the IRS 1040 form so you can always look

16
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,820
it up on the Internet -- they have a lot of
explanation about what goes in what category.

17
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,499
Based on the 2007 data, I can see that the
government is actually spending $.162 trillion

18
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:45,220
-- that's $162 billion -- more than the tax
revenues that it's bringing in. This overspending

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,450
in a single year is the budget deficit. The
sum of all the deficits and surpluses we've

20
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,590
ever run – yes, we have had surpluses, the
most recent being very briefly in 1969, then

21
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:03,590
again for a few years from 1997 to 2001 – is
the national debt. In 2007, the debt was sufficiently

22
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,199
large that just the interest payment accounted
for 9% of the $2.73 trillion in government

23
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,048
spending; or, the interest payment was $245.7
billion.

24
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:20,299
There are recurring debates as to whether
we should revisit our tax system and simplify

25
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:25,450
with a flat tax. So that you can think about
this, let me explain the three types of income

26
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,450
tax structures, 1) progressive tax, 2) proportional,
or flat, tax and 3) regressive tax.

27
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:39,040
The first type, the progressive tax, is the
system that we have now, where the tax rate

28
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,298
rises as a person's taxable income rises.
The reasoning behind this system is that the

29
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,419
wealthier will bear a larger share of the
tax burden, and the poor will bear a smaller

30
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,349
share.

31
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:54,980
The second type of tax system, the proportional,
or flat, tax, applies the same tax rate to

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,999
all income levels. So for example, a person
making $10,000 would pay $1000 under a 10%

33
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:07,319
flat tax, whereas a person making $100,000
would pay $10,000 in taxes. Many people feel

34
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,290
that this would be a much fairer, and simpler,
way for us to run our tax system. The typical

35
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,168
argument against this system is that the money
actually means more to someone living below

36
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:23,959
the poverty level; the poorer taxpayer has
only $9000 to live on, but the wealthier taxpayer

37
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,309
still has $90,000.

38
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:31,760
The third type is a regressive tax, where
the tax rate decreases the more money you

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,840
make. Who would ever use a system like that?
Well, in fact our sales taxes take a bigger

40
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,159
bite out of the poor, who spend all of their
income (and therefore get taxed on all of

41
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,209
their income) than from the wealthy, who pay
sales tax out of a portion that they spend,

42
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,699
but not on the portion that they save or invest.
This is why many states will not have sales

43
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,040
tax on essential items like food.

44
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,809
Now that you know something about the different
tax structures, you can decide: which type

45
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:02,230
of tax would you prefer?
