So now you know that graphs can be used to
illustrate an individual's choices. What about

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:15,260
the choices facing a society? Well, who makes
decisions on behalf of society? The government.

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:22,790
What kinds of things does our government provide
for us? [pause] Well, they provide things

4
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:31,359
like roads, education, national defense, our
justice system, research, unemployment benefits

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,940
-- the government’s trying to do an awful
lot of things for us all the time. In a sense

6
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,010
the government is just like us -- they're
trying to fulfill THIS many needs, with this

7
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,730
many resources.

8
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,209
So, how do I tell this story using a graph?
First, I want to narrow down the categories

9
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,930
of things that the government tries to provide
to two. Why only two? Oh yeah -- I can only

10
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,930
draw two. OK, let's say that our society has
two categories of goods and services: military

11
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,210
(things like national defense and antiterrorism
programs, etc.) and civilian (which might

12
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,919
include roads, parks, or low income support).
You, as the economic analyst, have no say

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,159
in what the society should do with its resources,
but you can examine what we could do.

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,159
If society takes every bit of its resources
-- ALL the land, ALL the labor, ALL the capital,

15
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,020
and ALL the entrepreneurial ability -- and
puts it into the production of military goods

16
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,780
and services, let’s say that we can produce
5000 units of military output. But this leaves

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,529
NO resources to produce civilian goods, so
we would have ZERO units of civilian output.

18
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:50,310
Note that I'm not making any judgment as to
whether this is a good idea or bad idea; just

19
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,509
that it’s a possible choice that can be
made.

20
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,149
What if you want to consider having some roads,
or schools, or parks? Let's say that you're

21
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,849
considering building 1000 units of civilian
goods – maybe 1000 schools, or 1000 miles

22
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:10,848
of road – where will the resources to produce
1000 units of civilian goods come from? [pause]

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,649
That's right -- you would have to take the
resources away from military production. So

24
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,380
military MUST decrease, let's say, to 4800
units.

25
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,829
What's that? You think I’ve made some kind
of a mistake? How could I possibly gain 1000

26
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,040
units of civilian goods, and only sacrifice
(or have an opportunity cost of) 200 units

27
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,489
of military goods? Well, consider this: what
if “civilian” represents elementary schools,

28
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:49,220
and “military” is stealth bombers? Which
one do you think takes up more resources?

29
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,390
There's no reason why there would have to
be a one-for-one trade off. In fact, it would

30
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,010
be unrealistic and restrictive to assume this.

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:03,899
OK; so what if I want more civilian goods
-- 2000 schools, or 2000 miles of road -- then

32
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,760
what? Yup -- we would have to shift more resources
away from military production, so that now

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,149
civilian is 2000, but military is only 4500.

34
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,180
This time you're sure I’ve made a mistake?
How could I have sacrificed only 200 military

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,620
initially, but now I'm giving up 300 military?
No mistake; instead of constant opportunity

36
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,740
cost, as we had with the grades example, we
now have increasing opportunity cost, where

37
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,370
our sacrifice will just keep getting bigger
and bigger. A PPC that shows increasing opportunity

38
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,540
cost is actually much more representative
of how the world works. It happens when resources

39
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,090
are not as perfectly well-suited for one type
of production as the other. I’ll come back

40
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,740
to this in another video segment. Following
this pattern of increasing opportunity cost,

41
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,430
let's complete the table.

42
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:05,430
To get 3000 civilian goods, you drop to 4000
military; to get 4000 civilian, you drop to

43
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,150
three 3300 military; to get 5000 civilian,
you drop to 2000 military, and if you used

44
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,539
every bit of society's resources for civilian
output, you’ll have 6000 units of civilian

45
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:24,240
goods, but not have any resources left for
military production. Again, as the economic

46
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,740
analyst, it isn't your job to decide which
of these combinations is good or bad.

47
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,740
So who does get to decide? [pause] That's
right -- the government. Let's say that you’re

48
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,299
not only an economic analyst, but you're also
presenting your data to the White House. Visuals

49
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,960
are good so take a few minutes now to pause
this video, and map out the combinations -- with

50
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,960
the military on the vertical axis, and civilian
on a horizontal. [pause]

51
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,690
Hopefully yours look something like this.
Again, it illustrates the inverse relationship

52
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,900
between military and civilian production;
the bowed-out shape shows the increasing opportunity

53
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,870
cost. You bring the charts and figures and
explain to the president, “Mr. (or Mrs.)

54
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,180
President, this is the production possibilities
curve -- sometimes referred to as the production

55
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,030
possibilities frontier, since it shows the
outer limit of what can be produced with our

56
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:31,030
current resources.” What point will the
President pick? [pause] Right again - it depends.

57
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:40,050
Depends on what? Well, it could be any number
of factors: political ideology could determine

58
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,990
where the president would pick. Your typical,
or average, Republican, if there is such a

59
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,680
thing, tends to lean more toward military
– this is classic “Reagan” behavior.

60
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,460
Democrats are often viewed as the “spenders,”
more on social programs, closer to the civilian

61
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,620
axis. Could be world events; in the early
1990s, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and

62
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,620
the Soviet Union, we moved away from military
axis. But after 9/11, we moved toward the

63
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,730
military axis.

64
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:15,730
So the President thinks it over carefully,
and finally says, “I choose… point H.”

65
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,740
What do you tell the president? [pause] Hopefully,
you're making your response respectful, because,

66
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,120
after all, this is the president, so how about
something like, “Oh, I'm sorry Mr. (or Mrs.)

67
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,949
President – but perhaps I’ve miscommunicated
something to you. This line -- the production

68
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:40,190
possibilities curve -- represents the outer
boundary of what we can produce right now,

69
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,590
even if we used all of the available resources.”

70
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,900
To which the present responds, “Ah yes,
you did make a mistake – but I see now.

71
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,900
I choose Point… I.” What do you tell the
president? [pause] ”Well, Mr. (or Mrs.)

72
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,560
President, you certainly COULD choose Point
I, but then we would have resources going

73
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,500
to waste.” In particular, you might point
out that unused resources are UNEMPLOYED resources.

74
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,960
More specifically, unemployed labor makes
for unhappy voters -- that usually works with

75
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,630
politicians. The point is that while you,
the economic analyst, do the positive analysis,

76
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:26,969
ultimately, the government decides where we
should produce -- the normative analysis.

77
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,940
You demonstrate the possible outcomes, and
it's up to the policymakers to make the final

78
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,190
choice.

79
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,210

the PPC.
