Now, what were the three macroeconomic goals
again? There was 1) stable prices, 2) low

2
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:14,700
unemployment, and 3) high and sustained economic
growth. We now know that the third goal refers

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,698
to the high and sustained growth of a country's
income -- its GDP; more specifically, the

4
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,849
growth of its real GDP, which controls for
any price changes. We want to be sure to look

5
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:32,180
at real rather than nominal GDP, because the
nominal GDP may increase, in whole or in part,

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,870
due to rising prices rather than rising output
or productivity.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,050
Economic growth, then, is defined as increases
in the real GDP. How do we know if real GDP

8
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,530
is growing? Percentage change in real GDP,
just like percentage change in price or percentage

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:55,530
change in income, which we've seen before,
is real GDP new, minus real GDP old, all over

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,210
the old real GDP, times 100 to get it in percentage
terms.

11
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,030
If the percentage change in real GDP is greater
than zero, the economy is growing. If the

12
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,020
percentage change in real GDP is less than
zero, the economy is shrinking. How we classify

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,460
a decline in the economy is a question of
duration. If the real GDP declines for two

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,939
consecutive quarters (that's six months),
we have a recession; if real GDP declines

15
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:27,850
for eight consecutive quarters (two years),
we have a depression.
