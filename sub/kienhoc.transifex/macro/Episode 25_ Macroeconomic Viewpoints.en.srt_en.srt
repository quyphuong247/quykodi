I'm going to share something with you that
I don’t tell just anyone: When I first took

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:11,190
macroeconomics, I HATED it. No, really. Look,
here's an example why: I come to class on

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,498
Monday and scribble furiously as the professor
lectured. “Today we’re doing aggregate

4
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:21,430
supply, a relationship between the price level
and the GDP.” Wednesday, I come to class,

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,700
and scribble furiously. “Today, we’re
talking about the aggregate supply, a relationship

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,040
between the price level and the GDP.” Then
Friday, I show up and scribble some more.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,910
“Today we’re talking about aggregate supply,
a relationship between price level and the

8
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,599
GDP.” Exam time comes around, I pull out
my notes to study, and this is what I see.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,260
Will the real aggregate supply please stand
up? Which version is correct? What I came

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,540
to learn later in my academic career is that
each of these views has been correct at some

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,879
point in time. After all, what is the model
supposed to do? It’s supposed to help me

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,539
observe, understand, and make predictions
about economic behavior. At different points

13
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:08,999
in time, if you looked out your window at
the economy, you would've seen one of these

14
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:11,850
three versions of the aggregate supply.

15
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,439
Let's go back to late 1800s which, interestingly
enough, looked a lot like the late 1900s.

16
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,270
The economy was operating at full capacity:
factories in use, fully employed labor, production

17
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,539
humming along. When this is the case, that
the economy is at full capacity, or full employment,

18
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:33,249
the society is at its potential GDP. Even
if demand should rise, there aren't any more

19
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:38,208
resources, so you wouldn’t be able to get
any more output -- just inflation. This is

20
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:43,810
why the classical model depicts the aggregate
supply as a vertical line at potential (or

21
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,139
full employment) GDP.

22
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:50,209
The classical model fell out of favor when
it no longer accurately described economic

23
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:55,539
behavior, namely, during the Great Depression.
John Maynard Keynes came along and observed

24
00:01:55,539 --> 00:02:01,560
that clearly, with unemployment 25% or higher
for a sustained period, we were not operating

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,160
at our potential. In fact, Keynes argued that
we had so much unused capacity, and so many

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,629
unused resources, that if aggregate demand
were to increase, we could increase GDP without

27
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:19,709
seeing any inflation whatsoever. The Keynesian
model of aggregate supply is horizontal.

28
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,870
Of course, for the most part, we see that
increased GDP is accompanied by some inflation.

29
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,969
This is the intermediate model of aggregate
supply. Which one is correct, Keynesian, intermediate,

30
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:36,459
or classical? Well, as I said, at some point
in time, each of these viewpoints has been

31
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:43,459
correct. Really they're all smaller pieces
of larger picture. At very low levels of GDP,

32
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,219
where there a lot of unused resources, we
see the Keynesian model. At full employment,

33
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:53,659
where we’re operating at full potential,
we see the classical portion. And in the middle,

34
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,659
where responding to increased aggregate demand
means an increase in GDP and an increase in

35
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:04,129
prices, we’re in the intermediate range.
Over the years, as one model falls into disfavor,

36
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:09,010
and another takes its place, invariably some
academic who liked the old model will come

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,390
up with a new, more updated version to make
the old model more attractive; hence new classical

38
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,108
economists and new Keynesian economists.

39
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:23,200
Take original classical model, for example.
In the original version, the economy was always

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,280
at its potential Well of course you don't
have to wait long to show that this is not

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,249
the way the world behaves. Sometimes we’re
at full employment, but often we’re not.

42
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:37,090
Since it did not accurately describe the way
the economy worked, the classical model fell

43
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,909
out of favor. Sometime later, however, the
new classical model emerged: “OK, so we’re

44
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:47,819
not always our potential, but when we're not
at that level, it’s only for short time

45
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,129
periods because economy self-adjusts over
time to get back to its full-employment level.”

46
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,590
The story goes something like this: What if
we aren't operating and natural Real GDP,

47
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,590
i.e., the full employment level, or our potential?
If our macroeconomic equilibrium is Q*, and

48
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,180
Q* falls short of our potential, then Q* is
less than the natural real GDP, and we have

49
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,860
what's called a recessionary gap. What this
means is that right now, at Q*, our actual

50
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,100
unemployment level is higher than the natural
rate of unemployment. So we currently have

51
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,350
a surplus of labor standing around. In a free
market for anything, even if that “thing”

52
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,730
is labor, a surplus will correct itself as
price falls. In this case, the price of labor,

53
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:41,770
or the wage, falls. As labor gets cheaper,
employers hire more labor, and aggregate supply

54
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,500
shifts to the right. How far? Well, until
the labor surplus disappears; that is, until

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,020
we are at full employment, or at our potential
GDP. The weak spot in this argument is the

56
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,310
flexibility of wages. Will wages fall as a
consequence of higher unemployment? If not,

57
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,990
the aggregate supply never adjusts.

58
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,990
And what if Q*, our equilibrium, or actual
GDP, is greater than potential GDP? This is

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,420
referred to as an inflationary gap. Remember,
full employment level isn't actually zero

60
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,770
unemployment, so it is possible to dip below
this level. If our macroeconomic equilibrium

61
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:26,770
GDP is Q*, and Q* is higher than our potential,
then Q* is greater than the natural real GDP.

62
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,820
What this means is that right now, at Q*,
the actual unemployment rate is lower than

63
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,560
the natural rate of unemployment (also known
as the full employment rate), so that we currently

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,440
have a labor shortage. Any shortage in a free
market will correct itself via rising prices,

65
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,840
so the price of labor (or wage) will increase.
As labor gets more expensive, the aggregate

66
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,570
supply falls. How much will it shift? Aggregate
supply will stop moving when there is no longer

67
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:04,570
a labor shortage; that is, when the macroeconomic
equilibrium is at our potential. TIME TO THINK:

68
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,340
for the self-adjusting model to work, wages
and prices have to be flexible. Are wages

69
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,880
completely free to increase? Are they completely
free to decrease?

70
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,830
The reason that I bring up the different schools
of economic thought -- Keynesian and Classical

71
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:27,409
-- is that they have a direct impact on economic
policy recommendations. For example, suppose

72
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,150
the economy is in a recessionary gap in you’re
a Classical, or New Classical, economist -- you

73
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,340
believe that the economy can fix itself. What
role do you recommend for the government?

74
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,400
Should it be active and try to help the economy
along, or just leave things alone? Now, what

75
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,120
if you're a Keynesian, or a New Keynesian
economist? You do not believe that the economy

76
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,120
will self-adjust. If there's a recessionary
gap, the economy will remain stuck in a recessionary

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,000
gap. What role do you recommend for the government:
hands-on, or non-interventionist?
