The law of demand states: more of good will
be bought the lower its price, less will be

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:11,280
bought the higher its price, ceteris paribus.
Well, what does it MEAN? All the law of demand

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,530
really says is that there is an inverse relationship
between price and the quantity demanded. Price

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,520
goes up, amount bought goes down. At a low
price, people are much more willing to buy;

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,270
at a high price, people don't want buy much.

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,119
What about that last part, the Latin -- ceteris
paribus? Well, ceteris paribus means “all

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,340
else being equal,” or “other things the
same.” So the law of demand says that there

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,280
will be an inverse relationship between price
and quantity demanded, as long as nothing

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,010
else changes.

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,010
Look at it this way: if you are a consumer,
what makes you willing to buy (or not willing

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,680
to buy) a product or service? Of course price
affects your willingness or unwillingness

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,790
to purchase, but what else? Income? Sure,
the amount of income, particularly your disposable

13
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:05,789
income, will affect your willingness and/or
ability to buy. Luxury or necessity? Absolutely.

14
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,850
What about differing tastes and preferences?
Naturally, your tastes and preferences help

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,220
to determine your willingness or unwillingness
to purchase, but what determines your tastes

16
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,060
and preferences? Of course your personal tastes
and preferences have been a lifetime in the

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,390
making, and are always changing, but a few
determining factors are: age, gender, religion,

18
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,860
and social status. What else affects your
willingness to buy? How about… weather,

19
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,700
or climate? What about expectations for the
future? How many factors are there, that affect

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,350
an individual's willingness to buy -- or not?
The number of factors is endless, and I for

21
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,100
one, don't like to think about an infinite
number of things at once.

22
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,809
If I'm going to model the willingness to purchase,
I want to narrow my focus to only two factors.

23
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:59,020
What will the two factors be? Well, think
back to the Law of Demand: the focus is on

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,720
quantity demanded and price. Quantity demanded,
or what you buy, of course depends on all

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,319
the factors just mentioned. Quantity demanded
is a function of: price of the product, price

26
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,569
of substitute products, price of complementary
goods, it depends on the income, it depends

27
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:23,488
on the weather, politics… all this stuff!
But if I were to focus just on quantity demanded

28
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,840
and price, what do I do with everything else?
Well, remember that “all else constant”

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,760
part? We recognize that all of these other
factors are important to the decision, but

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,679
for right now, we’ll assume that they’re
constant, and unchanging. How does this work?

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,830
Well, imagine that you are in the market to
buy a house. You consider a lot of variables,

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,209
right? Your income, mortgage rates, which
neighborhoods have good schools and other

33
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,410
amenities. Is this just a starter home, or
will you be there for a long time? And of

34
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,690
course you will look it home pricing. Suppose
you’ve already given thought to your budget,

35
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,310
mortgage rates, neighborhood amenities, whether
a Walmart is being built nearby, etc., and

36
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:11,310
you also find that right now, housing is going
for $150 a square foot. At this price, and

37
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,330
given all those other factors, you have determined
that you would be willing to purchase a 1500

38
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,269
ft.? house. What the market slows down, and
price per square foot drops to $100? Keep

39
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,739
in mind that all the other variables will
be unchanged -- same income, same mortgage

40
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,420
rates, same neighborhood amenities, same everything
-- except that the price per square-foot has

41
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,809
changed. The Law of Demand says that you would
then be willing to purchase more square footage

42
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,090
(well, wouldn’t you…?), perhaps 2000 ft.?.

43
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:51,090
What if the market headed up again such the
price per square foot increases to $200. All

44
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:57,048
else constant, you would not be willing, or
able, to buy as much house as before -- maybe

45
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:03,340
at $200 per square foot, everything else remaining
the same, the quantity demanded will be more

46
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,340
like 1000 ft.?. In the end if you were to
plot out each of these price-quantity combinations,

47
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,980
you would start to see the inverse relationship
described by the Law of Demand. Now of course

48
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,719
there are more possible prices than just these
three, but we can see the general pattern

49
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,449
now, and other prices would fit in with that
existing pattern.

50
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:30,849
Do you notice that these points are starting
to trace out a line? Well, this line – really,

51
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:37,849
this collection of all possible price-quantity
demanded combinations -- is the demand curve.

52
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:40,949
NEXT TIME: Change in demand versus change
in quantity demanded
