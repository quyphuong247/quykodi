Professor Paul Bloom:
Two follow-ups on

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
yesterday's--I'm sorry,
on Monday's lecture.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,140
One is that somebody came up
after class and asked when the

4
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:24,667
preference for your own language
emerges in development and

5
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:30,195
fortunately,
studies pretty much exactly

6
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:33,422
this sort of infant
understanding.

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:35,630
She knew the answer.
There's been studies looking at

8
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:38,919
newborn babies finding that
pretty much the moment they pop

9
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:42,848
out they favor their own
language over other

10
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:45,761
language--over other languages.
And this suggests that they are

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:49,970
listening while in utero,
while in the womb,

12
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:52,425
to the rhythms of their
language and developing a

13
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:55,166
preference for it.
A second issue is,

14
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:57,936
I talked very briefly about a
court case in which the person

15
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:02,712
was--said at a moment where
someone else was pointing a gun

16
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:07,406
at a police officer,
"Let him have it!"

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:10,640
and a police officer was killed.
And that person was charged

18
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:14,284
with murder but I admitted I
didn't actually know how things

19
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:17,747
turned out and was kind enough
to do extensive research.

20
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:21,209
Well, he went to Wikipedia and
[laughter]

21
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:24,517
found out the answer.
The answer is he was tried and

22
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:28,667
found guilty for murder.
He was then subsequently

23
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:33,137
pardoned.
In fact, he was pardoned in

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:36,970
1988, which is really nice
except he was executed in 1957.

25
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:42,980
But they did it into a movie.
So, it's a movie.

26
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,270
Okay.
So, I want to do today,

27
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:49,789
for the first part of the
lecture, is continue the

28
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:52,194
language lecture and then move
to perception,

29
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:54,354
attention, and memory.
And what we had spoken about

30
00:01:57,675 --> 00:01:57,675
was--We first talked about
universals of language,

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,310
then moved to some detail about
the different aspects of

32
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:05,575
language including phonology,
morphology, and syntax.

33
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:09,780
We discussed the ways in which
language does the amazing things

34
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:13,982
it does, including the fact that
language has used arbitrary

35
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:17,981
science or sounds to convey
concepts,

36
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:20,759
and that languages exploit a
combinatorial system including

37
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:25,104
recursion to put together these
symbols into a virtually

38
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:29,224
limitless set of meaningful
sentences.

39
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:32,370
We then talked about
development and made some

40
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:35,219
remarks about the developmental
time course – talking about

41
00:02:39,18 --> 00:02:39,18
the emergence of language from
babies to – where babies are

42
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:42,817
really good at learning language
to you who are not,

43
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:46,490
whose brains have atrophied,
whose language capacities are

44
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:52,973
dead.
Final issue is to shift to

45
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:55,723
animals.
Now that we know something

46
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:58,625
about language,
we could then ask do animals

47
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:02,305
use--possess the same sort of
language?

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:05,900
And if not, can they learn it?
Now, there is absolutely no

49
00:03:09,50 --> 00:03:09,50
doubt at all that nonhuman
animals possess communication

50
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:12,758
systems.
This has been known forever and

51
00:03:16,53 --> 00:03:16,53
is not a matter of controversy.
And if you want to use the term

52
00:03:20,59 --> 00:03:20,59
"language" to mean
"communication," then the answer

53
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:22,268
is obviously "yes."
Dogs and bees and monkeys have

54
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:25,384
language.
If you want to use language

55
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:28,245
though in the more technical,
narrow sense as anything that

56
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:32,855
has the properties that we
discussed earlier,

57
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:36,669
using English and ASL and
Spanish and so on as our

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:39,780
background, the answer's almost
certainly "no."

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:42,889
Animal communication systems
fall into sort of one of three

60
00:03:47,23 --> 00:03:47,23
categories.
Either there is a finite list

61
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:49,853
of calls, so vervet monkeys,
for instance,

62
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:52,543
have a small list of calls to
convey different warnings like

63
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:56,416
"attack from a snake" or "attack
from a leopard."

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960
There is a continuous analog
signal.

65
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:02,460
So, bee dance,
for instance,

66
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:04,298
works on this way.
Bee dance communicates the

67
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:06,984
location of food sources but
doesn't do it in any

68
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,429
syntactically structured way.
Rather, the intensity of the

69
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:12,538
dance corresponds to the
richness of the food source.

70
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:15,389
And then, you get things like
random variation on a theme such

71
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:19,212
as birdsong.
But what you don't find in any

72
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:22,502
real sense is phonology,
morphology, syntax,

73
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:25,961
combinatorial systems or
arbitrary names.

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Now, this much is not
particularly controversial.

75
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:32,660
There gets to be a lot of
controversy though.

76
00:04:35,89 --> 00:04:35,89
This is the summary about
nonhuman communication systems.

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:37,560
It gets more controversial when
we get to famous cases of

78
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:42,995
primates trained by humans such
as Kanzi,

79
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,170
Nim Chimpsky,
and other famous primates that

80
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:50,570
you may well have seen on the
Discovery channel and other

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
venues.
And this is fairly

82
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:56,933
controversial.
If you read the Gray textbook,

83
00:05:00,35 --> 00:05:00,35
while nothing in it is
particularly inaccurate,

84
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:03,579
I think Gray is actually a
little bit too credulous,

85
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:06,628
too believing in the claims
that have been made about the

86
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:09,976
abilities of the animals.
So many scientists argue,

87
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:13,658
for instance,
that animals like Kanzi,

88
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:16,543
even if they can be said to be
learning words at all,

89
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:20,597
learn very few of them.
And it takes them extensive

90
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,870
years of training to learn,
unlike a normally developing

91
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:29,129
child who could learn a word in
a day or a word in an hour.

92
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:33,930
The utterances often have order
but this order tends to be very

93
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:38,594
limited and lacks the recursive
properties.

94
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:41,980
And in fact,
the lack of recursion is not

95
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:44,794
controversial.
Finally, the utterances of

96
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:48,343
chimpanzees--trained chimpanzees
are extremely repetitive so what

97
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:54,308
you often see on TV and in
documentaries is sort of a

98
00:05:59,155 --> 00:05:59,155
sampling.
And the sampling could often be

99
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:02,353
very impressive but if you take
just what they say at random it

100
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,140
tends to look like this.
This is typical chimpanzee

101
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:09,526
utterances just taken at random:
"Nim eat, Nim eat.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Drink, eat, me Nim.
Me gum, me gum.

103
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Tickle me, Nim play.
Me eat, me eat.

104
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:20,139
Me banana, you banana,
me you give.

105
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Banana me, me eat.
Give orange,

106
00:06:26,3 --> 00:06:26,3
me give, eat orange,
me eat orange."

107
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,189
Lila Gleitman once commented
that if any normally developing

108
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:33,995
child spoke like this,
his parents would rush him

109
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:37,905
screaming to a neurologist.
There's a broader question

110
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:42,283
here, which is,
"Why would we ever expect a

111
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:45,277
chimpanzee to learn a human
language?"

112
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:48,199
We don't normally expect one
species to have the capacities

113
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:52,638
associated with another species.
So, bats use echolocation to

114
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:57,363
get around and some birds
navigate by the stars,

115
00:07:01,79 --> 00:07:01,79
but there's not an active
research program seeing if cats

116
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:04,337
can use echolocation or dogs
could navigate by the stars.

117
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:07,769
And I think one reason why you
might be tempted to think,

118
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:10,795
"well, of course chimps must be
able to learn language" is

119
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:13,875
because you might be caught in
the grips of some bad ideas

120
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:16,955
about language.
So, one idea is you might say,

121
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:20,311
"Look.
Chimps should use language

122
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:22,139
because chimps are so smart."
But the response to this is,

123
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:26,521
"they are smart but we know
that smart isn't enough."

124
00:07:32,60 --> 00:07:32,60
We know that the human capacity
for language is not totally a

125
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:35,901
result of smartness.
There are smart children who,

126
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:38,906
due to some deficit in their
language capacity,

127
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:41,438
don't speak or understand a
language.

128
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:43,639
So, the smartness of
chimpanzees does not in itself

129
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:46,439
demonstrate that they should be
able to learn language.

130
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:49,629
You might also point out
correctly that chimps are our

131
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:51,897
nearest evolutionary relatives,
which is right,

132
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:54,549
so you--one would expect on the
face of it--it's not

133
00:07:58,763 --> 00:07:58,763
unreasonable to expect us to
share a lot of abilities with

134
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:03,473
them.
On the other hand,

135
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:05,649
we split from them a long time
ago and plainly humans are

136
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:09,846
different from chimps.
And there was five million

137
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:13,532
years either way and that's more
than enough time for a language

138
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:17,925
capacity to evolve.
Now, none of this is to say

139
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:22,205
that the study of nonhuman
communication systems isn't

140
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:27,594
interesting.
From my own--This is my

141
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:30,794
personal opinion I'll raise
here.

142
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,269
From my own opinion,
the study of the attempts to

143
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:36,456
try to teach chimpanzees,
or gibbons, or gorillas,

144
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:39,708
a human language like ASL are
misguided.

145
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:42,629
It would be as if a team of
monkeys kidnapped a human child

146
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:46,274
and tried to train him how to
hoot like a monkey.

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:49,480
It might be enjoyable but it
does not seem to give us any

148
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:52,552
rich insights.
What I think is a lot more

149
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:54,854
interesting is the study of
these animal communication

150
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:57,759
systems in the wild.
There's a linguistics of human

151
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:00,822
language that has delineated the
principles that underlie all

152
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:04,428
human languages.
It would be as extraordinarily

153
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:07,446
interesting to attempt the same
linguistic program to the other

154
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:11,325
communication systems used in
the wild such as the cries of

155
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:14,953
vervet monkeys and bee dance.
So, this brings the section on

156
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:18,657
language to a close but I want
to tell you a few things we

157
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:21,655
didn't talk about.
One of the problems with an

158
00:09:24,99 --> 00:09:24,99
Intro Psych course is we have to
whip through a lot of topics

159
00:09:27,75 --> 00:09:27,75
very fast.
So, if you were to take a

160
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:29,165
course that focused directly on
language you might learn,

161
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:32,519
for instance,
more about language in the

162
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:34,347
brain, something touched about
very briefly in the textbook but

163
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:37,252
something that has a large
literature associated with it.

164
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,110
Similarly, and related to this,
there's language disorders,

165
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:44,446
disorders like aphasias and
disorders like specific language

166
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:48,856
impairment and dyslexia.
There is the study of language

167
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:52,292
perception and production.
How is it that we do this

168
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:54,943
amazing feat of understanding
and producing words in a

169
00:09:58,4 --> 00:09:58,4
fraction of a second?
Where does that ability come

170
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:01,547
from?
There is the study of reading

171
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:03,815
which is, in many ways,
different from the study of a

172
00:10:07,52 --> 00:10:07,52
language.
Remember when Darwin described

173
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:10,167
language as an instinct.
He carefully distinguished it

174
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:13,753
from other things that don't
come natural to us including

175
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:16,868
reading.
And in fact,

176
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,270
reading is difficult.
Reading is a cultural

177
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:20,788
invention, not every human has
it.

178
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:22,570
And unlike language,
reading is acquired with

179
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:25,346
tremendous difficulty over many
years.

180
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:27,870
On the other hand,
reading plainly intersects with

181
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:30,728
language.
It's a new way of conveying

182
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:32,975
language, moving out from speech
to writing.

183
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:35,649
And the psychology and
neuroscience of reading is thus

184
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,220
very interesting.
There's bilingualism and

185
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:42,244
multilingualism.
The questions people in this

186
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:45,602
room typically are going to be
interested in is does it matter

187
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:50,225
for how well you learn language
whether you're learning one or

188
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:54,849
two or three or four.
How is it that a multilingual

189
00:10:58,837 --> 00:10:58,837
encodes all these different
languages inside a single brain?

190
00:11:03,80 --> 00:11:03,80
And so on.
Finally, a very hot issue is

191
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:07,878
that of the relationship between
language and thought and I'm

192
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:12,224
actually--A few years ago I
taught an entire seminar called

193
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:16,426
"Language and Thought" devoted
to precisely this question.

194
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:20,990
And it's a cool question and it
could break up into two very

195
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:24,425
general questions.
One is, "Is language necessary

196
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:27,333
for abstract thought?"
And one way to answer that

197
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:30,361
question is to look at creatures
without language like babies and

198
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:34,526
chimpanzees and see how smart
they are.

199
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:37,259
It might be that they're
not--that they're very smart,

200
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:39,541
in which case it would suggest
you don't need language for

201
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:41,995
abstract thought.
On the other hand,

202
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:43,787
it might be that they have
certain cognitive limitations,

203
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:46,548
which would suggest that
language is essential for

204
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:48,965
abstract thought.
Then there's the related

205
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:51,624
question.
Even once you know a language,

206
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:53,954
does the structural properties
of the language that you know

207
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:57,247
affect the way you think?
And the claim that the language

208
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:00,702
you know affects how you think
is sometimes described as

209
00:12:04,61 --> 00:12:04,61
linguistic relativity or the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

210
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:07,419
So for instance,
there's a lot of research

211
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:09,741
looking at speakers of different
languages such as English versus

212
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:13,364
Korean and seeing whether
structural differences in these

213
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:16,535
languages affect how you think.
Now, some of this work is

214
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:19,966
discussed in the readings,
the book--the Gray textbook,

215
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:22,960
and the selections from The
Norton Anthology. And this

216
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:26,813
makes up--again,
I've showed this to you on

217
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:29,687
Monday--your reading response
where you have to address this

218
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:33,584
question and take your best shot
at answering it.

219
00:12:37,20 --> 00:12:37,20


220
00:12:40,80 --> 00:12:40,80
What are your questions about
language?

221
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,110


222
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

223
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question was raised,

224
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,360
"Some people learn languages
easier than others and how do we

225
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:09,873
explain this?"
And the answer is you could ask

226
00:13:13,42 --> 00:13:13,42
the question both with regard to
first language learning – so

227
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:17,508
some children learn language
very quickly,

228
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:20,750
some are very slow – and also
with regard to second language

229
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:23,774
learning.
Some of you are breezing

230
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:25,659
through your second language
requirement here at Yale.

231
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:28,730
Others are struggling and
miserable.

232
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:31,809
And there's considerable
variation.

233
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,360
There's the story of Einstein
who was very slow to learn

234
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:37,950
language and didn't speak at all
until he was four.

235
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:41,409
And in fact,
he was a--He said his first

236
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:43,709
words when all of a sudden he
was having supper with his

237
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:46,952
parents and he put down the
spoon and he said,

238
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:49,900
"The soup is too hot."
And his parents stared in

239
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:54,182
astonishment and said,
"You've never spoken before."

240
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:56,860
And he said,
"Well, up to now everything's

241
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:01,658
been fine."
[laughter]

242
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:04,204
It's not a true story.
[laughter]

243
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:07,285
The question of why and where
these differences come from,

244
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:11,421
nobody really knows and it's
surprisingly hard.

245
00:14:15,49 --> 00:14:15,49
There's a slight advantage for
being female.

246
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,340
Girls are slightly more
advanced in language than boys

247
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:21,403
but it's not a big one and you
need a hundred people to just

248
00:14:24,814 --> 00:14:24,814
see it statistically.
There's a big genetic factor.

249
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,250
If your parents learned
language quickly and learned

250
00:14:32,32 --> 00:14:32,32
other languages quickly,
you are more likely to.

251
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:34,759
But an understanding of the
brain bases of these differences

252
00:14:39,99 --> 00:14:39,99
or the cognitive bases or the
social bases is just--is largely

253
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:43,585
an open question.
Yes.

254
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:46,450
Student: What happens
when parents [inaudible]

255
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:50,123
Professor Paul Bloom:
This is actually more the norm

256
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:54,221
around the world than the
situation in the United States

257
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:58,107
where kids are exposed to a
single language.

258
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:01,639
What happens is children learn
both languages.

259
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:05,429
Children are very good,
as adults are,

260
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:07,415
of distinguishing different
languages on the basis of their

261
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:10,527
sound system and their rhythms
so they don't typically confuse

262
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:13,799
them.
And then they just learn more

263
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:15,713
than one language.
And that's actually more the

264
00:15:19,1 --> 00:15:19,1
average state of affairs around
the world.

265
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Yes.
Student: You said that

266
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:27,162
people who are right-handed
learn languages [inaudible]

267
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,380
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question is about the

268
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:37,501
hemispheric specialization for
language.

269
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:41,850
And I don't have actually much
more to say than what I said

270
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:44,954
before, which I agree is deeply
unsatisfying.

271
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:47,470
If you're right-handed,
language is probably in the

272
00:15:50,62 --> 00:15:50,62
left side of your brain.
How many people here are

273
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:53,803
left-handed?
For you we don't know.

274
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:56,890
It varies.
Some of you have it in the left

275
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,120
side.
Some of you have it in the

276
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:01,314
right side.
For some of you it's kind of

277
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:03,596
diffuse.
Now, why is this?

278
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:06,409
And in fact,
why are some people

279
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:08,305
right-handed and others
left-handed in the first place?

280
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:11,790
Those are really good questions.
Yes.

281
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:16,730
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

282
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:28,460
Yes.
I'll--Yes, that's--I'll answer

283
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:32,253
that question.
And unfortunately,

284
00:16:34,232 --> 00:16:34,232
it's going to be the last one
and then I'll go to vision.

285
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:36,559
The question is,
"Does learning more than one

286
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:38,885
language cause you to learn them
slower than just learning one

287
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,110
language?"
And it would stand to reason

288
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:44,145
that it would.
There's a finite amount of

289
00:16:46,57 --> 00:16:46,57
mental resources.
If I'm just learning English,

290
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:48,394
I use all of it for English.
And if I'm learning English and

291
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:51,730
Spanish I kind of got to split.
And you'd expect them to be

292
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:54,963
each learned slower.
It's one of the surprises of

293
00:16:57,782 --> 00:16:57,782
the study of language
development that that

294
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:00,455
common-sense view does not
appear to be true.

295
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,509
Children learning more than one
language seem to show no deficit

296
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:08,327
relative--in each of their
languages, relative to a child

297
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:12,608
learning just one language.
In other words,

298
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:15,742
if I am just learning English
and I'm a kid and you're

299
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:18,438
learning English and Spanish and
you're a kid,

300
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:20,930
you'll reach the milestones in
English the same time I will.

301
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:25,539
Your extra learning of Spanish
doesn't seem to affect you.

302
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,630
There doesn't seem to be any
detriment for learning multiple

303
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:32,469
languages.
Another question which comes up

304
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:35,451
is, "Is there any cognitive
deficit?"

305
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,150
In other words,
some people have argued that

306
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:40,149
learning multiple languages
sometimes harms children in

307
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:42,659
certain ways.
This is a claim that's been

308
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:44,884
made in Quebec,
for instance,

309
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:46,371
over the debate over how
children should be taught

310
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:48,974
English and French.
It does not appear to be the

311
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:51,814
case.
There appears to be,

312
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:53,717
as far as we know,
no down side to learning many

313
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,400
languages when you're young.
Does that answer your question?

314
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,630


315
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I want to move now to the topic
that will take us through today

316
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:11,546
and through the beginning of
next week – perception,

317
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:15,433
attention, and memory.
And I'm putting them together

318
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:19,321
instead of treating them as
separate lectures because

319
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:22,875
there's a sense in which they're
the same story.

320
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,360
You see a scene.
You see this scene and you're

321
00:18:30,398 --> 00:18:30,398
looking at it and you're
perceiving it.

322
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:32,920
It's coming through your eyes
and you're interpreting it and

323
00:18:35,743 --> 00:18:35,743
you see something.
You see a man and you see a

324
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,970
house.
If you were to shut your eyes,

325
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,190
you could still hold that scene
in memory.

326
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:42,900
And a week later,
if I'm to ask you about that,

327
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,160
"What season was it?"
you would do pretty well.

328
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:54,690
This is the story I want to
talk about – how we do this.

329
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:58,490
And in the course of this I
want to make a series of claims

330
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:03,281
that go something like this.
For perception,

331
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:06,624
I want to first persuade you
the problem of perception's hard

332
00:19:10,80 --> 00:19:10,80
and that successful perception
involves educated and

333
00:19:13,18 --> 00:19:13,18
unconscious guesses about the
world.

334
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:15,380
For attention,
I want to suggest that we

335
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:17,708
attend to some things and not
others and we miss a surprising

336
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:21,291
amount of what happens in the
world.

337
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:23,680
For memory, there are many
types of memory.

338
00:19:27,39 --> 00:19:27,39
The key to memory is
organization and understanding.

339
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:29,589
And you can't trust some of
your memories.

340
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:33,799
How many of you remember where
you were at 9/11?

341
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Many of you are wrong.
And I am never going to

342
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:43,541
persuade you of this because you
have certain memories.

343
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:48,440
And you could tell the story.
Everybody could tell the story

344
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:51,515
where they were when the towers
went down.

345
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,160
But clever psychologists on
September 12 said,

346
00:19:57,787 --> 00:19:57,787
"Let's do a study."
And they asked people,

347
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:00,657
"Where were you yesterday when
you heard the news?"

348
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:03,440
And they told them.
And then they went back to them

349
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:06,325
later, a year later,
two years later,

350
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:08,573
and said, "Tell me about what
happened September 11."

351
00:20:12,69 --> 00:20:12,69
And they said,
"I remember totally where I

352
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:14,215
was.
I have a very--" And then--And

353
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:16,266
often the story was wrong.
There is a lot like that which

354
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:20,208
we're going to talk about.
And the biggest moral then--so,

355
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:24,879
I put it really,
in really big print--We are

356
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:28,389
often wrong about our
experiences, both of the present

357
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:32,714
and of right now.
So, let's start with perception.

358
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:37,859
There is a story--I went to
graduate school at MIT and there

359
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:41,994
was a story there about Marvin
Minsky who is the A.I.

360
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:45,639
guru.
He--If you've heard the

361
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:47,666
words--the phrase "artificial
intelligence," that was him.

362
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,250
And if you heard the claim that
people are nothing more than

363
00:20:55,94 --> 00:20:55,94
machines made of meat--also him.
Well, there's a story where he

364
00:20:59,102 --> 00:20:59,102
was doing work on robotics and
he was interested in building a

365
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:02,747
robot that could do all sorts of
cool things that's like a robot.

366
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:06,809
And the story goes the robot
had to among--had to write--had

367
00:21:12,44 --> 00:21:12,44
to see the world.
It had to be able to pick up

368
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:15,543
things and recognize people and
see chairs and navigate its way

369
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:19,559
and Minsky said,
"That's a tough problem.

370
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:22,410
It's going to take a graduate
student a whole summer to figure

371
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:25,468
it out."
And he assigned it to a

372
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:27,361
graduate student for a summer
project.

373
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Visual psychologists,
perception psychologists,

374
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:33,476
love that story because the
study of computer vision and

375
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:37,967
robotics vision and the attempts
to make machines that can

376
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:42,622
identify and recognize objects
has been a profound failure.

377
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:47,930
There is, at this point,
no machine on earth that could

378
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:52,183
recognize people and objects and
things at the level of a really

379
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:57,146
dumb one-year-old.
And the reason why is that it's

380
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:01,548
a much harder problem than
anybody could have expected.

381
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:06,369
Well, what makes it such a hard
problem?

382
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:10,490
Well, one reason why you might
think it's an easy problem is

383
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:13,486
you say, "Okay.
We have to figure out the

384
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:15,633
problem of how people see.
Well, here's what we do."

385
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:19,329
You're in--You're over there
and here's your eye.

386
00:22:23,49 --> 00:22:23,49
And somehow it has to get to
this television monitor and then

387
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:25,902
you look at it and that'll solve
the problem of how you see.

388
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:28,850
So, sometimes people say, "Hey.
I hear the eye flips things

389
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:31,892
upside down.
I guess this guy is going to

390
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:33,944
have to get used to looking at
things upside down.

391
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,320
That's an interesting problem."
No.

392
00:22:39,69 --> 00:22:39,69
That's not the way to look at
it because that doesn't answer

393
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:43,373
any questions.
That just pushes the question

394
00:22:46,48 --> 00:22:46,48
back.
Fine.

395
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:46,750
How does "he" see?
We're not answering anything.

396
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,180
Similarly, although the
Terminator's view of the world

397
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:53,265
may correspond to that ,
that doesn't solve any problem

398
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:56,409
of how he actually sees.
So, he has all these numbers

399
00:22:59,492 --> 00:22:59,492
shooting out there.
Well, he has to read the

400
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:01,388
numbers.
He has to see this.

401
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:02,850
This is my iTunes.
[laughter] That's inadvertent.

402
00:23:10,99 --> 00:23:10,99
Here's the right way to think
about perception.

403
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:15,579
You got the eye,
which is very ugly and bloody,

404
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:19,187
and then around here you have
the retina.

405
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:22,559
And the retina is a bunch of
nerve cells.

406
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:24,829
And the nerve cells fire
at--for some stimulus and not

407
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:29,420
others.
And from this array of firings,

408
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:32,795
"firing… not firing…
firing… not firing," you have

409
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:37,399
to figure out what the world is.
So, a better view is like this.

410
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:44,369
The firings of the neurons
could be viewed as an array of

411
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:48,383
numbers.
You have to figure out how to

412
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:51,701
get from the numbers to objects
and people, and to actions and

413
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:57,173
events.
And that's the problem.

414
00:23:59,549 --> 00:23:59,549
It's made particularly a
difficult problem because the

415
00:24:03,41 --> 00:24:03,41
retina is a two-dimensional
surface and you have to infer a

416
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:06,861
3D world from a two-dimensional
surface.

417
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:09,759
And this is,
from a mathematical point of

418
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:12,749
view, impossible.
And what this means is that

419
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:15,871
there--For any two-dimensional
image there is an indefinite

420
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:19,527
number of three-dimensional
images that correspond to it.

421
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:23,309
So for instance,
suppose you have this on your

422
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:27,290
retina, an array of light shaped
like that .

423
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:31,359
What does that correspond to in
the world?

424
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:33,299
Well, it could correspond to a
thing just like that that you're

425
00:24:37,33 --> 00:24:37,33
looking for or it could
correspond to a square that's

426
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:40,165
tilted backwards.
And so, you have to figure out

427
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:43,810
which is which.
And the way we solve this

428
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:47,494
problem is that we have
unconscious assumptions about

429
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:52,518
how the world works.
Our minds contain certain

430
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:56,692
assumptions about how things
should be that enable us to make

431
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,380
educated guesses from the
two-dimensional array on to the

432
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:05,754
three-dimensional world.
And I purposefully did not make

433
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:09,616
the slides available for this
class ahead of time because I

434
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:12,604
don't want people to cheat,
but there are several points

435
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:15,420
where you could look at the
slides and confirm that some of

436
00:25:18,50 --> 00:25:18,50
the things I'm going to tell you
are actually true.

437
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:20,500
And I want to give you three
examples.

438
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:22,880
One is color.
And I'm going to conflate here

439
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:25,870
color and brightness.
The other is objects.

440
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:28,400
The other is depth.
First, the problem of color.

441
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:32,779
How do you tell a lump of coal
from a snowball?

442
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:36,210
Well, that's a lump of coal and
that's a snowball,

443
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:40,892
and it's from Google images.
How do you know which is which?

444
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:46,269
Well, a lump of coal you say is
black and a snowball is white.

445
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,240
How do you know?
Well, maybe you have on your

446
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:53,514
retina--Your retina responds to
sort of color that hits it.

447
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,130
It's oversimplified,
but let's assume that this is

448
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:00,387
true.
So, this is black coming out

449
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:02,970
and that's white and that's how
you tell.

450
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:06,359
But in fact,
that can't be right.

451
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:09,319
It can't be right because
objects' color is not merely a

452
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,430
matter of what material they're
made of but of the amount of

453
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:17,840
light that hits it.
So, as I walk across the stage

454
00:26:21,794 --> 00:26:21,794
I fall into shadow and light,
and none of you screams out,

455
00:26:26,40 --> 00:26:26,40
"Professor Bloom is changing
colors!"

456
00:26:29,19 --> 00:26:29,19
Rather, you automatically
factor out the change in

457
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:34,265
illumination as this is
happening.

458
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,119
And this could actually be
quite striking.

459
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:40,309
So, you see this display over
here.

460
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:43,830
Take a look at those two blocks.
I take it you see this one as

461
00:26:49,13 --> 00:26:49,13
lighter than that one.
You do.

462
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:52,569
You might imagine this is
because this strip is lighter

463
00:26:57,744 --> 00:26:57,744
than this but it isn't.
They're the same.

464
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:01,700
And you won't believe me until
you actually print it out and

465
00:27:06,22 --> 00:27:06,22
take a look, but they are in
fact the same.

466
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,320
I'll show it to you.
And you could say I'm tricking

467
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:11,664
you but this is the way it
works.

468
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,120
There's the close-up.
So, remember we're comparing

469
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:15,969
this and this.
Now, let's take away other

470
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:19,972
parts of the environment and
you'll see they're the same.

471
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,870
Now you say, "But hold it.
This can't be the same as this"

472
00:27:32,36 --> 00:27:32,36
but the answer is--goes like
this.

473
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:35,250
We know shadows make surfaces
darker.

474
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,180
We don't know this like "Here's
something I know."

475
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Rather, we know this in that
it's wired up in our brains.

476
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:47,109
So when we see a surface in
shadow we automatically assume

477
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:52,663
that it's lighter than it looks,
and we see it as lighter.

478
00:27:58,509 --> 00:27:58,509
And you could show this by
removing the cues to the shadow.

479
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:01,530
And you see it as it really is.
And this is an illustration of

480
00:28:05,79 --> 00:28:05,79
how the information to your eyes
is just one bit of information;

481
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:09,130
the degree of light coming from
a single source is one bit of

482
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:13,491
information that you use to
calculate certain assumptions

483
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:17,561
and come to a conclusion.
Here's a different kind of

484
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:21,537
example: Objects.
You see this and you

485
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:24,411
automatically and intuitively
segment it into different

486
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:28,680
objects.
You segment it into a man and a

487
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:31,832
house and birds and trees.
How do you do this?

488
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:36,599
It turns out,
to program a computer to

489
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:38,963
segment a scene into different
objects is hugely difficult and

490
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:42,860
the question of how we do it is,
to some extent, unknown.

491
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:47,210
But one answer to this question
is there are certain cues in the

492
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:51,137
environment that are signals
that you're dealing with

493
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:54,378
different objects.
And these cues are often

494
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:57,362
described as Gestalt principles.
So, one example is "proximity."

495
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,140
When you see things that are
close to each other,

496
00:29:05,172 --> 00:29:05,172
you're more likely than not to
assume that they belong to the

497
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:08,962
same thing.
There's "similarity."

498
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:11,460
That display could correspond
to an indefinite number of

499
00:29:15,37 --> 00:29:15,37
objects but you naturally tend
to see it as two.

500
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:18,289
You do one with one texture
pattern, the other with the

501
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:22,139
other texture pattern.
"Closure."

502
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:25,210
The fact that this is a closed
square here suggests it's a

503
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:29,192
single object .
"Good continuation."

504
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,160
If you had to judge,
this could just as well be two

505
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:35,725
shapes, one that runs from A to
C, the other one that runs from

506
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:40,145
D to B.
But you don't tend to see it

507
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:42,131
that way.
Rather, you tend to see it as

508
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:44,580
one that runs from A to B,
the other one that runs from C

509
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:48,482
to D.
"Common movement."

510
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:50,579
If things move together they're
a single object.

511
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,140
And "good form."
You see the object over there .

512
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:57,380
In the absence of any other
information, you might be

513
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:00,906
tempted to say that's a single
thing, a plus sign maybe.

514
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:04,839
This , because it has lousy
form, you're more tempted to say

515
00:30:08,764 --> 00:30:08,764
it's two things,
one thing lying on top of each

516
00:30:11,824 --> 00:30:11,824
other.
And these are the sort of cues,

517
00:30:14,742 --> 00:30:14,742
expectations;
none of them are right.

518
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,269
There's cases where they could
all fool you.

519
00:30:21,99 --> 00:30:21,99
But these are useful cues that
guide our parceling of the

520
00:30:25,93 --> 00:30:25,93
world, our segmenting of the
world into distinct objects.

521
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Here they are summarized .
And here's a case where they

522
00:30:32,176 --> 00:30:32,176
fool you .
So you might think,

523
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:34,931
if you're suggestible,
that there is a triangle here.

524
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:40,990
And this is a case where there
are certain cues driving you to

525
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:44,226
think that there's a triangle
here.

526
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,190
There is, however,
no triangle here.

527
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:48,380
If you cover up these little
Pacmen here, the triangle goes

528
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:53,466
away.
Similarly, there is no square

529
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:55,381
in the middle .
There is no square.

530
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:58,760
It's very Matrix.
And these are illusions because

531
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,669
these are cues that there should
be a square there,

532
00:31:08,393 --> 00:31:08,393
the regularity of form.
Finally, "depth."

533
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:12,799
You see this and you don't--You
see it on one level as a flat

534
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:17,423
thing.
Another level you look inside

535
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:19,492
the picture and you see,
for instance,

536
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:21,346
the man is in front of the
house.

537
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,150
You look at me and you see the
podium.

538
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:26,990
And if you have a terrible
neurological disorder you see

539
00:31:29,918 --> 00:31:29,918
this strange creature that's
half podium leading on to a

540
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:32,847
chest and up to a head that's
sort of--the top of him is

541
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:35,776
wiggling and the podium staying
still.

542
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:38,119
If you are neurologically
normal, you see a man walking

543
00:31:41,80 --> 00:31:41,80
back and forth behind a podium.
How do you do that?

544
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:44,289
Well, this is really a problem
because, I could give you a

545
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:49,642
technical reason why vision is
hard,

546
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:53,210
but crudely,
you got a two-dimensional

547
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:55,216
retina and you have to figure
out a three-dimensional world.

548
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:58,580
How do you do it?
And the answer once again is

549
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:02,397
assumptions or cues.
There are certain assumptions

550
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:06,305
the visual system makes that
aren't always right and in fact,

551
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:10,720
in cases of visual illusions,
can be wrong but will guide you

552
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:14,788
to perceive the world in a
correct and accurate way.

553
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:18,450
So for example,
there is binocular disparity.

554
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:22,359
This is actually a sort of
interesting one.

555
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:24,890
This is the only depth cue that
involves two eyes.

556
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:27,829
If I look at you pretty close,
the image I get here and the

557
00:32:32,965 --> 00:32:32,965
image I get here are somewhat
different while--or I have to

558
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:38,101
focus my eyes together to get
the same image.

559
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,440
If I look at you in back,
they're almost identical

560
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:45,278
because the further away,
given the two eyes that are

561
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:48,290
static, the closer the images
look.

562
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:50,549
And it's not,
again, that you say to

563
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:52,368
yourself, "Oh.
Back there an orange.

564
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:55,170
It's the same image in my right
eye and my left eye.

565
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,430
You must be far away."
Rather, unconsciously and

566
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:00,714
automatically you make
estimations on how far people

567
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:04,680
are in depth based on binocular
disparity.

568
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,180
There is "interposition."
How do you know I'm in front of

569
00:33:12,62 --> 00:33:12,62
the podium and the podium's not
in front of me?

570
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,870
No.
How do you know the podium's in

571
00:33:17,716 --> 00:33:17,716
front of me?
Well, from where I'm standing

572
00:33:20,68 --> 00:33:20,68
it's right.
How do you know the podium is

573
00:33:22,58 --> 00:33:22,58
in front of me?
Well, because I'm walking here

574
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:26,165
and then it cuts into me.
And unless I'm going through a

575
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:30,855
grotesque metamorphosis,
what's happening is it makes

576
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:33,897
sense to say I'm moving behind
the podium.

577
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:36,530
Interposition.
You take the guy.

578
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,380
How do you know the guy is
standing in front of the house?

579
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:40,740
Well, because there is--you see
all of him and he's blocking a

580
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:47,633
lot of the house.
There's relative size.

581
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,750
How far away am I?
Well, if you looked at me and

582
00:33:55,58 --> 00:33:55,58
you had to estimate how far away
I am, part of the way you'll

583
00:33:59,235 --> 00:33:59,235
figure that out is you know how
tall a human's supposed to be.

584
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:03,759
If you thought that I was fifty
feet tall, you would assume I'm

585
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:08,891
further away than I am.
And so, your judgments on size

586
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:13,290
dictate your judgments about
distance.

587
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Usually, this cue isn't
necessary but if you look at the

588
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:19,971
Empire State Building--If you go
into a field and you see a tower

589
00:34:24,221 --> 00:34:24,221
and you look,
your judgment of how far away

590
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:27,627
the tower's going to be depends
on your knowledge of how tall a

591
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:32,496
tower should be.
If it's this tall, you say, "Oh.

592
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:36,159
It must be--" And then you'd be
surprised.

593
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:38,760
There's texture gradient,
which I'll explain in a second,

594
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:44,322
and linear perspective,
which I'll also explain in a

595
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:49,387
second.
Texture gradient goes like this.

596
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,210
Remember the problem we had
before.

597
00:34:54,59 --> 00:34:54,59
How do you know if that thing
is this object or an object in

598
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:00,691
and of itself?
Well, the answer is things with

599
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:04,732
textures will show themselves
because the textures will get

600
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:08,927
smaller from a distance.
Now, logically,

601
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:11,827
this could still be a single
thing standing upright with just

602
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:15,619
dots going up smaller.
But the natural assumption is

603
00:35:19,442 --> 00:35:19,442
the reason why the dots recede
in this regular fashion is

604
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:23,771
because it's receding in depth.
Classic illusion – the

605
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:28,963
Mueller-Lyer illusion.
People will see this as longer

606
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:34,191
than this .
It's not.

607
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,320
If you don't believe me,
print it out and measure it.

608
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:39,769
Related to the Ponzo illusion,
once again people see this one

609
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:44,186
as--you get illusions named
after you when you discover

610
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:48,161
these--this one as longer than
this .

611
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Again, it's not.
What's going on here?

612
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:53,940
Well, the top line looks longer
even though it isn't.

613
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,170
And one explanation for why is,
these other lines in the scene

614
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:04,321
cause your visual system to make
guesses about distance.

615
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:09,219
And then you correct for
distance by making assumptions

616
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:13,894
about size.
If you have two lines--You'll

617
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:16,713
get--We'll get in more detail in
a second, but if you have two

618
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:20,275
lines and they take up the same
amount of space on your retina,

619
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,130
but you believe that one is 100
feet away and the other's 50

620
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,100
feet away, the one that's 100
feet away you will see as bigger

621
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:32,206
because your brain will say,
"Well, if it takes up just this

622
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:36,109
much space but it's further
away, it must be bigger than

623
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:39,213
something that's closer and
takes up that much space."

624
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:42,430
And that's what goes on here.
For the top line,

625
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:45,568
for the Mueller-Lyer illusion,
we assume that this is further

626
00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:49,656
away and this is closer based on
the cues to distance.

627
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:53,540
And the cue is factored in.
And because we assume that this

628
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:57,449
is further away,
we assume it must be bigger to

629
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:00,535
take up the same space as this
which is closer.

630
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:03,889
Similarly for the Ponzo
illusion.

631
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:05,940
There's linear perspective.
Parallel lines tend to recede

632
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:09,550
in distance.
If this top one is further away

633
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:12,649
than this but they take up the
same size in your eye,

634
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:16,589
this one must be bigger and you
see it as bigger.

635
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:20,530
And the book offers more
details on how these illusions

636
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:25,142
work.
I'm going to end with an

637
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:27,101
illusion that I'm not even going
to bother explaining.

638
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:30,219
I'll just show it to you
because you should be able to,

639
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:32,970
based on thinking about these
other illusions,

640
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:35,263
figure it out.
It was developed by Roger

641
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:37,496
Shepard.
Well, you know that.

642
00:37:40,79 --> 00:37:40,79
And they are called Shepard
tables .

643
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:42,829
And the thing about it is,
these look like two tables.

644
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:45,630
If you ask people--You don't
frame in terms of here's a

645
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,310
lecture on visual perception.
You ask people,

646
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:50,648
"Which of these tables would be
easier to get through a door if

647
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:53,949
you have a thin door?"
People would say the one on the

648
00:37:56,746 --> 00:37:56,746
left.
This one looks sort of thicker

649
00:37:58,977 --> 00:37:58,977
and harder to get through.
This one looks longer and

650
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:01,919
leaner.
In fact, they're the same size.

651
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:04,579
What I mean by that is that
this is exactly the same as this

652
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:13,429
.
Now, I'm going to prove it to

653
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:15,681
you by showing you something
which took me--on the computer

654
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:19,283
which took me about seven hours
to do.

655
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,829
And nobody's going to believe
it because I could have faked

656
00:38:24,85 --> 00:38:24,85
it.
But if you want,

657
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:25,315
print it out and do it
yourself.

658
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:27,449
You just take a piece of paper,
put it on here.

659
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Then you move it and the same.
I showed it to somebody and

660
00:38:38,178 --> 00:38:38,178
they called me a liar.
Anyway, you could do it

661
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:41,856
yourself in the privacy of your
own home or study.

662
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:45,840
But what I'd really like you to
do after you do it is say,

663
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:50,847
"Okay.
Fine.

664
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:52,219
Why does this one look longer
and thinner than this one?"

665
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:55,650
And the answer is the same
answer that will explain the

666
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:58,505
Mueller-Lyer illusion and the
Ponzo illusion,

667
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:00,989
having to do with cues to depth
and the way your mind corrects

668
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:06,627
the perception of depth.
And that's all I have to say at

669
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:12,563
this point about perception.
I want to move now to attention

670
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:18,479
and memory and I'm going to
treat attention and memory

671
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:22,940
together.
We are fascinated with memory

672
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:26,410
and, in particular,
it's particularly interesting

673
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:30,483
when memory goes wrong.
It's particularly fascinating

674
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:35,700
what happens in cases of
amnesia.

675
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:39,230
So for example,
I need a volunteer who is

676
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:42,555
willing to do a little bit of
acting, a very little bit,

677
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:47,128
an incredibly little bit.
Excellent.

678
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:50,330
Okay.
So well, you just stay there.

679
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:51,830
So pretend you have amnesia.
Okay?

680
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:54,640
What's your name?
Student: I don't know.

681
00:40:00,10 --> 00:40:00,10
Professor Paul Bloom:
Perfect.

682
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:00,830
I'm really glad you said that.
That's the wrong answer because

683
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:03,580
you don't have total amnesia.
You still remember English.

684
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Okay.
It's very clever.

685
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:09,230
Okay.
So you couldn't have lost all

686
00:40:12,52 --> 00:40:12,52
your memories.
You have English.

687
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:14,330
You --So we'll do you.
What's your name?

688
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:19,290
Oh.
He looks puzzled but he still

689
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:22,416
maintains bowel and bladder
control so he hasn't forgotten

690
00:40:27,107 --> 00:40:27,107
everything.
[laughter]

691
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:29,185
Now, I always lose the third
volunteer in that demo.

692
00:40:34,90 --> 00:40:34,90
So, what I'm saying is that
memory is a hugely broad

693
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:40,310
concept.
It includes autobiographical

694
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:43,367
memory, which is what we
standardly think.

695
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,190
That's a perfectly rational
response.

696
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:48,679
When I say somebody's losing
their memory,

697
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:50,860
"Oh.
I have a movie about somebody

698
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:52,539
losing their memory," you don't
imagine a person in diapers.

699
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,400
You imagine the person walking
around, having sex with cool

700
00:40:58,394 --> 00:40:58,394
people and saying,
"Where am I?"

701
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,150
And [laughter]
so what you imagine is you

702
00:41:03,123 --> 00:41:03,123
imagine them losing their
autobiographical memory,

703
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:06,765
their sense of self.
But of course,

704
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:09,535
knowing English is part of your
memory and knowing how to stand

705
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:13,900
and knowing how to chew and
swallow are all things that

706
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:17,702
you've learned,
that you've--that have been

707
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:20,741
molded by experience.
There's another distinction

708
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:23,744
which is going to come in
regarding amnesia,

709
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:26,411
which is there's broadly two
types of amnesia.

710
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:29,449
They often run together,
but one type of amnesia is you

711
00:41:33,496 --> 00:41:33,496
lose your memory of the past.
Another type of amnesia--That's

712
00:41:38,435 --> 00:41:38,435
the Matt Damon amnesia.
Another type of amnesia though

713
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:42,836
is you lose the ability to form
new memories.

714
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,480
And here's a film of a man who
had exactly this problem.

715
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:51,230
He was a world-renowned choir
director and he suffered viral

716
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:55,896
encephalitis which led to brain
damage which destroyed most of

717
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:00,720
his temporal lobes,
his hippocampus,

718
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:03,515
and a lot of his left frontal
lobe.

719
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:05,710
It could be--It could have been
worse in that he retains the

720
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:09,702
ability to talk.
He seems to be--He's not

721
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:12,306
intellectually impaired.
He just can't form new memories

722
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:16,578
and so he lives in this
perpetual "now" where just

723
00:42:21,48 --> 00:42:21,48
nothing affects him and he
feels--This has not always

724
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:25,792
happened.
There's more than one of these

725
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:28,932
cases and it doesn't always
happen like this,

726
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:31,663
but he feels continually reborn
at every moment.

727
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:34,829
And we'll return to this and
then ask what's going on here.

728
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,440
But there's a few themes here.
I want to, before getting into

729
00:42:44,33 --> 00:42:44,33
detail about memory,
I want to review some basic

730
00:42:46,685 --> 00:42:46,685
distinctions in memory when we
talk about memory.

731
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:49,619
So crudely, you could make a
distinction between sensory

732
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:53,137
memory, short-term memory,
which is also known as working

733
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:56,719
memory, and long-term memory.
Sensory memory is a residue in

734
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:00,650
your senses.
There's a flash of lightning.

735
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:03,560
You might see an afterimage.
That afterimage is your sensory

736
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:08,280
memory.
There's somewhat of a longer

737
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:11,114
echoic memory for sounds.
So as somebody is talking to

738
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:14,744
you even if you're not paying
attention you'll store a few

739
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:17,929
seconds of what they're saying,
which is sometimes,

740
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:20,703
when somebody's talking to you
and you're not listening to them

741
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:23,554
and they say,
"You're not listening to me."

742
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:25,700
And you say, "No.
You were talking about--" and

743
00:43:28,455 --> 00:43:28,455
pick up the last couple of
seconds from echoic memory.

744
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:31,690
There's short-term memory.
Anybody remember what I just

745
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:37,368
said?
If you did, that's short-term

746
00:43:40,602 --> 00:43:40,602
memory--spans for a few minutes.
And then there's long-term

747
00:43:44,983 --> 00:43:44,983
memory.
Anybody know who Elvis is?

748
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:46,980
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you live?

749
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:49,469
Your long-term memory store
that you walk around with and

750
00:43:53,252 --> 00:43:53,252
you're not going to lose right
away.

751
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:55,820
When we think about amnesia in
the movie sense,

752
00:43:59,487 --> 00:43:59,487
we think of a certain loss of
long-term memory associated with

753
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:04,350
autobiographical personal
events.

754
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:07,300
There is a distinction between
implicit and explicit,

755
00:44:10,129 --> 00:44:10,129
which we'll talk about it in
more detail.

756
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:12,469
But explicit,
crudely, is what you have

757
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:14,851
conscious access to.
So, what you had for dinner

758
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:18,611
last night.
You could think back and say,

759
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:21,115
"I had this for dinner last
night."

760
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:22,910
Implicit is more unconscious.

761
00:44:25,70 --> 00:44:25,70


762
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:28,630
What the word--what certain
word--what the word "had" means,

763
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:32,452
how to walk,
how to ride a bicycle,

764
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:34,849
that you might not be able to
articulate and might not even be

765
00:44:39,41 --> 00:44:39,41
conscious of but still have
access to.

766
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:41,789
There's a distinction between
semantic memory and episodic

767
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:45,581
memory.
Semantic memory is basically

768
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:48,903
facts, what a word means,
what's the capital of Canada,

769
00:44:54,155 --> 00:44:54,155
and so on.
Episodic is autobiography,

770
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:57,724
is what happened to you.
That Yale is in New Haven is

771
00:45:05,24 --> 00:45:05,24
semantic.
That you went on vacation away

772
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:09,613
from New Haven last week,
it would be episodic.

773
00:45:14,50 --> 00:45:14,50
There is encoding stores and
retrieval, which refers to

774
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:18,222
different levels of what happens
in memory.

775
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:21,699
Encoding is getting the memory
in, as when you study for a test

776
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:26,288
or you have an experience.
And storage is holding the

777
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:30,730
memory.
And retrieval is getting the

778
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:34,371
memory out.
Finally, retrieval is often

779
00:45:37,603 --> 00:45:37,603
broken, conveniently,
into recall versus recognition,

780
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:41,570
where recall is when you just
pull it out of memory and

781
00:45:45,30 --> 00:45:45,30
recognition is when you
recognize what corresponds to

782
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:48,363
something in the past.
Anybody remember what color tie

783
00:45:52,222 --> 00:45:52,222
I had on two days ago?
Oh.

784
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:55,110
Okay.
Well, that would be impossible

785
00:46:00,25 --> 00:46:00,25
to remember but if I asked you,
"Is it purple or is it orange?"

786
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,750
that would be much easier.
[laughter]

787
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:12,520
Now, you could break up,
crudely, the memory into

788
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:16,509
stages.
So you start that sensory

789
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:18,986
memory is just the stuff that
comes in leading to short-term

790
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:22,871
memory, leading to long-term
memory.

791
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:25,440
And this stage theory is
something which we'll discuss in

792
00:46:29,96 --> 00:46:29,96
more detail.
But this leads us to the issue

793
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:33,753
of attention.
How do you get memory from your

794
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:37,526
sensations, from what you're
hearing?

795
00:46:40,10 --> 00:46:40,10
I'm speaking to you.
You're hearing me.

796
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:42,199
How does it ever get in to the
other systems?

797
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:45,389
What decides what's remembered
and what's not?

798
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:47,590
There's all sorts of things
happening to you now.

799
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:49,840
The seat of your chair is
pressing against your butt.

800
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:55,310
You wouldn't say, "Oh.
I want to remember this forever.

801
00:46:57,469 --> 00:46:57,469
The seat's pressing against my
butt."

802
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:00,239
[laughter]
Your neighbor is exuding a

803
00:47:02,94 --> 00:47:02,94
certain sort of smell.
You're thinking about something.

804
00:47:05,40 --> 00:47:05,40
Your eyes follow him.
Not everything gets in memory.

805
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:07,489
You'd go mad if you tried to
remember everything.

806
00:47:10,70 --> 00:47:10,70
You can't.
So, what determines what gets

807
00:47:13,553 --> 00:47:13,553
into memory?
Well, one answer is "attention

808
00:47:17,736 --> 00:47:17,736
does."
And attention is--could be

809
00:47:20,723 --> 00:47:20,723
crudely viewed as a flashlight,
a spotlight on experience that

810
00:47:26,57 --> 00:47:26,57
willingly zooms in on something
and makes it memorable.

811
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:31,130
Attention has certain
properties.

812
00:47:33,39 --> 00:47:33,39
Some things come from
attention--to attention

813
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:36,325
effortlessly and automatically.
Here's an example.

814
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:40,670
You're going to see an array of
letters here.

815
00:47:43,80 --> 00:47:43,80
One of them's going to be green.
When you see the green one,

816
00:47:49,704 --> 00:47:49,704
please clap.
[laughter]

817
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:53,417
No, not this green one.
[laughter]

818
00:47:57,922 --> 00:47:57,922
There's going to be another
slide.

819
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:01,360
Okay.
You're ready now.

820
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:10,710
but there's going to be an "o."
When you see it clap.

821
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:16,110
Okay.
Sometimes it's work.

822
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:19,540
Find the red "o."
[laughter] It's harder.

823
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:35,710
Sometimes attention is
involuntary.

824
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:40,290
I need a volunteer.
And all I want to do is I want

825
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:45,125
to show you colors on the screen
and I'd like you to name the

826
00:48:48,356 --> 00:48:48,356
colors as they come out.

827
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:49,810


828
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:52,860
Do you want this?
Student 1: I'm

829
00:48:54,249 --> 00:48:54,249
colorblind.
Professor Paul Bloom: Oh.

830
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:57,559
[laughter]
The first one is easy.

831
00:48:58,629 --> 00:48:58,629
See.
This is--You have to just go

832
00:48:59,511 --> 00:48:59,511
down the colors .
Anybody?

833
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:01,490
Okay.
Student 2: Red,

834
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:07,185
green, blue,
black, green,

835
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:08,567
blue, red, blue,
black, red.

836
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,280
Professor Paul Bloom:
Excellent.

837
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:15,760
[applause] Okay.
Now these.

838
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:17,610
These will be words but just
name--Okay, you.

839
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:20,760
Just name the colors.
Student 3: Green,

840
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:25,637
red, blue, black,
blue, red, green,

841
00:49:28,963 --> 00:49:28,963
black, red, blue.
Professor Paul Bloom:

842
00:49:31,646 --> 00:49:31,646
Perfect.
Now, we'll go back to you,

843
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:33,753
same deal, words.
Student 4: Red,

844
00:49:35,822 --> 00:49:35,822
blue, green -- Professor
Paul Bloom: No,

845
00:49:37,438 --> 00:49:37,438
no, no.
Huh uh.

846
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:38,300
Don't--I know you can read.
The colors.

847
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:41,940
Student 4: Okay.
Sorry.

848
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:43,390
Okay.
Blue, green,

849
00:49:45,206 --> 00:49:45,206
red, green, black,
green, blue,

850
00:49:48,545 --> 00:49:48,545
black, red, Professor Paul
Bloom: Very good actually.

851
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:55,559
[laughter]
That's known as the Stroop

852
00:49:59,599 --> 00:49:59,599
effect.
Being an expert reader,

853
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:02,566
as you are, your knowledge of
reading, your attention to what

854
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,670
the words meant,
subverted your desire to do the

855
00:50:11,669 --> 00:50:11,669
task.
You couldn't make that go away

856
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,240
even if you wanted to.
If somebody gave you $1,000 to

857
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:17,453
read this as fast as you read
this, and as fast as you read

858
00:50:21,113 --> 00:50:21,113
this, you'd be unable to.
You can't block it.

859
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:24,780
There is some work--There are
some interesting discoveries

860
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:29,621
about attention.
I have a demonstration here.

861
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:32,880
I'd like people actually--It's
important--Some of you may have

862
00:50:36,135 --> 00:50:36,135
seen this before.
It's important for you to be

863
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:39,143
silent throughout it.
What you're going to see is

864
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:42,208
you're going to see two teams of
basketball players.

865
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:45,150
One of them is going to have
white T-shirts.

866
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,380
The other one will have black
T-shirts.

867
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:54,719
They'll be passing balls back
and forth.

868
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:57,750
What I'd like you to do is
count in your head how many

869
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:02,591
passes the white team does with
the ball.

870
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:06,519
[laughter]
What number did people get?

871
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:07,830
Okay.
Did anybody notice anything

872
00:51:12,434 --> 00:51:12,434
unusual?
[laughter]

873
00:51:13,777 --> 00:51:13,777
Did anybody not notice anything
unusual?

874
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:15,490
Okay.
Some people did not notice

875
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:18,742
anything unusual.
Those who didn't see anything

876
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:22,501
unusual, watch this again and
just watch it.

877
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,710
[laughter]
About 50% of people when

878
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:28,869
counting, who have never seen
this before don't notice

879
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:32,234
anything.
But then when you're not

880
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:34,208
counting it's kind of obvious
what you're missing.

881
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:36,650


882
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,400
[laughter]
And this is one demonstration

883
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:55,551
among many of the fact that when
you're attending to something

884
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:00,481
you have a very small window of
attention and you lose the focus

885
00:52:05,572 --> 00:52:05,572
on other things.
Here's another different

886
00:52:10,993 --> 00:52:10,993
example.
I'd like people to watch a

887
00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:13,924
movie and pay attention very
closely to what happens in the

888
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:17,414
movie and try to remember this.
How many of you noticed

889
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:20,702
something odd in that movie?
How many of you didn't?

890
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:24,320
Okay.
Now, everybody look at the

891
00:52:29,18 --> 00:52:29,18
scarf, the color of the plates
and the food,

892
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:33,564
among other things.
The phenomena,

893
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:36,940
in general, has been called
"change blindness."

894
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:40,539
And what it is is we tend to
be--when there's a focus of

895
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:44,109
attention focused in a certain
way,

896
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:46,510
we tend to be oblivious to
other things that go on in the

897
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:49,773
environment.
Often it is,

898
00:52:51,497 --> 00:52:51,497
in fact, quite difficult when
there's a change in scene to

899
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:55,806
notice what changes and what
stays the same.

900
00:52:59,360 --> 00:52:59,360
So, in this final demo,
there's just going to be two

901
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:07,634
pictures flicking.
Could you clap when you see

902
00:53:12,21 --> 00:53:12,21
what's different between the two
pictures?

903
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:13,840


904
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:30,840
[applause]
[laughter]

905
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:31,475
I myself am terrible at these
and so I have a lot of sympathy.

906
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:33,510
How many people never saw it?

907
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,630


908
00:53:46,80 --> 00:53:46,80
[laughter] Good.
That's very impressive.

909
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:56,570
[laughter]
One more time with a different

910
00:53:57,543 --> 00:53:57,543
one.

911
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:57,690


912
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:14,650
[applause]
Did anybody not see it?

913
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:16,700
Be honest.
I'll give you another try.

914
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,540


915
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:33,880
[applause] Okay.
I'll put you out of your misery.

916
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:35,920


917
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460
[laughter]
This is work by Dan Simons and

918
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:48,721
it's part of an extraordinarily
interesting body of work on

919
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:53,450
what's known as "change
blindness."

920
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:56,630
And what this means is,
the phenomena is,

921
00:55:00,156 --> 00:55:00,156
we have a very narrow focus of
attention and huge changes can

922
00:55:05,446 --> 00:55:05,446
happen that we are oblivious to.
This is why,

923
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:09,274
in movies, there are so
many--so much difficulty with

924
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:12,110
continuity changes.
Dan Simons is also famous for

925
00:55:15,327 --> 00:55:15,327
having brought this outside of
the laboratory in some classic

926
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:19,500
experiments and I'm trying to
get the film corresponding to

927
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:23,534
them.
What he did was that he did

928
00:55:25,786 --> 00:55:25,786
this great study in the Cornell
campus where he was--where what

929
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,360
happened is they would get some
unsuspecting person walking

930
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:32,704
through campus and some guy
would come over and say,

931
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:35,990
"Excuse me, Sir.
I'm lost.

932
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:38,760
Could you help me with
directions?"

933
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:40,860
And have a map and then the
person would say,

934
00:55:43,234 --> 00:55:43,234
"Sure."
And then there'd be two

935
00:55:45,88 --> 00:55:45,88
construction workers holding a
door.

936
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:47,289
And these guys were going to
rudely bump between these two

937
00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:51,113
characters and then the
experimenter gets switched with

938
00:55:54,736 --> 00:55:54,736
another guy.
So now, when these two guys

939
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180
walk away, the subject is
standing there with an entirely

940
00:56:00,24 --> 00:56:00,24
different person.
[laughter]

941
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:02,356
What's interesting is nobody
notices.

942
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:07,360
[laughter]
They notice if the person

943
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:09,659
changes sexes.
"Didn't you used to be a woman?"

944
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:13,690
[laughter]
And they notice if the

945
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,180
experimenter changes races,
but most other changes they're

946
00:56:20,616 --> 00:56:20,616
oblivious to.
There's another experiment.

947
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:23,329
I think Brian Scholl did this
one but it may have been Dan

948
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:27,619
Simons where what happens is a
subject comes in to the lab.

949
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:32,210
They say, "If you're going to
do an experiment with us,

950
00:56:35,795 --> 00:56:35,795
you need to sign the human
subject form."

951
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:38,650
Hands him the form,
the experimenter.

952
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:40,440
The subject signs the form.
The experimenter takes the form

953
00:56:43,147 --> 00:56:43,147
and says, "Thank you.
I'll put it down here."

954
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:45,119
Goes down here and then a
different person pops up.

955
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:49,140
[laughter] People don't notice.
And there's a certain level on

956
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:53,328
which we're oblivious to
changes.

957
00:56:56,70 --> 00:56:56,70
What's weird is we don't
see--we don't think we are.

958
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,000
We think we see the world as it
is and we don't know--notice

959
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:02,687
that when we're attending to
something;

960
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:05,250
everything else gets blanked
out.

961
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:07,150
And so about 50% of people who
have never seen this demo

962
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:10,902
before, the gorilla demo,
they don't notice the gorilla.

963
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:14,860
And there's--you couldn't
imagine anything more obvious.

964
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:18,940
The gorilla study was actually
done a very long time ago.

965
00:57:23,30 --> 00:57:23,30
And it was originally done in a
different way but I'll show it

966
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:28,445
to you just because this is the
original study and now that you

967
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:33,949
all know what to expect--Oh,
not that one.

968
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:37,640
Oops.
Nope.

969
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:45,199
That's actually--If you looked
at that quickly,

970
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:47,665
it's a current Yale professor.
Oh.

971
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:50,489
I'm never going to get my DVD
back.

972
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:52,739
Anyway, I'll show you the other
demo on--next week.

973
00:58:01,60 --> 00:58:01,60
I will.
[laughter]

974
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:05,409
Any questions about attention
and memory at this point?

975
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:08,770
Yeah.
Student: [inaudible]

976
00:58:13,171 --> 00:58:13,171
Professor Paul Bloom:
Yeah.

977
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:16,790
Why does it work that way?
Why is it--Why do things that

978
00:58:20,947 --> 00:58:20,947
become very practiced become
automatic and involuntary?

979
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:24,360
It's a good question.
I don't know.

980
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:27,500
We know that they do.
We know that once you--that you

981
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:31,611
can't not read once you know how
to read.

982
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:34,960
You also can't not listen.
If I'm talking to you and I'm

983
00:58:40,144 --> 00:58:40,144
extremely boring,
but I'm talking to you,

984
00:58:43,336 --> 00:58:43,336
it's very hard not to listen.
You can't shut off your ears.

985
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:47,250
You could put your fingers in
them but you can't shut off

986
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:50,309
your--You also can't shut your
eyes without actually shutting

987
00:58:53,588 --> 00:58:53,588
them.
You can't say,

988
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:54,864
"This is a disgusting movie.
I'm not going to attend to it."

989
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:00,539
[laughter]
So, that's not answering your

990
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:02,958
question.
It's just saying that your

991
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:04,882
observation is a right one and a
more general one.

992
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:07,320
When you're good at something
and you're over-practiced,

993
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:11,340
it becomes involuntary and you
cannot stop it.

994
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:14,850
Okay.
Well--Oh.

995
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:16,990
One more in back.
Yes.

996
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:19,619
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

997
00:59:21,53 --> 00:59:21,53
What now?
Sorry.

998
00:59:22,50 --> 00:59:22,50
Over there.
Yeah.

999
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,630
Student: [inaudible]
right before his accident?

1000
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:28,820
Professor Paul Bloom:
Did he remember things before

1001
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:30,379
his accident?
Yes.

1002
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:31,889
He had some amnesia of events
before his accident but he did

1003
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:35,422
remember things.
He knew his name and he knew

1004
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:37,929
other things about his life.
Okay.

1005
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:40,630
I'll see you next week.
