The economic costs of schizophrenia are considerable.

1
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,360
A 2012 report published by the London School of Economics and Policy found that the annual

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,820
societal cost of schizophrenia in England is 11.8 billion pounds, which equates to around

3
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,920
fifteen billion US dollars or 20 billion Australian dollars.

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,529
So, what sorts of expenses are associated with schizophrenia?

5
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,360
First let’s look at the distinction between direct and indirect costs.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,630
Direct costs refer to the resources that are used to treat or support an individual with

7
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,420
an illness.

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,150
Indirect costs refer to the value of the production that people with schizophrenia and their carers

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:54,750
are unable to produce as a function of either their illness and/or early mortality as a

10
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,600
consequence of the illness.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,490
In terms of direct costs, we are looking at health sector costs – ranging from visits

12
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,740
to the GP to hospital admissions.

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,600
For someone living with schizophrenia, it’s quite likely that, across the course of their

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,490
life, they are going to spend time in a hospital as part of their treatment or management of

15
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,229
their illness.

16
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:20,909
Another direct health sector cost is medication.

17
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,630
Other direct costs include expenses related to accommodation (for instance, the provision

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,249
of crisis care, and supported care); and the involvement of services or agencies such as

19
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:34,280
employment support services.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,880
The indirect costs of schizophrenia are not as immediately obvious.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,170
The biggest indirect costs associated with this illness are productivity losses.

22
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,890
Many people with schizophrenia find it difficult to remain employed.

23
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,920
‘Lost production’ is the expected earnings forgone when a person with schizophrenia is

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,579
unable to work.

25
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,150
Often, a person suffering from schizophrenia will have an informal carer, who is also unable

26
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,079
to work – this is another indirect cost.

27
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,900
Other costs include the lost revenue through income tax forgone due to a lack of productivity,

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,390
the cost of transfer payments (income support payments and pensions) and costs associated

29
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,030
with absenteeism.

30
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,100
In thinking about indirect costs of an illness – whether we’re talking about schizophrenia

31
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,370
or any other illness – it’s important to be aware of the term, Disability Adjusted

32
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,890
Life Years or DALYs.

33
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,380
DALYs is a little abstract, but it causes the largest amount of economic burden.

34
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,530
It refers to the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the

35
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,590
years of productive life lost due to disability.
