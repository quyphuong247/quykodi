Freud had another theory about personality that was to do with how we develop.

1
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:14,799
This was known as the psychosexual theory of development.

2
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,550
The idea is that, personality development involves passing through the different psychosexual

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,990
stages of development.

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,119
Freud proposed that people start out at the oral stage––where they get pleasure from

5
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,449
biting, sucking, and so on.

6
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,470
And they move on ... ...to the anal stage––where they get pleasure

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,540
from bowel movements.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,760
...to the phallic stage––where they get pleasure from genitals.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,360
...to the latency stage––where they go through suppressed or latent sexuality.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,430
...and then finally, the genital stage––where they hit puberty.

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,850
Freud would interpret a client&#39;s distress or condition based on where he thought they

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,970
got fixated.

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,080
He thought fixation is what produced problems for people.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,930
If somebody presented and they had the problem of excessive eating––they couldn&#39;t stop

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,360
eating, he would interpret that as oral fixation, and that they needed to work on whatever it

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,390
is that caused them to become stuck at the oral stage, so they could move through the

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,510
other stages of personality development.
