0
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,820
So, by cutting the one test in half, we’re assuming that the first half of the test is

1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,929
measuring the same thing as the second half.

2
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:20,330
If the test consists of verbal intelligence questions in the first half and spatial intelligence

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:26,220
in the second half, the two halves of the test are not really measuring the same thing.

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,430
If we then split the test in half and compare performance between the two, the performance

5
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,640
could be different––not because the test is not reliable, but because the parts of

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,820
the test we’re comparing are measuring different things.

7
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:43,860
Well, we can solve this problem by dividing the test in many different ways.

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,500
There are many different ways we can split the test in half.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,130
We could take the odd and even items, or jumble them up and sort them into two parts randomly.

10
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,160
Split half reliability effectively does that, statistically.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,320
What it will do is jumble up the test in all different possible halves and give us the

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,309
average correlation of all those halves.

13
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:06,190
That&#39;s what split half reliability does.

14
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,500
It&#39;s pretty neat!

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,200
Test retest reliability involves getting the same group of people to complete the same

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,490
test twice.

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,479
For example, we could ask a sample of university students to complete the test in the first

18
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,220
week of the semester, and then ask the same group of students to complete the same test

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,229
in the last week of the semester.

20
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:29,960
We could then compare their performance on the two occasions.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,510
We could plot the results on a graph, I think you know where I’m going with this!

22
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,610
This is the exact same graph as before and the same idea conceptually.

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,119
We’re looking for people who scored low on time one to also score low on time two,

24
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,980
and people who score high at time one who also score high at time two.

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,799
The scores are roughly the same between the two testing times.

26
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,049
This would indicate that our test reliability is high.

27
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:02,560
However, this is what the scores might look like if our test reliability is low.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,760
It looks like there&#39;s no relation between the scores for the first time the test is

29
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,910
taken compared to the second time the test is taken.

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,160
They are all over the place.

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,300
So, this is reliability and how we assess it.

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,190
Now, test retest reliability assumes that what we&#39;re measuring in the test is stable.

33
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:28,390
For example, people’s level of intelligence is normally quite stable, personality is supposed

34
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,370
to be quite stable.

35
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,739
Test retest reliability also assumes that any changes in the responses given by people

36
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,580
in the test are not due to repeated exposure to the same test.

37
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,280
For example, maybe people learn how to do well on the test by doing it the first time

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,300
so they do better on the second time.

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,160
If you completed the same quiz from this course twice, you would probably improve the second

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
time around, just because you’ve learned what the questions are like and how to do better.

41
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,270
Because of these reasons, we need to be cautious when relying on test retest reliability, it’s

42
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,819
also why many tests are protected by professional bodies so that people can’t practice on

43
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:07,319
them.
