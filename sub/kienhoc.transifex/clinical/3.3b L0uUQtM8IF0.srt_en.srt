00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,260
In terms of aetiology, we know that biological factors are important.

1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,280
Genetics are important.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,359
In the general population, approximately 0.5 to 1 percent of people develop Schizophrenia.

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,550
However, if you have a first degree biological relative with schizophrenia––for example,

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,990
a parent or a sibling––the odds of you also developing the disorder go up to around

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,560
10%.

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,960
This jump is certainly suggestive of the importance of shared DNA.

7
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,420
However, the real clincher is twin studies.

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,540
For monozygotic twins––also known as identical twins––where the DNA material is identical,

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,590
if one of the twins develops schizophrenia, the odds of the other twin developing schizophrenia

10
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,180
increase to around 50 percent.

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,690
These are pretty compelling numbers!

12
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,540
Adoption studies have also been important in terms of evidence for genetic transmission.

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,600
By and large, these studies have found that, even if adopted at birth by parents who do

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,869
not have schizophrenia, the biological offspring of a parent with schizophrenia are at increased

15
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,939
odds of developing the disorder relative to the general population.

16
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:22,499
However, in thinking about the twin and adoption research, it is important to keep in mind

17
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:27,409
that genetics do not tell us the whole story of why some people develop schizophrenia and

18
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,990
not others.

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:34,590
If it were simply about genetic influences, in theory we should be looking at a 100% concordance

20
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,939
rate between monozygotic twins, rather than a 50% concordance rate.

21
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:46,119
Genes are hugely important, but increasingly, the biological research is indicating that,

22
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,130
a gene by environment interaction is likely to be the best way of understanding the aetiology

23
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,100
of schizophrenia.

24
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,829
This idea is something I will come back to shortly.

25
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,219
There are a number of other lines of research that support the role of biological factors

26
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,070
in the development of schizophrenia.

27
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,190
People with schizophrenia have been found to have structural brain abnormalities compared

28
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,560
to people who do not have the disorder.

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,340
Biochemical abnormalities––particularly involving the neurotransmitter dopamine––have

30
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,671
also been implicated in the development of schizophrenia, with an individual’s genetic

31
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:25,140
predisposition a probable cause of the chemical imbalance.

32
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,400
Finally, people with schizophrenia are more likely than people without the disorder; to

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,430
have been exposed to pregnancy and birth complications; that may have caused structural damage to

34
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,560
the brain.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,910
So, we’ve looked at biological and genetic factors.

36
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,960
Let’s turn our attention now to environmental factors.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,240
If we think about social factors first, we know that low socioeconomic status or SES,

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,740
is associated with the incidence of schizophrenia.

39
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,590
Having said that, schizophrenia is certainly not restricted to people who have come from

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,650
a lower socioeconomic background; it’s just more likely that people with schizophrenia

41
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,920
will come from a low SES background.

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,080
Some of the potentially harmful characteristics associated with lower SES include stress,

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,350
social isolation, poor nutrition, and lack of access to medical services.

44
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,830
It’s really difficult to disentangle this association between schizophrenia and lower

45
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,460
SES.

46
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,680
Do the stressors associated with living in a lower socioeconomic demographic influence

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,650
the likelihood that an individual will develop schizophrenia?

48
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:43,470
Or, equally possible, does this association exist because, if an individual has schizophrenia,

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,270
they are more likely to end up in a lower socioeconomic demographic, as they’re not

50
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,530
able to hold down a job?

51
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,430
Regardless, we know that if you have schizophrenia, your biological offspring are at increased

52
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,580
risk––relative to the general population––of developing schizophrenia.

53
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:06,200
It’s somewhat unclear as to whether living in a lower socioeconomic demographic adds

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,680
to the risk in this equation.

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,290
A second social factor that has been linked to the incidence of schizophrenia is social

56
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,760
dislocation.

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,780
Higher rates of schizophrenia have been found among people who have migrated to a new country

58
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:25,030
compared to people who have not experienced this kind of social dislocation.

59
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,670
With regard to psychological factors, expressed emotion is the construct that has been most

60
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,200
researched.

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,510
Expressed emotion refers to the level of criticism, hostility, and emotional over-involvement

62
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,040
that exists within a family.

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,220
The research indicates that, people with schizophrenia who live in a family with a high level of

64
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,450
negative expressed emotion; are significantly more likely to relapse compared to those with

65
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,820
schizophrenia living in a family with a low level of negative expressed emotion.

66
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,470
This finding, which has been well-replicated, is important.

67
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,310
However, I think it’s also important to consider the issue of family burden.

68
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,740
Try for a moment to imagine what it would be like to live in a family environment with

69
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,080
someone––a parent, a child, or a sibling––suffering from schizophrenia.

70
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,370
When we are looking at family-related ‘risk’ factors, it’s critical not to fall into

71
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,750
the trap of blaming family members.
