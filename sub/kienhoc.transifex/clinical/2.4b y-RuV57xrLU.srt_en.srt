If we think about the aetiology of anxiety disorders from a cognitive behavioral perspective,

1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,779
the behavioral component is very much informed by Stanley Rachman’s work published in 1977.

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,340
Rachman proposed three pathways through which people might develop fear.

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,300
The first is through their own direct experience, which may become generalised through conditioning.

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,860
So, for example, if you have experienced a dog biting you in the face, you might acquire

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,450
a fear of dogs, which might then generalise to various other animals – or not.

6
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,129
The second pathway is instructional learning, which involves the transmission of information

7
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,079
relating to danger.

8
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,199
For example, when a parent repeatedly warns a child to stay away from pools because people

9
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,079
drown in pools all the time, the child might develop a fear of pools.

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,949
The third pathway that Rachman proposed was vicarious learning.

11
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:04,720
This is when you repeatedly see someone else, usually an important person in your life such

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,560
as a parent, behave fearfully when confronted by a particular stimulus, and then you develop

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,740
that fear yourself.

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,649
So, that is a very behavioural perspective on the ways in which anxiety or fear may develop.

15
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:22,620
Let’s have a look at the kind of cognitive-behavioural model that might be used to explain the way

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,700
anxiety works to a client.

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,040
I’ll talk you through an example – just the way I would with a client – to explain

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,590
how the elements of this model fit together.

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,340
I’ll give you a bit of background information about Sam, the subject of our example.

20
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,229
Imagine that Sam is an only child, the son of quiet, introverted parents.

21
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,119
Growing up in a small country town, he was quite shy and didn’t have many friends.

22
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,299
His parents tended to keep to themselves and the family didn’t socialise very much.

23
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,880
Now Sam is at university and living in college.

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,000
One of the guys on his floor, Pete, asks him if he wants to go to a party.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,640
Sam says yes.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,840
He arrives at the party by himself.

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,600
He gets as far as the open doorway to the house, where he can see people laughing, talking

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,290
and having a good time.

29
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,640
But he can’t see the mate who invited him.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,240
No-one comes to greet Sam.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,870
He thinks to himself, “This is going to be awful.

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,510
I can’t see Pete…actually I can’t see anyone I know.

33
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,230
No-one is going to talk to me and I am going to look like a real loser.

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,390
I wish I had never come”.

35
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,530
This is an example of the cognitive system in action.

36
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,350
As he is saying this to himself, Sam notices that his heart is beating really fast, that

37
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:41,200
his hands have gone all sweaty, and that he has become flushed in the face. All manifestations

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,130
of the physiological system of anxiety.

39
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,290
And here we have a nasty little feedback loop between the physiological and the cognitive

40
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,800
system, because, having noticed his physical symptoms of anxiety, Sam says to himself,

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
“Great.

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,020
Now, everyone is going to be able to see what a nervous wreck I am”.

43
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,280
His feelings of anxiety and uneasiness increase, and eventually, he turns around and leaves

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,620
the party.

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,630
When he leaves (which is the behavioural system of anxiety in action), he is avoiding the

46
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,930
stimulus (the party) and the thoughts that have made him anxious.

47
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,840
The immediate consequence of his avoidance is that Sam’s anxiety reduces.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,590
As he is walking away however, Sam thinks to himself, “Well, I was right.

49
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,500
I couldn’t cope in that situation and it was every bit as awful as I knew it was going

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,770
to be”.

51
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,330
His avoidance has served to reinforce or strengthen his original negative thoughts…and next

52
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,910
time he is invited to a party, Sam is much less likely to accept the invitation.

53
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:52,360
Whether Sam is a 20 year old university student (as in this example), a 65 year old, a 13

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,110
year old, or a 5 year old is irrelevant.

55
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,000
Anxiety works in the same way for adults, adolescents and children.
