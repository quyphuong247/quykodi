0
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,289
So people might experience stress through frustration, by losing something or failing

1
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,340
to achieve a goal.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,060
Another way they can experience stress is through conflict.

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,170
Conflict occurs when two or more incompatible motivations compete for expression.

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,660
A lot of work has being done on work-life balance and how that can produce stress and

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,660
conflict.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,480
There are demands of family life, and the demands of our working lives compete with

7
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,480
that.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,190
Sometimes, both family and work need attention at the same time, so it becomes very difficult

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,060
for people to try to satisfy both sets of demands.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,790
Oftentimes, they can’t.

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:50,940
There are actually three different types of conflict: The approach-approach, the avoidance-avoidance,

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,940
and the approach-avoidance.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,850
We’ll go through some examples to illustrate them.

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,430
The first type is what we call approach-approach type conflict.

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,299
Now all of these conflict types are not equally stressful.

16
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:09,079
The approach-approach type conflict is where you have to choose between two positive alternatives.

17
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,350
You’ve got two competing goals.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,350
I know all of you are not necessarily going to go into Psychology as a career, but for

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,090
the sake of this example, imagine that your goal is to become a Psychologist.

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,990
When you finish your study, you start applying for jobs and you get a letter of offer from

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,250
one place which just so happens to be a ski resort.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,960
They’ve been looking for a psychologist.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,590
If you accept that job, what you’ll be doing is talking to people, giving them some motivational

24
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,220
encouragement about their skiing on the slope, to try more difficult runs and things like

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,460
that, and helping them deal with the disappointment of falling over when they ski.

26
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,920
That won’t take much of your time, so you can have a lot of time to sit in front of

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,270
the fireplace and drink hot chocolates and go skiing yourself as well, and they’ll

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,542
pay you lots of money to do that.

29
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:59,310
There are no jobs like this in psychology, but imagine if there is one.

30
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,159
You’re pretty excited by the possibility of a career on the snow.

31
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,990
But, you receive another letter of offer the next day.

32
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,679
It is from a very exclusive island resort and they want you to run some mindfulness

33
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,900
sessions for the clients who are paying a lot of money.

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,870
You only really have to do a couple of those sessions a day, so you’ve got a lot of time

35
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,980
to sit on the beach, drink daiquiris, and chill out.

36
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,459
They’ll give you lots of money as well.

37
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,000
You’ve got to choose between these two jobs.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,650
Which one do you choose?

39
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,209
Is that a hard choice?

40
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,889
Yes, it is, so it could produce stress.

41
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,260
Why is that stressful?

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,980
You know they are likely to both have VERY positive outcomes.

43
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,209
By choosing one, you lose the positive aspects of the other one.

44
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,559
Also, you don’t know which option would be better.

45
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:51,579
One of them might be slightly more positive than the other, but it’s really hard to

46
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,790
tell.

47
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,430
This is stressful because you’re giving up the positive aspects of the one you didn’t

48
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,430
choose.

49
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,529
And this is what causes the stress.

50
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:03,169
What if the conflict is slightly different?

51
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,109
The second type is what we call avoidance-avoidance type conflict, where we have to choose between

52
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,559
two really unattractive possibilities.

53
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:16,079
Imagine this time you got a very strong phobia of going to the dentist, but at the same time

54
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,749
you’ve noticed over the last week or two that you’ve got a really bad toothache.

55
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:25,639
You can either choose to put up with the toothache and not have to confront going to the dentist—that

56
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,769
means lots of pain, or you can choose to face your fears and go to the dentist.

57
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,339
Both of these are pretty unattractive goals or unattractive outcomes.

58
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:39,769
The reason why this is stressful is because no matter which one you choose, it’s likely

59
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,459
that you won’t enjoy the experience at all.

60
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,229
This is the most stressful type of conflict.

61
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:51,859
Now there’s a third possibility, the approach-avoidance type, and this is NOT about a choice between

62
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,620
two different behaviours.

63
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,529
This is about a choice about whether or not to pursue a goal or a behaviour that has positive

64
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,379
AND negative aspects to it.

65
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,409
For this example, imagine you’re at a really cool party, and you meet somebody for the

66
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:11,839
first time, and your id instantly opens its eyes and says, “This person is super hot.”

67
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:15,709
So your id is really excited about this person, and it’s telling you, you should date this

68
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:16,709
person.

69
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,709
You’ve got to get to know them because you want to date them because they’re so hot.

70
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,160
Now the problem is: even though they’re really hot, you noticed they’ve got some

71
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,280
negative attributes.

72
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,669
They really love Celine Dion!

73
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,629
You have to decide whether to pursue a relationship with them.

74
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,240
A relationship with this person means you get to spend lots of time with somebody who’s

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,449
really hot, but also you’d be listening to Celine Dion.

76
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,819
Or if you decide not to pursue your relationship with them, you don’t have to listen to Celine

77
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,840
Dion, but you miss out on spending time with somebody you think is hot.

78
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,460
You are to accept something positive and also something negative, or you’re choosing to

79
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,360
avoid something negative but then lose something positive.

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,639
The positive and negative aspects make it difficult to choose, and it can produce vacillation

81
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,710
where we decide to pursue the goal and then decide not to pursue the goal at the same

82
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,120
time.
