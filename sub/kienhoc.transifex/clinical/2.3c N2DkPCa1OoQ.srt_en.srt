00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:09,990
Do you ever feel awkward in social situations?

1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,530
Feeling anxious in social situations is very common.

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,900
How do we know when these kinds of anxieties have crossed over into being a disorder?

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,279
The key feature of Social Anxiety Disorder, often referred to as Social Phobia, is fear

4
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,669
or anxiety about or avoidance of social situations and interactions in which there is the possibility

5
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:34,649
of being scrutinised or judged by others.

6
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,969
Common social interactions that might be very anxiety-provoking for someone with this disorder

7
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,320
include: eating in front of others, performing in front of others, or having to meet someone new.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,539
As with Specific Phobia, the feared or avoided situations almost always provoke anxiety;

9
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,550
and are either avoided or endured with extreme anxiety.

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,079
The anxiety must have been present for at least 6 months.

11
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,999
Again, like Specific Phobia, the fear must be out of proportion to the actual threat

12
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:09,350
posed by the social interaction or situation; and must result in either intense distress

13
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,170
and/or significant impairment in functioning.

14
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,990
It is also important that the symptoms are not better explained by either another mental

15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:22,560
illness or the physiological effects of either substance use or a medical condition.

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,670
In Western countries, the 12-month prevalence rate for Social Anxiety Disorder is around

17
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:34,500
7%, and this is roughly the same whether we are talking about adults or children and adolescents.

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,750
Again, we see this disorder more commonly in females â€“ with this gender difference

19
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,700
being slightly larger in adolescents and young adults.

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,070
Onset is between the ages of 8 and 15 years for about 75% of people with this disorder,

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,430
with onset in adulthood being reasonably rare.
