00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,930
What you&#39;ve done as you go through life is made choices.

1
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:18,120
Youâ€™ve chosen to go to university or not, to get married or not, have kids or not, travel or not.

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,820
You have made lifestyle choices, to smoke or not, exercise or not.

3
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,260
You&#39;ve had good and bad things happen to you, maybe a car accident, maybe the experience

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,160
of great success in a career.

5
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,970
So by the time you get to be 80 and you&#39;ve made all these unique choices and had a variety

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:44,829
of things happen to you, then your persona, your brain, your personality, your social

7
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,890
networks, everything, is quite unique.

8
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:56,289
That&#39;s why in the realm of, say, statistics or personality, older adult populations have

9
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,600
a greater standard deviation.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,260
There is no such thing as a typical 70 year old.

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,610
So with increasing age, people get more and more different from each other.

12
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,560
We say there is increased heterogeneity with increasing age.

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,729
And this is the second key gerontology principle.

14
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,880
For this reason older adults are a great population to study because there&#39;s a lot of variance

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,770
in the population.

16
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,710
This is why if you gave a test to a room full of 30 year olds and a room full of 80 year

17
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,700
olds, the 80 year olds would have a much wider range of responses, whether you gave them

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,520
a memory test, or personality test, or even just asked what&#39;s your favourite flavour of

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,930
ice cream.

20
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,729
Time and experience add up to heterogeneity.
