00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,980
It’s a  myth that older people are more likely to

1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,300
be depressed and anxious than younger people.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,839
Actually, the reverse is true, and it is true all over the world, it is not simply a cohort

3
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,019
effect.

4
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:25,079
This has been shown in longitudinal research.

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:31,349
If you saw an elderly patient presenting with memory impairment - would you consider depression

6
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,710
or anxiety?

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,770
Well, in older people, depression and anxiety present differently than when they occur earlier

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,770
in life.

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:47,870
And, in fact, memory impairment is a key presentation in later life for both depression and anxiety.

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,180
Unfortunately, this makes it more likely that older adults will be misdiagnosed with dementia

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,440
when they’re actually suffering from depression or anxiety.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,760
For example, a patient with depression in their later years may talk about feeling less

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,810
able to enjoy their favorite activities, or talk about decreased appetite and weight loss,

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,420
but they will usually emphasize difficulties in remembering common things such as items

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,670
at the grocery store, or a good friend’s telephone number.

16
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:28,509
Key risk factors for depression include: disability, newly diagnosed medical illness, poor health

17
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:35,920
status, poor self-perceived health, prior depression, and bereavement.

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,499
Protective factors include greater perceived social support, regular physical exercise

19
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:46,130
and higher socioeconomic status.

20
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,289
Older adults are less likely to get a thorough diagnostic work-up and are less likely to

21
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:56,759
be offered the widest range of treatment options compared to younger adults.

22
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,849
This is true for both physical and mental illness.

23
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,130
This is really bad.

24
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:09,090
Currently we have good interventions for depression in later life, either psychotherapy, pharmacological

25
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,370
treatments, or a combination of the two, which are effective in about 80% of cases.

26
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,390
But there are currently no treatments which can slow or reverse dementia.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,750
You should be aware that some studies have found that as high as 20% of cases of dementia,

28
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:34,190
at autopsy, turn out to have been likely misdiagnosed - and are more likely cases of depression.

29
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:40,140
So a good diagnostic work-up is most important.

30
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,900
Anxiety is actually more common later in life when compared to the incidence of depression

31
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,990
in later life.

32
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:52,330
Many risk factors are the same for both anxiety and depression.

33
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,850
Key risk factors for anxiety include poor self-rated general health status, physical

34
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,500
or sexual abuse in childhood, and being a current smoker.

35
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,790
Protective factors include greater perceived social support, regular physical exercise,

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,870
and higher level of education.

37
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:21,140
Both socioeconomic status and education are really reflective of economic resources.

38
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,420
And research shows greater resources confer greater protection against both depression

39
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,630
and anxiety, at all ages.

40
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,700
Also, almost anything that you could do to support a healthy lifestyle in your younger

41
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,030
years will be protective against mental and physical illness in later life.
