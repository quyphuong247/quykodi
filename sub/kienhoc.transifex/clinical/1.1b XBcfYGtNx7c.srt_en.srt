00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,020
So, of the different advice and comments given in the video, which, if any, do you think

1
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,980
is actually likely to be helpful to a person suffering from depression?

2
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,570
The advice about exercising is actually the only piece of advice that has any real merit

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,480
in helping someone experiencing depression, with research having shown that exercise can

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,300
be related to decreased symptoms of depression.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,430
The rest of the advice is actually unlikely to be helpful.

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,820
Iâ€™d go further and suggest that, at least some of that advice might actually make someone

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,430
who is depressed feel even worse.

8
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,830
This is important because these comments are exactly the sorts of things that well-intentioned

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,230
people say to people suffering from depression or other kinds of mental illness.
