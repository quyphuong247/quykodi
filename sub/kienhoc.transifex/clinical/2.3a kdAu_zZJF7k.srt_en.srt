00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,290
Do you ever get anxious or worried?

1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,290
Of course you do!

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,520
We all do.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,320
So before we go any further, I just want to emphasise the fact that anxiety is a normal

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,430
part of being human.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,110
Everybody gets anxious.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,720
Everybody experiences fear and anxiety from time to time.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,220
That&#39;s normal…

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,840
But it means we have something of a dilemma when it comes to diagnosing anxiety disorders

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,820
– because exactly how do you distinguish between anxiety that falls within the broad

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,160
parameters of normal, and anxiety that has become clinically significant?

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,680
Well, if a person’s anxiety is causing them a great deal of distress and/or it&#39;s really

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,829
interfering with their functioning, then we would view it as being clinically significant.

13
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:57,820
So, it comes down to these two key constructs – distress caused, and associated impairment

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,220
or interference in functioning.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,270
I’ll give you an example to demonstrate what I mean.

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,580
Many to most of us might experience anxiety about, having to give a talk, or sit an exam;

17
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,320
but generally speaking, we&#39;re able to manage that and do the talk, or sit the exam.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,310
However, if your anxiety is so great that you&#39;re not able to do the talk or sit the

19
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:25,400
exam - then that’s starting to sound like clinically significant anxiety as it is interfering

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,720
with your functioning.

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,930
As with the depressive disorders, there are a number of DSM-5 anxiety disorders.

22
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,159
These include:

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,530
Separation Anxiety Disorder, Selective Mutism,

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,650
Specific Phobia, Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia),

25
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,650
Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia,

26
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,650
Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder,

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,280
Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Other Specified Anxiety Disorder,

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,560
Unspecified Anxiety Disorder.

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,400
We are going to focus on Specific Phobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder and

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,149
Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

31
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,250
Before we talk about each of these disorders, I want to introduce the idea of the 3 systems

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,689
of anxiety – the cognitive system (what people think either before, during or after

33
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:25,159
a situation where they feel anxious), the behavioural system (what people do when they

34
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,840
are anxious) and the physiological system (what happens in people’s bodies when they

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
are anxious).

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,359
We’ll come back to this idea at the end when we talk about a cognitive behavioural

37
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:35,450
model of anxiety.
