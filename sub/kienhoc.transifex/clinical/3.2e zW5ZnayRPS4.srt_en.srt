It’s very difficult – perhaps even impossible to imagine living every day experiencing what

1
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,849
someone living with schizophrenia experiences.

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,130
Another positive symptom set of schizophrenia is grossly disorganised behaviour or disturbances

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,739
in motor activity.

4
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,220
This set of symptoms can manifest in many different ways.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,740
For example, a person’s behaviour might be characterised by childish silliness or

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,840
a complete lack of focus.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,430
Other examples include:

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,640
Psychomotor agitation, such as restlessness and an inability to stay still.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,300
Or, excessive purposeless activity that is unrelated to anything going on in the environment – for

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,940
instance, twirling round and round on the spot.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,660
Or you might see self-initiated bizarre postures, such as standing bent at the waist with one arm stuck up in

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,770
the air.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,350
Finally, you might see a complete lack of response to all stimuli – for example, not responding when someone

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,260
talks to you, prods you and so on..

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,179
Catatonia refers to neurogenic motor immobility, or behavioural abnormality manifested as stupor.

16
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:16,899
This is where people can literally become rigid in their movement and become immobile.

17
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:18,979
Catatonia is not particularly common.
