00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,660
So, are intelligence tests reliable and valid?

1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,790
Intelligence tests are some of the most reliable tests that we have.

2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,560
It was the intelligence movement that really focused on the psychometric properties of

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,679
tests, and so there&#39;s been a very clear focus on improving the reliability of tests.

4
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,331
When you look at the correlation between scores people receive on intelligence tests at two

5
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:35,440
different times, test-retest reliability, the average correlation is around 0.85.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,710
It can be higher, but 0.85 is the average correlation.

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,870
For a range of different tests, having an average correlation of 0.85 would generally

8
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,140
be considered as good.

9
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,609
With regard to validity, asking the question: “Do intelligence tests measure the things

10
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,249
that we think they measure?”

11
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:56,719
When you compare the performance on intelligence tests to things like performance or success

12
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,449
at school, so that&#39;s criterion validity, what we see here is the correlation anywhere between

13
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,729
0.4 and 0.75.

14
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,170
At the upper bounds of 0.75, that&#39;s very good.

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,930
At the lower bounds of 0.4, that&#39;s moderate.

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,500
So, intelligence tests generally seem to measure the things that we think they measure.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,200
If someone does get a high IQ score, what does that tell us?

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,350
It doesn&#39;t tell us that they&#39;re a good person, or moral, or anything like that, or that they’re

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,549
going to have success in life.

20
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,040
What it tells us is something about their cognitive ability and how likely they are

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,810
going to do well at tasks that require cognitive ability.

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,509
That&#39;s all an IQ score tells us.

23
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:41,619
Having a good IQ isn&#39;t necessarily the only recipe for success.

24
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,579
It&#39;s only part of the picture.

25
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:49,229
It tells us about someone’s cognitive ability, but a lot of other things contribute to success.
