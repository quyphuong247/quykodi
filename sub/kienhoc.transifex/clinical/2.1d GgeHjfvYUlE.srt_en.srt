Who grew up with Winnie the Pooh and his friends?

1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,720
For those of you who did, you&#39;d be very familiar with this character.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,490
For those of you who didn&#39;t, this guy here – Eeyore the donkey – is arguably a very

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,840
good example of someone experiencing Dysthymia.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,090
Eeyore is your classic pessimist.

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,530
There was never a bright side to anything for Eeyore, and the glass was always half

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,199
empty.

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,100
Persistent Depressive Disorder or Dysthymia is like a much more chronic, but lower grade

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,010
intensity version of major depressive disorder.

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,640
Having said that, it’s really important to emphasise that the impact of this disorder

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,070
on an individual can be as significant, or even more significant than the impact of Major

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,150
Depressive Disorder.

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,050
You&#39;ll notice that the symptoms for Persistent Depressive Disorder are very similar to the

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,979
symptoms for a Major Depressive episode.

14
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:01,900
In order to meet criteria for this disorder, a person needs to demonstrate depressed mood

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,960
for most of the day, more days than not, for at least two years.

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,280
For children and adolescents, the duration criterion is 1 year rather than 2.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
In addition, people need to display two symptoms from this list:

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
poor appetite or overeating; insomnia or hypersomnia;

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,009
low energy or fatigue; low self-esteem;

20
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:29,680
poor concentration or problems making decisions; and a sense of hopelessness.

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,420
This disorder in DSM-5 is an amalgamation of 2 DSM-IV disorders – Dysthymic Disorder

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,729
and Chronic Major Depressive episode.

23
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,859
So, with this illness, we are looking at a more chronic, less intense––in terms of

24
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,329
the number of symptoms required––version of Major Depressive Disorder.
