00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,110
One of the early stages of the therapeutic process, before treatment actually begins,

1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,410
is the process of formulation.

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,911
This should be a collaborative activity involving both the clinician and the client; and it

3
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:22,410
is focused on using the information that has been gathered through the assessment phase

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,449
to understand why a client is presenting with a particular problem or set of issues at this

5
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,080
point in time.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,960
Your formulation reflects your shared understanding of how the difficulties have developed and

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,820
how they are being maintained over time.

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,100
There are many different models that can be used in formulation.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,329
The behavioural model is grounded in the principles of operant conditioning and is known as a

10
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,460
SORCK analysis.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,870
The SORCK analysis was developed by Kanfer and Saslow in 1969.

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,379
It allows the clinician and client to look at the pattern of relationships between the

13
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,380
antecedent stimuli and the problematic responses, and to understand why the responses are being

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,950
maintained over time.

15
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,610
The easiest place to start in looking at a SORCK analysis is the response column.

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,810
The response column contains the specific behaviours that make up the presenting problem.

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,970
Some of the specific behaviours listed in this SORCK analysis include: verbally abusing

18
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,790
mum, jabbing a corkscrew at mum and swearing.

19
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,320
The next place we go is the stimulus column.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,850
The things that are listed under this heading are essentially triggers for the problematic

21
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,020
responses or behaviours.

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,930
There are three sub-headings.

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,869
The first one is historical.

24
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:38,920
Historical stimuli have a bearing on the likelihood of whether or not the behaviour is going to

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,870
occur but they don’t directly elicit the behaviour.

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,340
Historical stimuli can include something that happened earlier that day, but also things

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,040
that relate to the distant past.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,820
For Jamie, the things that are under this heading are that he was a “difficult”

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,560
baby in his mum’s words, and that he has a history of long-term difficulties with aggression

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
and compliance.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,920
Now the second heading is contextual––stimuli that are occurring concurrently with the problematic

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,250
response, increase the likelihood of its occurrence but don’t directly trigger or elicit the

33
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,250
response.

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,950
One of the most relevant contextual stimuli for Jamie is his exposure to violent films.

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,840
The last heading in the Stimulus column is immediate.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,120
Under this heading we find the stimuli that occur immediately before the problem behaviour

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,930
and directly trigger its occurrence.

38
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,480
For Jamie, the immediate stimulus is that his mum asks him to do his homework.

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,870
The second column refers to the Organismic variables.

40
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,910
These are variables that influence the relationship between the antecedent stimuli and the response;

41
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,640
and that are characteristic of the current state of the individual.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,319
Organismic variables may include cognitive functioning, drug use, emotions, and physical

43
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,830
health problems.

44
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,830
For Jamie, the only thing that is relevant here is that he struggles with regulating

45
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,690
or managing his emotions.

46
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,430
The next place we go is the consequence column, and what belongs here is what happens after

47
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,940
the problem behaviour or response.

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,780
It is important to think about this question from the perspective of each person involved

49
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,959
in the interaction – in this case, Jamie and his mum, Christine.

50
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,920
First, we have immediate consequences.

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,120
These are the stimuli that occur straight after the problem response and that changes

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,540
the likelihood of the response occurring in the future.

53
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,120
What happens for both mum and for Jamie?

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,220
Jamie is given multiple instructions to stop.

55
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,980
Mum tells the sister to leave the room in order to protect her.

56
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,520
Mum tries to physically contain Jamie and wrestles the corkscrew from him.

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,860
Mum then physically removes Jamie to his bedroom.

58
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,450
Once there, she offers him a trip to the local DVD store for short bread if he can be a good

59
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,670
boy.

60
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,400
In the course of all of this, the original trigger for the behaviour – the instruction

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,989
to do his homework – is forgotten.

62
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,290
We also have to think about the delayed or longer-term consequences of the problem responses.

63
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,400
These are stimuli that are caused by the target behaviour in the longer-term.

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,049
They are not immediate consequences and they don’t directly influence the likelihood

65
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,420
of the problem response occurring in the future.

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,060
Delayed consequences do however influence contextual variables that may be indirectly

67
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,690
related to the recurrence of the behaviour.

68
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,030
In our example, possible delayed consequences include mum feeling out of control and ineffective

69
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,570
as a parent, mum feeling fearful of Jamie, and deterioration in the relationship between

70
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,630
Jamie and his mum.

71
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,530
The contingency column.

72
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,770
This is basically where we do our thinking in terms of the principles of operant conditioning,

73
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,410
about how the behaviour or response and its consequences are related to each other.

74
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,970
It’s where we try to understand what function the behaviors are serving.

75
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,310
In the short-term, Jamie is getting a lot of attention for his misbehaviour.

76
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,360
This extra attention is a positive reinforcement for Jamie’s behaviour.

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,690
Towards the end of the clip, having gotten Jamie to his bedroom, mum asks Jamie if he

78
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,470
can be a good boy.

79
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,280
This feels like a well-worn routine – Jamie’s voice quietens and he quickly agrees to be

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,770
a good boy.

81
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,390
When mum then promises him that they can get some shortbread, Jamie’s

82
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,630
behaviour is positively reinforced because this is a treat food.

83
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,000
From mum’s perspective, her behaviour of offering the treat in exchange for Jamie behaving

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,820
better is also reinforced – but negatively – as his behaviour very briefly settles.

85
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,389
In other words, stimuli that are aversive for mum – namely Jamie’s swearing and

86
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,240
hitting – have reduced.

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,220
This – however short-lived – is a good outcome for mum.

88
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,720
Ultimately, Jamie also misses out on having to do his homework , which is a good outcome

89
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,820
for him and represents another example of negative reinforcement.

90
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,380
Jamie has been both positively and negatively reinforced for engaging in a range of problematic

91
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,569
behaviours, and is more likely to do all of them again in the future.

92
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,139
In terms of the long-term consequences, if mum feels out of control as a parent, and

93
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:15,880
fearful of her son, this is likely to influence her day to day relationship with Jamie, and

94
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,830
most likely in a negative way.

95
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,800
Over time, the relationship between Jamie and his mum is highly likely to deteriorate,

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,509
which will then become an important contextual stimulus for future problem behaviours.
