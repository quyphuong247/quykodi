00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,960
The next symptom set of schizophrenia is hallucinations, which are disturbances of perception.

1
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,840
When a person experiences hallucinations, they are having a false sensory experience.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,570
They believe that they are experiencing something through one of the five senses when in fact

3
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,310
they are not.

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,359
Hallucinations, like delusions, are typically very distressing for the people who experience

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,510
them, because the experience––whether it involves hearing, seeing or feeling something

6
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,540
that is not really there––feels every bit as real as if it was actually happening.

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,460
For people with schizophrenia, by far the most common sensory modality in which hallucinations

8
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,300
are experienced is the auditory sense.

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,100
Auditory referring to what we hear.

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,729
The most common type of auditory hallucination that people with schizophrenia experience

11
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,410
is hearing voices.

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,360
Typically, when a person is experiencing auditory hallucinations and hearing voices, the voices

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,600
are very derogatory and negative about the person in question.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,860
A person may hear one or more voices, but generally, they’re saying awful, mean things

15
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,220
to the person – for example, “he’s worthless”, &quot;he&#39;s useless&quot;.

16
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,360
It’s very unusual for the voices to say anything positive about the person experiencing

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,540
them.

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,170
In many years of working as a clinical psychologist, I’ve only ever met one person who experienced

19
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,540
voices that were benign––that said nice things to her.

20
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,390
Sometimes, when a person says they are hearing voices, they are actually talking about their

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,060
own thoughts, or internal monologue.

22
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,659
The key difference between thoughts and an auditory hallucination in the form of ‘a

23
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,000
voice’ is whether the individual feels that the words being spoken are coming from inside

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,910
or outside of their own mind.

25
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,030
Generally speaking, people are able to be quite clear on this issue.

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,520
If the words or voices are coming from inside your mind, we’re usually talking about a

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
thought or self-talk.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,860
Whereas, if the words or voices are coming externally, as though someone else is talking

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,920
to you, we’re usually talking about an auditory hallucination.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,780
Although auditory hallucinations are the most common form of hallucinations, these false

31
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,200
sensory experiences can occur in any of the other senses.

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,340
Visual hallucinations refer to the experience of seeing something that is not actually there.

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,171
Importantly, if a client tells you that they are experiencing visual hallucinations, you

34
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:40,720
need to keep in mind that visual hallucinations can be a product of organic brain disease.

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Actually, this possibility – an organic cause – needs to be kept in mind for any

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,270
type of hallucination.

37
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:57,569
So, the possibility of an organic cause needs to be ruled out very early on.

38
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,770
Even if other aspects of the person’s presentation are consistent with a psychotic illness, we

39
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:08,960
need to exclude organic causes, by referring the client for an MRI or whatever other investigation

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
is appropriate.

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,380
It is possible for somebody with schizophrenia to experience visual hallucinations, but you

42
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,920
need to exclude organic causes first before attributing it to schizophrenia.

43
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,850
Olfactory hallucinations involve the sense of smell – so this is where someone has

44
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,020
the experience of smelling something that in fact is not there.

45
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,660
One example that stands out for me over the years is a 27-year-old woman who had a very

46
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,340
distressing olfactory hallucination, whereby she would quite frequently experience the

47
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,060
smell of burning human flesh.

48
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,150
Gustatory hallucinations involve the sense of taste.

49
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,030
So, when a person experiences a gustatory hallucination, they have the experience of

50
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,489
tasting something that they are not actually tasting.

51
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,349
A common example is the experience that the food you are eating tastes rotten when it

52
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,690
tastes fine to others who are eating the same food.

53
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,090
Finally, a tactile hallucination refers to a false sensory experience in relation to

54
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,099
the sense of touch.

55
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,739
When a person has a tactile hallucination, there is the sense of physical contact with

56
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,349
a stimulus that is not real.

57
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:22,949
One of the most common tactile hallucinations is the experience of something crawling on

58
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,080
or under your skin.

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,729
For example, maggots or cockroaches.
