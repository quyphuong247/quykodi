00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,440
Worldwide, the current number of people estimated to be living with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and

1
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,430
dementia stands at between 27 million and 36 million (WHO, 2011), with increasing financial

2
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,700
and social costs.

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:27,350
It is important to note that these costs are not distributed equally across the globe.

4
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:33,230
Two thirds of people with dementia are estimated to be living in the developing world, where

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,820
access to diagnosis and treatment is underdeveloped.

6
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,079
Even research and research dollars track these discrepancies.

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:50,870
The 10/66 Dementia Research Group takes its name from the fact that 10% or less of population-based

8
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:58,180
research on dementia has been carried out on the two thirds, or 66%, of people with

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,600
dementia living in low- and middle-income countries.

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,060
Dementia is the most common age-related cognitive condition among Aboriginal peoples worldwide.

11
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,200
Research on indigenous populations is required if psychological assessment and treatment

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,600
approaches are to be culturally sensitive and appropriate, as well as effective and

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
accurate.

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,049
The need for such culturally specific tools and approaches is certainly acute in older

15
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,649
Aboriginal populations, as is the need for an understanding of indigenous conceptions

16
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:37,679
of aging and age-related illnesses and issues.

17
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:45,520
In many countries, including Canada and Australia, consultation, collaboration and input from

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,680
indigenous peoples and indigenous mental health workers have resulted in better tools to diagnose

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,079
dementia in these populations.

20
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,079
Similarly, educating indigenous dementia caregivers has led to improved home-based and nursing

21
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,659
home care for indigenous persons.

22
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,500
However, this is an area where increased research is needed.
