00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,210
If you grew up during the Great Depression, you may not have had enough food, and that

1
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,880
may make you cautious of wasting food.

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,050
Your family may not have had enough money, and so that could colour your view of resources

3
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,730
or how you want to spend your money.

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,120
You may have very different views or behaviours compared to individuals who grew up in a time

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,550
of relative abundance where such choices were not as critical.

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,970
These kinds of behaviours or perspectives common to a particular population, is called

7
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,270
a cohort effect.

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,900
Itâ€™s when people who have been born in a certain period of time and gone through a

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,940
certain set of experiences will tend to share a relatively similar outlook.

10
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,550
This is the third key gerontology principle.

11
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,190
And it is important when, for example, you pose a question to people of two different

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,220
generations, two different cohorts, such as, &quot;How do you think you should spend your money?&quot;

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,300
The older people say, &quot;I don&#39;t like to spend my money,&quot; and the younger people say, &quot;I

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,360
do like to spend my money.&quot;

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,640
People will say, &quot;That&#39;s because older people don&#39;t like to spend their money,&quot; but that&#39;s

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,060
not true.

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,920
It&#39;s a cohort effect.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,260
It has to do with what that generation experienced, not their age.

19
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,330
You cannot attribute things to aging if you just pick different age groups and give them

20
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,130
the same task.

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:43,660
The best way to answer questions about changes in people over time, with age, is to do a

22
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,610
longitudinal study.

23
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:53,510
It asks the same people questions over time, measures changes in physiology or behaviour

24
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,940
over many years of time.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:02,640
This helps show what is and is not affected by ageing, and what phenomena may be due to

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,740
cohort effects.
