So, what is it that causes personality?

1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,050
There are three things that personality researchers have thought might cause personality.

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,409
One of them is genetic factors, the things you inherit from your parents so some sort

3
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:20,239
of biological factor.

4
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,159
Another is shared environmental factors.

5
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:27,160
An example of this would be, if two kids grow up in the same home, maybe they have similar

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,869
personalities because they have the same experiences.

7
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:34,720
Then, there&#39;s non-shared environmental factors that might make people different.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,930
If one sibling goes to one school and one goes to another school, that might contribute

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,910
to different experiences, and so they might have some variation in personality.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,910
Now, for the most of the 20th century, people thought that the main thing that contributed

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,430
to personality was shared environmental factors.

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,640
How can we tell, though, whether it&#39;s environmental factors or genetic factors given that when

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,329
you&#39;ve got siblings who grow up together, they share an environment and genes?

14
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,210
It makes it complicated to pull those two things apart.
