00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,460
Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks.

1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,100
Panic attacks, which are the building blocks of panic disorder, are defined in the DSM-5

2
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:25,140
as ‘an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes’.

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,000
A panic attack involves four or more of the following symptoms, which, as you will note,

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,910
are mainly physiological sensations:

5
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,610
Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.

6
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,940
Sweating.

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,890
Trembling or shaking.

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,719
Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,239
Feelings of choking.

10
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,489
Chest pain or discomfort.

11
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,929
Nausea or abdominal distress.

12
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,120
Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,800
Chills or heat sensations.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,170
Paresthesias - which is numbness or tingling sensations.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,970
Derealization - which is feelings of unreality, or depersonalization - being detached from

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,530
oneself.

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,730
Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,970
Fear of dying.

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,830
To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, at least one panic attack must have been followed

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,590
by at least a month of either or both of the following:

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,510
Persistent anticipatory anxiety or concern about having another attack or the consequences

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,580
of having an attack.;

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,760
A significant and problematic behavioural change related to the attack, for example,

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,970
avoiding any form of exercise because the person believes that exercise might induce

25
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,530
a panic attack.

26
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,860
Let me just explain what we mean when we talk about anxiety about having an attack, or the

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,250
consequences of having an attack.

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,530
Generally, this anxiety relates to the tendency of people with Panic Disorder to misinterpret

29
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,880
the physical symptoms they are experiencing.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,920
For almost all of us, when we become anxious, we experience physiological symptoms of anxiety.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,450
Some people get sweaty palms, other experience a racing heart, or a sense of nausea.

32
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,840
Trembling is also common.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,490
Each of these physical responses is a normal physiological sign of anxiety – they are

34
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,430
also symptoms of a panic attack.

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,470
When a person is having a panic attack, and they notice that their heart is beating faster

36
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,730
than usual, they don’t think to themselves “the reason my heart is racing is that I’m

37
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,730
anxious”.

38
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,040
Instead, they think to themselves &quot; my heart is beating so fast.

39
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,630
I must be having a heart attack.”

40
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:47,660
So, the physiological symptoms that are literally part of the definition of this disorder tend

41
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,480
to be interpreted in a catastrophic way in terms of physical health.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Another common misinterpretation that people with Panic Disorder make is to think that

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,030
their symptoms mean they are going crazy or losing control.

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,890
As with the other anxiety disorders, we have exclusion criteria to ensure that the symptoms

45
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,040
of Panic Disorder are not better accounted for by either another mental illness or the

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,560
physiological effects of substance use or a medical condition.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,380
Typically, by the time somebody with panic disorder ends up seeing a mental health professional,

48
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,280
they have done the rounds in terms of various medical specialists.

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,349
Often, people with panic disorder are pretty unhappy to be seeing a mental health professional.

50
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,920
I’ve had people say to me, “I’m here because my GP insisted.

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,630
Just because the cardiologists couldn’t find the problem, they all think that my symptoms

52
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,020
aren’t real – that they’re in my head and I need therapy.

53
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
I don’t need therapy.

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,420
I need a good cardiologist!”.

55
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,970
One important point to emphasise about this is that, with panic disorder, the physical

56
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,500
symptoms are real.

57
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,470
The problem is in how the person is making sense of the physical symptoms.

58
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:02,810
In terms of the 12-month prevalence, we are looking at around a 2-3 rate across adolescents

59
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,360
and adults.

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,420
Panic disorder is not commonly seen in children and is diagnosed about twice as often in females

61
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,020
as in males.
