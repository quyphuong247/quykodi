00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,180
Now, the last question we have to ask is whether a test is biased or not.

1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,019
Test bias is the extent to which everybody has the same chances to do well on the test.

2
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:19,820
Depending on the culture people come from, not everyone will have the same chance of

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,489
doing well on a test.

4
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:26,160
If a test has been developed in one culture and it&#39;s administered in another, people from

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,029
a different culture to the culture where the test was developed may be at a disadvantage.

6
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:36,660
If the test is an intelligence test, it&#39;s not because people from a different culture

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,610
are less intelligent than those from the culture where the test was developed.

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,200
It&#39;s because the test is biased to the people from one cultural background compared to another.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,920
Age differences could also be an example of this.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,250
If we’ve developed an intelligence test for adults and used it with children, children

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,920
would do worse than adults.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,990
This is not because children are not as intelligent as adults.

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,190
It&#39;s just that the test is biased towards adults.

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,939
In the next activity, I’m going to ask you two questions that are designed to assess

15
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:06,799
your intelligence.
