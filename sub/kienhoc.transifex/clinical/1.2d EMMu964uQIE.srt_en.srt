00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,360
By the 1920s, other behaviourists were becoming influential, proposing new forms of learning

1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,460
other than classical conditioning.

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,740
The most important of these was BF Skinner.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,300
Skinner believed that it was more productive to study observable behaviour rather than

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,540
to speculate about internal mental events.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,750
He also proposed that classical conditioning was too simplistic to be a complete explanation

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,010
of all human behaviour.

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,960
Skinner believed that the best way to understand behaviour was to look at the causes of an

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,290
action and its consequences.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,710
He called this approach operant conditioning.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,079
Although Skinner is regarded as the father of operant conditioning, his work was based

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,379
on Thorndike’s Law of Effect.

12
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:52,430
Skinner introduced a new term into the Law of Effect – reinforcement.

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,510
Behaviour that is reinforced tends to be repeated or strengthened, and behaviour that is not

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,359
reinforced tends to die out, be extinguished, or, weakened.

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,030
Skinner studied operant conditioning by conducting experiments using animals which he placed

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,670
in a Skinner Box.

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,020
The Skinner box had a lever on the side and an electric grid on the floor.

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,980
Skinner showed how positive reinforcement worked by placing a hungry rat into his box.

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,160
As the rat moved around the box, it would accidentally knock the lever on the side.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,280
Immediately this happened, a food pellet would drop into a container next to the lever.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,610
The rats quickly learned to move straight to the lever after a few times of being put

22
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,020
in the box.

23
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,220
The consequence of receiving food if they pressed the lever ensured that they would

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,670
repeat the action again and again.

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,670
The removal of an unpleasant stimulus can also strengthen behaviour.

26
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,580
This is known as negative reinforcement because it is the removal of an adverse stimulus,

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,860
which is ‘rewarding’ to the animal or person.

28
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,810
Negative reinforcement strengthens behaviour because it stops or removes an unpleasant

29
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,500
experience.

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,750
Skinner showed this by subjecting the rats in his Skinner box to an unpleasant electric

31
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,920
current.

32
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,450
As the rat moved around inside the box, it would accidentally knock the lever.

33
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,810
Immediately after the rat knocked the lever, the electric current would be switched off.

34
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,600
The rats quickly learned that knocking the lever switched off the electric current.

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,090
The consequence of escaping the electric current ensured that they would repeat the action

36
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,190
again and again.

37
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,770
This is known as escape learning.

38
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,210
In fact, Skinner even taught the rats to avoid the electric current by turning on a light

39
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,020
just before the electric current came on.

40
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,660
The rats soon learned to press the lever when the light came on because they had learned

41
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,930
this would stop the electric current from being activated.

42
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,570
This is known as Avoidance Learning.

43
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,970
Punishment is the opposite of reinforcement since it is designed to weaken or eliminate

44
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,950
a response rather than increase it.

45
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,030
It is an aversive event that decreases the behaviour it follows.

46
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,810
Like reinforcement, punishment can work by either directly applying an unpleasant stimulus…

47
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:18,100
like a shock, after a behaviour; or by removing a potentially rewarding stimulus, for example

48
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,700
reducing a child’s screen time, to punish undesirable behaviour.

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,340
Let’s talk about Operant conditioning in our everyday learning.

50
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,900
I’ll preface this example by saying that I am a totally lame joke-teller.

51
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,850
But let’s just say I didn’t have the insight to realise that I’m a bad joke-teller, and

52
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,980
I decide to tell a group of friends a joke at a dinner party.

53
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,112
Now, if most of them laugh at my joke, as opposed to feeling embarrassed, it would be

54
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,560
a good outcome for me.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,610
It’s likely that I will tell that joke again.

56
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,550
If my friends laugh at my joke, my behaviour of telling a joke is being positively reinforced,

57
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,959
and I’m more likely to engage in the same behaviour in the future.

58
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,099
On the other hand, if I tell my joke, and everybody is silent, and we just all look

59
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,260
at each other and go…

60
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,790
“This is awkward!”, that would be a really bad outcome for me.

61
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,650
If I’ve got any sense, I’ll ditch it and not do it again.

62
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,190
This is operant conditioning at work, and it’s one of the key processes by which we

63
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,190
learn.

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,470
We engage in a behavior, it elicits certain sets of consequences for us; and the consequences

65
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,130
make it more or less likely that we will repeat that behaviour in the future.
