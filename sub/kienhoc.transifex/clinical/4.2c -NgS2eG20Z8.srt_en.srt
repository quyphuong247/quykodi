00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,260
So, how do we effectively deal with stress?

1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,911
How do we avoid getting to the stage of exhaustion, and experience the negative consequences that

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,160
are associated with long-term stress?

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,800
Behavioural responses to stress are an individual’s active efforts to master, reduce, or tolerate

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,979
the demands created by stress.

5
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:30,819
Here is a list of the different behaviours someone might engage in to cope with stress.

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,629
Some of these behaviours are adaptive, while others are maladaptive.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,980
Let’s take a look at this list, and try to decide which ones are adaptive and which

8
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,219
are the maladaptive.

9
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,309
Is blaming oneself adaptive or maladaptive?...

10
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,560
It’s definitely maladaptive.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,880
Now, the important question here is: Why is giving up on something and blaming oneself

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,149
maladaptive?

13
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:59,040
Why is doing badly in something and saying to yourself “Ah, I’m terrible at this”

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,600
maladaptive?

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,320
This is maladaptive because it means that next time, it’s likely that you’re not

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,420
going to do any better because you accept the setback and blame yourself.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,750
It’s likely that you won’t do anything different, and so will make the same mistakes

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,140
next time.

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,670
As a result, it’s likely that you will experience more stress.

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,070
Therefore, giving up on something and blaming oneself is maladaptive.

21
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,509
What about striking out at others?

22
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,590
Sometimes this is called catharsis.

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,020
For example, you have a bad day at university or work.

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,271
You go home and yell at whoever is home at the time.

25
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,210
Or maybe you lash out at them and actually hit them.

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,030
They haven’t done anything wrong.

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,810
You just sort of snap at them.

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,630
People sometimes think catharsis is a good way to deal with anger.

29
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,979
Is it a good way to deal with stress?

30
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,530
Should you just let it out rather than bottling it all up?

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,109
Snapping at someone will probably make this other person feel stressed.

32
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,810
It is likely to damage your interpersonal relationship with this other person.

33
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,580
It can actually bring about more stress, particularly if you punch someone.

34
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,020
There are a whole bunch of consequences for punching people that can produce more stress.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,950
So lashing out at others doesn’t seem to reduce stress.

36
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,380
It’s not a very adaptive way to deal with stress.

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,410
What about indulging oneself?

38
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,140
For example, you get to the end of the exam period.

39
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,690
You’ve been super stressed, so you decide, “You know what, I deserve a treat,” so

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,750
you do something to indulge yourself.

41
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,660
Maybe eat a lot of cupcakes or go and buy that big TV that you didn’t think you could

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,660
afford before.

43
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,500
But, “What the heck?”

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,590
You think to yourself, “life has been really stressful, so, I should just buy a big TV,

45
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,160
and that’s going to make things better.”

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,640
Maybe, rather than buying a big TV or eating cupcakes, you decide to go to the pub and

47
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,160
drink a whole bunch of beer or smoke a whole bunch of cigarettes.

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,890
Is indulging yourself a good way to deal with stress?

49
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,600
Is it adaptive?

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,310
No, not really.

51
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,310
It’s fun!

52
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,090
But, the problem is, if you overeat, drink too much beer, or smoke a bunch of cigarettes,

53
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,560
you’ll then have health-related consequences to deal with afterwards.

54
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,950
Drinking excessively can produce a whole range of health problems, and so can smoking cigarettes.

55
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,860
Buying that big TV, thinking you should just reward yourself, isn’t going to make you

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,560
unhealthy necessarily—the problem with that is that you didn’t buy it before because

57
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,170
it was too expensive.

58
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,060
However, when you’re stressed out, your impulse control is impaired, and so you buy

59
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,890
the TV even though you STILL can’t afford it.

60
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,980
As a result, you end up with the financial stress of paying back the credit card to pay

61
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,770
for the TV.

62
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,540
Therefore, indulging yourself can lead to a range of additional stresses that actually

63
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,910
increase stress rather than decreasing it.

64
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,230
What about defensive coping?

65
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,450
This is my cat, Bob.

66
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,010
He’s hiding from the kids, and engaging in some defensive coping.

67
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,350
What that means is he’s pretending as though whatever is stressing him doesn’t exist.

68
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,760
So, shielding himself from the strong negative reactions associated with the stressor.

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,910
Is that adaptive or maladaptive?

70
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,680
This is actually a tricky one, because sometimes it’s adaptive, and sometimes it’s maladaptive.

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,530
It’s maladaptive if this is the only way for you to cope.

72
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,510
Part of the reason for that is that by shielding yourself from the negative reactions to stress,

73
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,630
you miss opportunities for actually dealing with the stressor.

74
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,570
However, it can be positive if it’s done in the context of another type of coping,

75
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,029
such as constructive coping.
