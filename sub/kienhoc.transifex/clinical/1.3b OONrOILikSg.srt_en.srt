00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,179
So what would we do with a family like Christine and Jamie?

1
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,769
We would teach Christine to manage the aggressive behaviours that she doesn’t like.

2
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:16,770
But equally, we would be asking her to think about exactly what it is that she does want

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,440
Jamie to do in the situations where they are currently struggling.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,090
This is because we want to not only reduce the problematic behaviours, but also increase

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,220
appropriate or desirable behaviours.

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,930
She might want him to do his homework when she asks him to, or negotiate a time at which

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,170
he will do his homework; as opposed to swearing and threatening her with a corkscrew.

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,609
She might want him to keep his voice at a suitable volume rather than yelling.

9
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,620
She might want him to find more appropriate ways of expressing his frustration as opposed

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,399
to verbally abusing and physically threatening her.

11
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,010
It’s not all about what she doesn’t want Jamie to do, but redirecting him to things

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,370
that she wants him to do––positive things that she can then praise him for.

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,929
Now, if we were doing behavioural parent training with Jamie and his mum, we would actually

14
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:07,170
get them to begin practicing the new strategies at home when they were both calm.

15
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,320
So, if being asked to do his homework is a regular trigger for Jamie’s behaviour, we

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,890
would have them role play this situation.

17
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,090
We would have mum practice how she is going to manage when Jamie starts to swear and become

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,780
physically aggressive.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,390
We would also have her practice giving Jamie lots of very specific praise when he engages

20
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,090
in the positive behaviors that she’s told him she want to see more of.

21
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,549
Of course, Jamie is also having to do some work too.

22
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,320
He’s having to engage in the behaviours that mum wants to see more of, like doing

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,550
his homework when asked, using a quiet voice and polite words and so on.

24
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,310
On the point of praise —and I do this all the time; I’m as guilty of it as the next

25
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:51,759
parent —we often will make comments like good boy, good girl, nice job, well done,

26
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,130
that sort of thing.

27
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,210
This is generic, very general praise.

28
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,939
When we’re doing a parenting intervention like you would want to do with Jamie and Christine,

29
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,679
the praise needs to be very specific, so that the child knows exactly what it is they have

30
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,640
done that you like so that they can do it again in the future.

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,710
For instance, rather than, “Good boy,” you might say, “Jamie, I really like it

32
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,800
that when I asked you to do your homework, you went and got your school bag straight

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,970
away”.

34
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,920
This praise is really specific.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,800
Jamie knows exactly what it is that he’s done that his mum likes so that he can do

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,450
it again in the future.

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,110
Lastly, Jamie’s mum might remove attention from some of the behaviour that she doesn’t

38
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,680
like and pay more attention to the behaviour that she does like.

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,730
There are other behaviours on the other hand – specifically the physical threats and

40
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,980
aggression – where ignoring is not an appropriate strategy, and mum would need to use more assertive

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,970
management strategies such as Quiet Time and Time Out.

42
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,799
Here is Jamie and his mum after they have participated in the Triple P – positive

43
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:53,720
parenting program.
