00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:14,360
While many older adults experience some physical or mental ill health issues in later life,

1
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,650
there are abundant treatments available that can help maintain high quality of life, even

2
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,619
in the face of such serious illnesses as dementia.

3
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:32,349
However, often older adults are not offered careful assessment to ascertain good diagnoses

4
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,590
of problems they present to health care professionals.

5
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,050
They may not be offered non-pharmacologic interventions, and any physical issues may

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,659
take precedence over psychological concerns, with sometimes unfortunate consequences.

7
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:56,430
We need to be mindful of reducing discrimination and ageism in our approach to older persons

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,230
as health care professionals.

9
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,190
The United Nation’s ‘Principles for Older Persons’ spells out some of the rights and

10
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,250
respect which come with age, and many of these have particular relevance for caring for the

11
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,180
psychological health of our elders.

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,500
These include the right to reside at home as long as possible, to access health care

13
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:28,969
to help them maintain or regain the optimum level of physical, mental, and emotional well-being

14
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:32,659
and to prevent or delay the onset of illness.

15
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:38,380
With respect to nursing home care, older adults have the right to utilize appropriate levels

16
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:46,880
of institutional care that provide protection, rehabilitation, and social and mental stimulation

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,170
in a humane and secure environment, including full respect for their dignity, beliefs, needs,

18
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,729
and privacy and for the right to make decisions about their care and quality of life.

19
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:07,729
Finally, older adults have the right to exercise personal autonomy in health care decision

20
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:15,230
making, including the right to die with dignity by assenting to or rejecting treatment designed

21
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,799
solely to prolong life.

22
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:24,440
In order to make sure that the rights of older adults to have good physical and mental health

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,440
in later life are maintained, we need more people trained specifically to care for this

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,720
segment of the population.

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,780
Unfortunately, the overall geriatric health and mental health workforce will fall far

26
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,909
short of needs in the future, given global demographic shifts.

27
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:50,690
We need more young people to choose this interesting and growing area of specialization, whatever

28
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,980
area of health care they may be interested in.

29
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,550
Older adults are reaching out about how they want to live the last years of their life

30
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:06,780
– in an engaged, meaningful and purposeful way, contributing to their families, communities,

31
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,970
and society more generally.

32
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,170
Particularly as health professionals, we should be open and receptive to hearing the wishes,

33
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,340
and the voices, of older people.
