0
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:12,240
So, while Pavlov was studying the automatic salivating response his dogs had to meat powder,

1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,289
he unexpectedly discovered that his dogs began to salivate to things that they wouldn’t

2
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,189
normally salivate to.

3
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:22,550
For example, Pavlov’s dogs started to salivate to the presence of the research assistant

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,189
who brought the meat powder into the laboratory.

5
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,359
They even started salivating to the sounds of the research assistant’s footsteps as

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,539
the assistant approached the laboratory.

7
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,680
Therefore, Pavlov’s dogs seemed to have anticipated the meat powder, and responded

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,030
to previously neutral stimuli that were associated with the arrival of the meat powder.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,400
Pavlov wanted to know if he could train his dogs to elicit the same salivating response

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,711
to other stimuli that wouldn’t naturally elicit salivating responses from dogs, for

11
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,890
example a clicking metronome.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,890
Pavlov started with an initially neutral stimulus, the clicking metronome.

13
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,799
He then paired the clicking metronome with an unconditioned stimulus that elicited an

14
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,890
automatic unconditioned salivating response, the meat powder.

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,229
Pavlov then repeatedly paired the clicking metronome with the meat powder.

16
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:22,060
Over a short period of time, Pavlov’s dogs demonstrated salivating responses to the presentation

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,359
of the metronome alone, because they had made an association between the metronome and the

18
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,490
meat powder.

19
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,159
This is classical conditioning.

20
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,460
Because Pavlov’s dogs were trained to salivate to the clicking metronome, the metronome becomes

21
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,639
the conditioned stimulus, and the salivating response to the metronome becomes the conditioned

22
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:45,259
response.

23
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:48,389
Dogs don’t naturally salivate to clicking metronomes.

24
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:54,600
So, Pavlov showed us that animal behaviour could be trained or learned using the principles

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,649
of Classical conditioning.

26
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:02,319
The next big question for behaviourists was… is the same true for humans?

27
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,099
In a famous, though ethically dubious experiment, Watson &amp; Rayner in 1920 showed that it was

28
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,970
possible to train a human child to respond with fear and distress.

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,720
Little Albert was a 9-month old infant who was shown a white rat, a rabbit, a monkey

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,830
and various masks.

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,420
Albert displayed no observable fear in response to any of these stimuli.

32
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,610
In other words, these stimuli weren’t unconditioned stimuli that elicited unconditioned responses...

33
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,560
not like Pavlov’s dogs salivating to meat powder.

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,150
Watson and Rayner did find an unconditioned stimulus however - they realised that when

35
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,290
a hammer was banged against a steel gong behind Little Albert’s head, Little Albert would

36
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,030
cry in distress.

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:53,300
In the study, Watson and Rayner first allowed Little Albert to play with a white rat.

38
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,280
Then, Watson and Rayner snuck up behind Little Albert, and struck a steel gong with a hammer

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,030
only seconds after the rat was shown to Little Albert.

40
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,720
After seven pairings of the rat and loud unpleasant sounds from the gong, Little Albert displayed

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,070
a conditioned crying response to the conditioned rat stimulus alone.

42
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,710
Even on the fifth day of the study, Little Albert only had to see the white rat to immediately

43
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:24,960
show fear, distress, and crying regardless of whether or not the gong was hit.

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,960
The white rat had become a conditioned stimulus that elicited the conditioned response of

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,050
fear and distress in Little Albert.

46
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,050
Watson and Rayner also found that Little Albert developed fear towards stimuli or objects

47
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,430
which shared characteristics with the white rat, for example, a rabbit, a dog, and a fur

48
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,430
coat.

49
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,360
This process is now referred to as stimulus generalisation.
