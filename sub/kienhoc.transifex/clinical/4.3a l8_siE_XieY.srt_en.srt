00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,120
Have you ever choked under pressure?

1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,620
A friend of mine, when he had to give the best man speech at a wedding, was so nervous

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,310
that he forgot the name of the groom.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,520
He had a total mind blank.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,390
The guests were so uncomfortable and he was absolutely dying from embarrassment.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,750
He tried to cover it up by having a swig of his drink, but this only made it worse because

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,940
when he did finally come out with a name, he used the bride’s ex-boyfriend’s name

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,940
by accident!

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,240
The guy really did choke under pressure.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,700
This is an example of a psychological consequence of stress.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,610
Psychologically, stress can impair someone’s performance on a task.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,350
This type of performance impairment often occurs as a result of elevated self-consciousness

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,530
that interferes with the individual’s attention on the task.

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,200
Especially when the stakes are high, and it’s really important that you do well on the task.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,860
We sometimes call this type of performance impairment “choking under pressure”.

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,129
Some athletes have a reputation for choking under pressure.

16
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,329
Greg Norman used to choke under pressure playing golf, and Lleyton Hewitt used to choke under

17
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:09,890
pressure a bit in tennis.

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,220
In tennis, you often see players choke under pressure when playing for match point.

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,240
This can be very interesting and exciting to watch as a spectator.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,340
The idea here is that under some circumstances, particularly stressful events, people become

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,920
more aware of what they’re doing, and this elevated level of self-awareness interferes

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,060
with their attention, which makes it harder for them to perform the necessary behaviours.

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,880
Another problem relating to performance impairment is that it’s hard for people to control

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,799
their competing thoughts.

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,060
For example, for a tennis player, during a big match, they might have a lot of competing

26
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,060
thoughts.

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,670
They might be thinking about the different shots they should be playing, how they should

28
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,689
be serving, and what their strategy is.

29
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,650
Then, they might be thinking about winning, and what that will mean.

30
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,619
These thoughts about winning the game are not going to help them to do well in the game.

31
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,409
It’s likely that these competing thoughts are going to undermine their performance.

32
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,810
Now, prolonged unresolved stress can lead to chronic psychological consequences that

33
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,670
we call burnout.

34
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,640
This is often seen in people with jobs that are stressful, and who are not managing or

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,469
coping with the stress.

36
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,029
Stress-related leave is one of the biggest financial burdens on organisations.

37
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:23,549
It results in a lot of lost hours.

38
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:28,540
The negative effects for people who burn out include things like a loss of self-efficacy

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,390
and confidence, which can make it difficult for them to return to the workplace.

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,559
Burnout is a real problem, and basically it’s due to unresolved stress.
