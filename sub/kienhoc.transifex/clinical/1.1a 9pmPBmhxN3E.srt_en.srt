[VANESSA COBHAM] I have a client who is suffering from

1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,920
depression who&#39;s boss told them that

2
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,820
they should just snap out of it. That

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,290
they just needed to think positive

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,389
thoughts and treat themselves to a short

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,430
holiday or a new wardrobe to make them

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,939
feel happier. As outsiders it can be hard

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,980
to comfort those feeling depressed.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,230
We try our best to give them advice on

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,900
how to feel happy again. But if we don&#39;t

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,189
really know what it&#39;s like to experience

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,920
depression, some of our advice might not

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,660
be so helpful.

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,640
It&#39;s difficult for others to understand

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,079
what an individual suffering from

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,149
depression is actually going through.

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,280
Let&#39;s take a look at the type of advice

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,719
people give for dealing with depression.

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,879
What we&#39;re about to see is actually

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,550
pretty representative -- most people coping

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,289
with depression will tell you that they

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,030
have been given at least some of these

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,949
pieces of advice by different people in

23
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,000
their lives.

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,280
[INTERVIEWER] So, if you had a friend who is suffering from depression,

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,320
what advice would you give them?

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,680
[SPEAKER 2] Um, well, I&#39;d say, maybe they should get out of the

27
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,350
house and go see funny movie because that

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,400
always makes me laugh.

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,460
[INTERVIEWER] If a friend who is suffering from depression,

30
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,940
what advice would you give them?

31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,500
Keep drinking.

32
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,780
Um, go shopping.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Oh, I&#39;d just let them know that I was available.

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,360
They could always give me a call.

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,180
I&#39;d probably just say,  Get over it. Like, life&#39;s too short. Move on.

36
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,860
Get some drinks or do something.

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,780
Maybe get a coffee with friends and maybe just

38
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,130
really try to pull themselves out

39
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,480
of the rut that they&#39;re in.

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,600
Well for me I go through periods when I&#39;m exercising a lot and

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,430
periods where I&#39;m exercising less. And I

42
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,259
find that when i&#39;m not getting out and

43
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,329
going for a run or doing some sport I&#39;m

44
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,549
a lot more tired and I start to feel sad.

45
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,800
So I would tell them to try and get out and

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,440
do something energetic.

47
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,539
It&#39;s okay to be struggling with difficulties

48
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,439
from time to time.

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,570
There&#39;s nothing wrong with you if you

50
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,490
struggle with sadness or depression from time to time.
