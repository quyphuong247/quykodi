00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,289
So you’ve just been asked two questions supposedly designed to assess your intelligence.

1
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:14,800
What you should have hopefully noticed is that these questions were biased depending

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,770
on the culture that you grew up in, or where exposed to via tv and other forms of media.

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,990
The first question asked you which of the following animals does not belong.

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,270
The kangaroo?

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,500
Dingo?

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,730
Wombat?

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,779
Or is it the Platypus?

8
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,550
Well the answer is “platypus”.

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,079
It’s the only one there that lays eggs, it’s a monotreme.

10
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
Now this is an easier question if you’ve grown up in Australia learning about these

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,399
animals.

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,370
The Platypus’s unusual characteristics are commonly taught at school.

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,629
Notice how I didn’t make a joke about any of those animals stealing babies?

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,139
Now the second question, which was How many nickels are in a quarter?

15
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:52,420
Well, here’s a quarter.

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,749
That’s 25 cents in currency in the United States of a America.

17
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:57,749
And here’s a nickel.

18
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,320
They’re worth 5 cents in the USA.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,229
So the correct answer is 5.

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,591
If you are someone who is from Australia or another country outside of the USA, question

21
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:11,660
two may have appeared more difficult to answer compared to question one.

22
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,970
We don&#39;t use quarters in Australia.

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,790
So, it’s a monetary system we&#39;re not familiar with.

24
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,930
Unless you grew up in the United States or spent some time there, you wouldn&#39;t necessarily

25
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,860
be familiar with quarters and nickels.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,250
In Canada, they have loonies and toonies.

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,480
Loonie refers to a Canadian one dollar coin and toonie refers to a Canadian two dollar

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
coin.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,060
So we could have made this question easier for Canadians to answer and more difficult

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,250
for everyone else.

31
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,700
How well you do on these questions is largely a function of your culture not your intelligence.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,980
This is why the two questions from the previous activity are biased because they&#39;re not really

33
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,170
assessing intelligence.

34
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,750
They’re assessing your cultural knowledge to a large extent.
