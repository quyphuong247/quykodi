00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,360
So, how have people tried to assess intelligence?

1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,020
What is intelligence actually made up of?

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,179
The first systematic attempt to assess intelligence was in France; when the education board decided

3
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,239
they needed to do something about children who were struggling in school.

4
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,529
A lot of history books portrayed this movement as an attempt by the French education board

5
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,609
to try to help children who were struggling, by giving them extra help so they could keep

6
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,429
up with the rest of the class.

7
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:35,680
However, there&#39;s reasonable evidence suggesting that, actually, what they were trying to do

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,770
was kick the struggling children out of school, so that they didn&#39;t detract from the schooling

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,950
of the other children who were capable of being educated.

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,020
So, intelligence tests didn&#39;t have a particularly positive start.

11
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,680
Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon were two French academics who were interested in measuring

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,960
children’s intelligence.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,530
They wrote test items for children to answer back in the early 1900’s.

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,700
This is known as the Binet-Simon Scale.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,210
Binet and Simon wrote the test items for different age groups, and then standardised the items

16
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,250
across age groups with a sample of children.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,244
So for example, if a set of questions were standardised for seven-year olds, ALL seven

18
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:15,540
year old children aged seven would have been able to answer those questions.

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,180
If another set of questions were standardised for eight year old children, all children

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,369
who were aged eight would have been able to answer those questions.

21
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:28,990
From the test results, the children were then assigned a mental age based on the age-normed

22
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,249
items that they were able to pass.

23
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:35,909
That’s not a number that we call IQ yet, it&#39;s just a number representing the child’s

24
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,270
mental age.

25
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,820
Later on, an American psychologist, Lewis Terman was interested in measuring intelligence.

26
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,079
He saw what Binet and Simon were doing in France with their measure, and decided to

27
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,859
take that measure and adapt it for the American context.

28
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:55,670
Terman translated Binet and Simon’s intelligence measure into English, and re-standardised

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,929
the questions.

30
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:03,069
He introduced the concept of IQ, which was the ratio of a child’s mental age to their

31
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,869
chronological age.

32
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,539
IQ stands for intelligence quotient.

33
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,910
His scale was called the Stanford-Binet Scale, because Terman worked at the Stanford Graduate

34
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,660
School of Education.

35
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,690
For example, if a seven year old child passed all the aged seven normed items, they would

36
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,080
score a mental age of seven.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,851
To work out their IQ according to the Stanford-Binet Scale, we would divide their mental age of

38
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:32,050
seven by their chronological age, which is also seven, and multiply it by 100.

39
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,480
In this example, this seven year old child would score an IQ of 100.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,660
An IQ of 100 means this child is performing at the expected level for their age.

41
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,900
If a seven year old child was able to answer all the 14-year-old age-normed questions,

42
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,280
it would mean that they would have an IQ of 200.

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,320
The problem with the Stanford-Binet Scale is that the age-normed items only really go

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,970
up to 16 years of age, but chronological age keeps rising.

45
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,720
What happens is, if you gave a person with an IQ of 100 this test every year and graphed

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,630
how they scored, the measured mental age would increase in lockstep with their chronological

47
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,250
age and they would have an IQ of 100 at each time we measured it because their mental age

48
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,340
would match their chronological age, so the IQ stays the same.

49
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,400
However, when they hit 16 years of age, the measured IQ would actually start decreasing

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,110
because as their chronological age increases, their measured mental age is at the top of

51
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,820
the scale and so doesn’t keep up with their chronological age any more.

52
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,310
This is purely a function of the maths calculating IQ this way.

53
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,410
It&#39;s not that people become less intelligent in their teenage years, despite what their

54
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,060
parents might say.

55
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,070
It&#39;s just because the scale doesn’t have any items beyond age 16.

56
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,730
This way of calculating IQ fell out of favour over time, because it wasn&#39;t very adaptable

57
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,440
to broader age groups.

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,170
Today when we measure IQ, we&#39;re not talking about the ratio of chronological age to mental

59
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,170
age.

60
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,130
What we do is we compare performance on an IQ test to the standardised data we have about

61
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,370
performance on that test.

62
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,310
If someone scored 115 on an IQ test, that&#39;s one standard deviation above the mean.

63
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,850
IQ scores by definition have a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of 15.

64
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,810
Overtime, because people’s average performance on the test gradually increases, we have to

65
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,870
re-standardise the test so that the average is always back to 100.

66
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,970
This is how we work with IQ tests now.

67
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,790
It&#39;s literally on the basis of the standard normal curve.
