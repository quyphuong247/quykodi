How do we measure how intelligent someone is?

1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,460
How do we measure what someone is able to do now or in the future?

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,970
How do we measure someone’s general cognitive functioning, or measure aspects of their personal

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,390
character?

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,340
Psychological research into intelligence has looked at how we should measure things

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,120
like people’s intelligence in a way that’s reliable and valid.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,980
There are lots of different types of tests that you might be asked to complete throughout

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,680
your life, but we can generally break them down into four categories: aptitude, achievement,

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,720
intelligence, and personality.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,700
Aptitude tests measure what someone might be able to do in the future.

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,540
If you&#39;ve ever applied for a job and have been in a job interview where you&#39;ve had to

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,480
complete tests or answer questions beyond the &quot;Why do you want this job?&quot;

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,570
type of question, it’s likely that you were given an aptitude test to complete.

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,879
For example, as an employer, if the position you&#39;re trying to fill relies on the individual’s

14
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,409
ability to sell products, you might want to recruit people who score high on the measure

15
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,810
of extraversion or something like that.

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,790
A high score on the measure of extraversion suggests that the individual is outgoing,

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,050
which means that they are more likely to engage in conversation with strangers compared to

18
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,690
someone who scores low on extraversion.

19
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,910
As a result, it’s likely that people scoring high on extraversion will be able to do well

20
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,590
in a job in sales.

21
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,810
Achievement tests measure what someone is able to do now.

22
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,590
The quizzes that you&#39;ve been completing in this course are achievement tests.

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,970
They measure your mastery of the content that we&#39;ve covered in the course so far.

24
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,600
Intelligence tests measure an individual’s general cognitive functioning.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,490
For a job that requires the individual to rely on their cognitive ability, you might

26
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,090
use an intelligence test to try and assess their level of cognitive capability.

27
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,170
Personality tests measure the aspects of someone’s personal character.

28
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,220
These tests evaluate the individual’s attributes that are consistent across settings and contexts,

29
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,920
that together, represent their personality.
