0
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,510
Validity assesses the accuracy of the test in measuring what it is meant to measure.

1
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,960
So we should also ask if a test is valid.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,109
If we want to measure the height of this person, maybe we can get out some bathroom scales

3
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,270
and measure her body mass.

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,770
Body mass is correlated with height after all, as taller people tend to weigh more.

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,220
Maybe we can use that to work out her height?

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,520
However, we’re measuring body mass - that’s not actually measuring height, which is what

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,840
we are trying to measure.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,030
So, a more valid measure of height would be a tape measure.

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,800
Now, when we&#39;re talking about things like intelligence, we can’t just go to the hardware

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,250
store and buy a tool for measuring intelligence.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,540
Tests measuring intelligence have to be developed.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,170
We then have to make some estimate of the extent to which these tests are actually measuring

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,570
what we agree is the thing that we&#39;re calling intelligence.

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,971
There are three major types of validity: predictive validity, criterion validity, and construct

15
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:05,030
validity.

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,100
Predictive validity refers to whether or not the scores on the test match with later outcomes.

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,010
For example, when using an intelligence test to predict job performance, what we would

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,320
want to do is measure a person’s intelligence at one point, and then some time later, compare

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,640
their performance in the job to their scores on the intelligence test.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,750
If their intelligence test scores predict their job performance, then we would say that

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,400
it has predictive validity for that purpose.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,100
We could then use the intelligence test when hiring new people for the job to give us some

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,740
idea about who might be the best candidate to hire.

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,439
But then, we see how they perform on the job six months later to see whether or not this

25
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
person’s score from the intelligence test is predictive of their job performance.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,380
This would give us some idea about the validity of using the intelligence test to assess possible

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,229
job performance.

28
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,560
Criterion validity is where we match the scores on the test with some other measure––either

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
a previous measure or a concurrent measure of the same thing.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,110
For example, if we’re interested to see whether or not your grades in this course

31
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,840
are a valid measure of your academic performance, what we could do is compare your grades from

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,790
this course with your grades from high school––because your performance at high school is another

33
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,739
measure of your academic ability.

34
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:22,180
Typically, student’s grades from high school are taken over a number of years, and have

35
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,769
been assessed over a range of topics, so they should be a pretty good stable measure for

36
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,139
academic ability.

37
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:34,419
Now, the final way we can assess validity is through construct validity.

38
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:38,930
Construct validity is the idea, not a test, it&#39;s the idea that when we design a measure

39
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,980
for something, the way we’ve designed the measure follows the underlying theory that

40
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,919
we think represents the concept of what we’re measuring.

41
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,840
For example, if we develop an intelligence test on the basis of six underlying constructs

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,859
that are supported by theory and evidence, we need to assess those six underlying constructs

43
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:58,670
in our test.

44
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,900
If the test we’ve developed for personality is made up of three factors, we need to measure

45
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,189
those three factors.

46
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,409
Construct validity refers to how well a test maps onto the underlying theory with regard

47
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:10,159
to the think we’re measuring.
