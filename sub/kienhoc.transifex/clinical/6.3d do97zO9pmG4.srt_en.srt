00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,940
You might be getting the impression that there&#39;s lots of evidence for a single thing called

1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,980
intelligence, G, because that&#39;s what the Raven’s Progressive Matrices and other tests are designed

2
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,220
to measure.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,510
There is actually a way where we can basically tell whether intelligence is one thing or

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,020
multiple things.

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,690
And it is to do with comparing people’s performance on many different tests of intelligence,

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,570
like Spearman did, using a statistical technique called factor analysis.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,890
This is an advanced statistical technique, so I’m just going to very briefly outline

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,890
the basics.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,570
I will be simplifying things terribly here.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,660
Really, all I would like you to take away from this is the underlying concept of factor

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,820
analysis.

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,500
Not how to do it or how to interpret the results from factor analysis.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,430
Now, imagine that we have a couple of tests, and we measure people&#39;s performance on those

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,790
tests, and we plot them on a graph like this as a correlation.

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,110
We could plot a line there that&#39;s designed to summarize those scores and reduce the error

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,640
as much as possible in summarising those scores.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,119
We can see how much error there is by looking at where the individual responses fall in

18
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,439
relation to that line.

19
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,670
What do you notice as scores get larger?

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,770
What happens to the amount of error as the scores get larger?

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,319
So what I’m asking is how far away are the scores from the line?

22
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,659
Well, the amount of error seems to increase as the scores get higher, the points of data

23
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,679
get further and further away from the line.

24
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:38,039
The scores seem to be clumping more together down here, but they’re spreading more apart

25
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,299
up there.

26
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,729
Therefore, this might suggest that using a single correlation or factor is not the best

27
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,399
way to describe this data.

28
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,439
What factor analysis does is it looks at whether one, two, or even three factors better describe

29
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,439
the data.

30
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,249
It goes up to any number it needs to describe the data.

31
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:02,970
How you know when it&#39;s adequately describing the data is the variation around those factors

32
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,990
is reduced to a statistical minimum.

33
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,170
It&#39;s not eliminated, but there is an optimal number where adding more won&#39;t get rid of

34
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,170
any more error.

35
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,170
In actual fact, it can induce more error.

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,790
So, we can statistically tell what number of factors we need to represent these scores.

37
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,470
The idea is, if we give people a bunch of intelligence tests, do factor analysis on

38
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,209
their performance, we should be able to work out how many factors we need to describe their

39
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,319
performance.

40
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,540
These statistical factors map onto how many factors intelligence has.

41
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,030
If we can use a single line to represent their performance, then there&#39;s a single factor,

42
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,720
and we might call it “G”, for general intelligence.

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,939
If we need seven lines to represent their performance on the tests, then there&#39;s seven

44
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,760
underlying factors to intelligence.

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,590
Using factor analysis, we can work out, statistically, the number of factors we need to describe

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,590
intelligence.

47
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:01,420
In 1938, Thurstone conducted a factor analysis of 56 tests to determine the nature of intelligence.

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,439
So, instead of two-dimensional space, like the example before, imagine 56-dimensional

49
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,510
space and doing a factor analysis on that.

50
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,730
Thurstone found seven factors underlying intelligence from the 56 tests.

51
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:22,319
These factors included: Verbal comprehension, verbal fluency, number, spatial visualisation,

52
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,799
memory, reasoning, and perception speed.

53
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,599
Therefore, the conclusion at that time was that there were seven discrete aspects to

54
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,670
intelligence.

55
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,609
Now, you can imagine people who were sort of already committed to thinking about this

56
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,739
notion of general intelligence, this would be a bit of a worry for them in terms of evidence,

57
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,190
because it&#39;s quite inconsistent with the idea of “G”.

58
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:51,310
In 1966, Horn and Cattell performed factor analysis on Thurstone’s seven factors.

59
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,519
Instead of finding seven factors like Thurstone found, they found two higher order factors

60
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,560
that described performance across those seven factors.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,530
They called those higher order factors are fluid intelligence or Gf, which is performance

62
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,690
on culture-free tasks like Raven&#39;s Progressive Matrices, and crystallized intelligence, or

63
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,579
Gc, which is tasks requiring some sort of prior information––for example, what&#39;s

64
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,780
the capital of France?

65
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:25,020
Horn and Cattell suggested that you need both of those to describe test performance, because

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,090
both of those, although they&#39;re related, are not the same thing.

67
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,030
Here is an example of some of the fluid intelligence items.

68
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,222
These items are a little bit more extensive than just progressive matrices.

69
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:39,860
You certainly have matrices in these items, for example, you have to pick which of these

70
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,670
belongs there.

71
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,480
In case you were playing along at home, the answer is four.

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,450
There are also questions that assess analogies, but these don&#39;t require a lot of comprehension

73
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,890
of cultural concepts.

74
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,681
Here, you&#39;ve got to choose something to complete this sequence.

75
00:04:55,681 --> 00:05:01,060
A square is to a triangle as four vertical lines is to...

76
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,130
I’ll let you think for a second ... The answer is three vertical lines, because of

77
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,490
the number of sides.

78
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,070
A lot of these questions tap into different abilities, but they do it in a way that doesn&#39;t

79
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,720
necessarily rely heavily on cultural knowledge.
