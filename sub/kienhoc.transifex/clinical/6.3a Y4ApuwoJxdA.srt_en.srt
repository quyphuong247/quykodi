00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,920
So, what is intelligence?

1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,840
While psychologists generally agree with what it is they&#39;re measuring when it comes to intelligence,

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,320
like the person’s ability to learn and remember information, to recognise concepts and their

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,089
relations, and to apply the information to their own behaviour in an adaptive way, they

4
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:29,179
disagree quite strongly about the nature of intelligence and how it works.

5
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:35,120
There&#39;s two real camps in this debate: General intelligence, also known as G, and multiple

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,590
intelligences.

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,800
The general or “G” side of the debate is the idea that there&#39;s a thing we call general

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,040
intelligence which underlies all of our abilities.

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,330
For example, if someone is good at maths, they’re probably going to be good at music

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,790
because they&#39;re both driven by the one thing.

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,850
The alternative perspective is the multiple intelligence perspective.

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,829
You may hear people say something like, &quot;Look, I&#39;m not real good at math, but I&#39;ve got really

13
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,350
good emotional intelligence and I can connect with people.&quot;

14
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,159
Gardner thought we had a number of subskills that made up our intelligence.

15
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,030
These were Linguistic skills, musical skills, logical/mathematical skills, spatial skills,

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,170
bodily/kinaesthetic abilities, intra-personal intelligence, and inter-personal intelligence.

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,649
The idea is that these are actually quite independent abilities.

18
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,600
There&#39;s no general intelligence underlying everything.

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,969
You can be good at some of these and not so good at others.

20
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,929
They&#39;re just unrelated abilities.

21
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,990
Gardner was the main proponent of that perspective.

22
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,770
If we take a look at the diagram showing the structure of the WAIS measures, which of those

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,240
two schools of thought do you think the WAIS is coming from?

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,709
Do you think it&#39;s more consistent with general intelligence or multiple intelligences?

25
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,020
It&#39;s kind of tricky.

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,130
There&#39;s lots of things that it measures.

27
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,469
But the way it calculates IQ is that it assumes that IQ is a function of all of those things

28
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,389
in some sort of related fashion.

29
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:08,610
This is an example of a general intelligence model of how we should measure intelligence.
