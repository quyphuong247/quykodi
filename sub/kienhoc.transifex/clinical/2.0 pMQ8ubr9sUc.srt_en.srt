Diagnosing mental illness is very different to diagnosing physical illness.

1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,050
By and large, mental illnesses are still diagnosed through the assessment of signs and symptoms.

2
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,200
With physical illnesses on the other hand - after a presentation of signs and symptoms

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,490
- we can usually confirm a diagnosis with actual physical tests, such as blood tests,

4
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,869
scans, biopsies et cetera.

5
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:34,390
For centuries we have been working on attempting to classify mental illnesses in order to understand

6
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,010
them better and so be able to develop more effective treatments.

7
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,360
It’s been a long and difficult process.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,320
This process has produced two classification systems that are a bit like “bibles” that

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,159
mental health practitioners use to diagnose mental illness.

10
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,950
The first one is called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – and

11
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,200
the most current edition is the DSM-5 – which was published in 2013.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,860
This is the one I am going to be referring to today.

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,330
The second classification system is the International Classification of Diseases or the ICD and

14
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,759
this is widely used in the UK and Europe.

15
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,120
Why am I telling you this?

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,549
Well, so that you understand that the way in which mental illnesses are thought about

17
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,969
– in terms of the category in which they belong and their diagnostic criteria - - may

18
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:26,840
change from one edition to the next – whether we are talking about the DSM or the ICD.

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,399
We are going to be talking about two categories of disorders that often occur comorbidly,

20
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,990
or concurrently – the depressive disorders and the anxiety disorders.

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,500
First we’ll talk about the Depressive disorders.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,999
Incidentally, coming back to what I was talking about before in terms of the changes we can

23
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:49,560
see from one edition of the DSM to another, we’ve begun to understand that bipolar disorders

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,450
represent a bridge between depressive and psychotic disorders, in terms of symptomatology,

25
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,969
family history, and genetics.

26
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:04,060
As a result, in the DSM-5, depressive disorders are no longer grouped with bipolar disorders,

27
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,270
as they were in the past.
