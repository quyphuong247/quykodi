Freud thought that psychological distress was a result of a conflict between these three

1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,150
components of the psyche.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,820
For most of the time, the id, the Ego, and the Superego are able to work things out harmoniously.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,660
BUT sometimes, they become conflicted.

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,620
Imagine your best friend decides to come over and introduce you to their new romantic partner.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,540
Then, suddenly, your id notices that this person is actually really hot.

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,600
Your id goes, &quot;Oh yes, it’s business time&quot; and is planning all these things that would

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,829
be fun to do with your best friend&#39;s romantic partner.

8
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,750
The superego––remembering the sense of right and wrong–– will start to worry

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,550
about breaking the social conventions and rules.

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,960
It realises that there will be negative outcomes if the id goes ahead with its plan.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,100
Then, your poor old ego has to do something to resolve the conflict between the id and

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,230
the superego.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,620
Now, sometimes, the id&#39;s base urges can be satisfied later in a more appropriate setting.

14
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,960
But obviously in this example, it would  be inappropriate to wait until your friend turns

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,160
their back and try to get it on with their partner.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,500
Therefore, some other way of resolving the conflict has to be found.

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,680
According to Freud, what the ego can do is use a range of defence mechanisms to deal

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,570
with the anxiety produced by conflict when you can&#39;t directly give the id what the id

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,060
wants.

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,500
You might be familiar with some of these defense mechanisms: Repression, denial, regression,

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:40,920
reaction-formation, projection, displacement, rationalisation, intellectualisation, identification

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,170
with the aggressor, sublimation.

23
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,920
You may have heard some of these before like repression, or denial—both of those involve

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,250
a failure to acknowledge the distressing experiences.

25
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,050
You’ve got things like projection––this is where you project your desires onto other

26
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,190
people as a way of dealing with your own desires.

27
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,130
For example, you might start thinking, &quot;Well, my friend&#39;s romantic partner secretly thinks

28
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,140
I&#39;m hot.

29
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,910
That’s inappropriate, because they’re crossing all the social rules and boundaries.

30
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,319
I don&#39;t like them.

31
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,329
They shouldn&#39;t be doing that.&quot;
