00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,670
The first question is whether or not a test is standardised.

1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,250
What we&#39;re really asking here is: do we know what the average level of performance is?

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,950
Do we know what the mean score is?

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,800
Do we know something about how much scores vary around that mean?

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,560
To find this out, we have to give the test to a large number of people.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,320
Look at their scores on the test and work out what their average score is, and how much

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,080
variation there is around that average.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,770
In doing this, it&#39;s important to keep in mind what those people are like.

8
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,010
For example, if I&#39;m interested in developing an intelligence test for university students,

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,650
I would standardise the test on a large sample of university students.

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,060
If I wanted to develop a test for university students, imagine that instead of standardising

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,280
the test on university students, I went to all the primary or elementary schools here

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,600
in Brisbane instead for some reason.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,610
And I gave the school children the test to work out the average level of performance

14
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,980
and how much variation there is around the mean on this test.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,329
Clearly, this would not give me useful information about what the average performance on the

16
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,950
test would likely be for when I use it with university students.

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,990
The population that you standardise the test on has to be relevant for the people who you’ll

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,340
be testing.

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,040
This was a problem early on for a lot of tests.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,690
It&#39;s certainly the case now that many tests are still standardised on limited sets of

21
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,690
the population.

22
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,580
Often, the easiest groups of people you can get are university students or people in the

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,500
general community in Western cultures.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,040
These are often the populations that different tests are standardised on.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,090
This can make it tricky to compare how someone performs on a test from one culture with how

26
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,119
someone performs on the same test but in another culture.

27
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,770
We’ll come back to this issue later, but it’s a difficult problem, and the answer

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,710
is somewhat complicated.

29
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,939
So as you’ve probably guessed, the reason why we care about standardisation is because

30
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,770
it tells us how well somebody has performed.

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,650
If I said I have an IQ of 115, would you say that that&#39;s high or low?

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,700
In order to know whether an IQ of 115 is high or not, we need to know what the average,

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,430
or more accurately, the mean IQ score is on this test.

34
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,680
It would also be good to know how spread out people are above and below this mean, this

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,220
is the variance in scores, and we measure this using the standard deviation.

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,359
Essentially, we want to know what the distribution looks like, what properties it has.

37
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:37,319
When we standardise our test, we have this information.

38
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,810
Let&#39;s talk through an example.

39
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,389
Let&#39;s talk about height.

40
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:45,580
Now, If you measure enough people on any attribute, on things like height, and you plot their

41
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,349
scores on a graph like this…

42
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:53,739
We&#39;ve got the number of people on the Y axis, and heights on the X axis, what we end up

43
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,640
with is something that looks like a normal distribution.

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,029
A normal distribution has certain characteristics that we can use to estimate properties of

45
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:02,749
the distribution.
