00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,270
Imagine what life would have been like for those living with a psychotic mental illness

1
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,830
a hundred years ago.

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,710
They were stigmatised and discriminated against by society.

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,590
With minimal scientific knowledge about psychosis, people experiencing any symptoms would have

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,060
been classified as “insane” or “feeble-minded”.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,360
Today, when it comes to mental illness, the two most commonly used diagnostic systems

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,910
are the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the DSM, and the International

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,750
Classification of Diseases or the ICD.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,000
Let’s take a look at the diagnostic criteria for Schizophrenia in the current DSM – the

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,480
DSM-5.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,700
As a diagnosis, Schizophrenia lives within a category of the DSM-5 called Schizophrenia

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,190
Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,260
For each specific mental illness, the DSM lists the criteria an individual must meet

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,579
in order to be diagnosed with that illness.

14
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,140
We are just going to cover the first criterion set – criterion A – those relating to

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,181
the symptoms of the illness.

16
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:14,869
Just to give you a sense of the diagnosis as a whole, the other criterion sets for schizophrenia

17
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:20,649
relate to degree of dysfunction, duration, and exclusion of other possible causes of

18
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:26,060
the presentation (such as substance use or other mental illnesses).

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,719
In order to meet the criteria for this diagnosis, the symptoms must have been present for a

20
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,369
six-month period or longer, with at least one month of active symptoms.

21
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:39,530
The five main symptoms are:

22
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:46,249
Delusions, Hallucinations, Disorganised speech, Grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour

23
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:47,909
and Negative symptoms.

24
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,299
It isn’t necessary for an individual to demonstrate ALL these symptoms.

25
00:01:53,299 --> 00:02:00,299
To be diagnosed with Schizophrenia, a person needs to show two or more symptoms.

26
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,179
The symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are typically thought of––and

27
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:09,380
referred to––as positive symptoms or negative symptoms.

28
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,480
In this context, the word positive refers to the fact that the behaviours or experiences

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,000
that make up these symptoms are happening too much.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,690
Negative symptoms, on the other hand, are behaviours that are essentially in deficit;

31
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,200
behaviours that are not occurring as often as we would like.

32
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,340
We’re going to look at each of the symptoms in turn.
