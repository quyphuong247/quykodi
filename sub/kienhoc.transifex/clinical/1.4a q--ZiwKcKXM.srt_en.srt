00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,500
How do we know which therapies actually work?

1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,290
Well, very specific guidelines have been put forward - for instance, by the American Psychological

2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,680
Association.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,790
According to these guidelines, in order for an intervention to be evidence-based, there

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,340
need to have been at least two independent randomised controlled trials––otherwise

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,119
known as RCTs, that indicate that the intervention is useful in treating a particular presenting

6
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,119
problem.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,530
It’s important to have at least two independent randomised controlled trials.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,500
Let’s say I write a treatment program for treating anxiety disorders in children, which

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,110
is one of my areas of interest and expertise.

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,870
Then I publish five papers on five different RCTs that I’ve done with my intervention.

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,900
Potentially, I have a vested interest in trying to show that my intervention works.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,380
This is why having two separate independent RCTs is so important.

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,850
You need to have at least two independent RCTs that have been conducted by different

14
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,800
groups of researchers, and have not all come out of the same research group that potentially

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,460
has a vested interest in a particular intervention.

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,740
So that’s the first criterion.

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,010
The second criterion is that the active treatment that you’re evaluating has to be better

18
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,220
than either a placebo condition, or an alternative active treatment.

19
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,300
For those who might not be familiar with what a placebo is, the easiest way to think about

20
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,280
it is in terms of pharmaceutical trials.

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,660
Let’s pretend we’re trialing a new antidepressant medication.

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,740
We’re hoping that this new antidepressant medication will have the effect of improving

23
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,909
people’s mood.

24
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,370
But we also have a placebo condition in which participants receive a tablet with no active

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,710
ingredients – often referred to as a sugar pill.

26
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,509
People in a pharmaceutical trial don’t know which condition they have been assigned to

27
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,790
– the active medication condition or the placebo condition.

28
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,441
They have been randomly assigned to one of the two conditions – hence the term Randomised

29
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:05,950
Controlled Trial.

30
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,369
For us to be able to say that an intervention is evidence based, the active intervention

31
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,890
we’re evaluating has to perform better than the placebo and/or the alternative treatment

32
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,600
that we’re comparing it against.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,569
The final criterion is that the RCT must be competently carried out.
