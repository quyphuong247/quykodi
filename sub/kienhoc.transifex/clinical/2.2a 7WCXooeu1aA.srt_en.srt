How common are the Depressive Disorders?

1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,679
Australian and US data indicate that the 12-month prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder in

2
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,529
adults is between 6 and 7 percent.

3
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:21,749
But, if you look at different age groups, youâ€™ll see that the prevalence in 18 to

4
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:27,419
29 year olds is about 3 times the prevalence in people aged 60 or older.

5
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:32,560
Females are more likely to develop major depressive disorder than males, with a prevalence difference

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,020
in the order of 1.5 to 3 times, depending on the study.

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,010
The 12-month prevalence rate for Persistent depressive disorder is 0.5% (Blanco et al.,

8
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,010
2010).

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,500
Interestingly, many adults with depressive disorders will say that their depression first

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,650
began in adolescence or early adulthood.

11
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,280
This seems to be particularly true for Persistent Depressive Disorder (Mondimore et al., 2006).

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,470
By the way, it&#39;s possible to meet criteria for each of these disorders simultaneously.

13
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,239
This is referred to as double depression.

14
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,829
If you have both disorders at once, not surprisingly, your level of impairment is higher and your

15
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,029
prognosis is worse than if you had only one of the two disorders.
