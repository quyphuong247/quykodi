If your knowledge of psychological therapy only came from TV or movies, you may think

1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,320
clinical psychologists sit in an armchair, while their patients make themselves comfortable

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,580
on a couch sharing the trauma of their childhood.

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,720
This is a very stereotypical picture of Freudian style psychodynamic therapy.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,580
But in fact, there are many different schools or models of psychological therapy.

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,980
However, biological, psychodynamic, behavioural, and cognitive behavioural are arguably the

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,500
four foundational models of therapy.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,400
On its own, the Biological model is somewhat simplistic, suggesting that emotional distress

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,310
is caused by biological or genetic determinants – for instance a deficit in a particular

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,530
neurotransmitter such as serotonin or dopamine.

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,559
Biological and genetic influences are certainly important in understanding mental health – and

11
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,589
this is particularly true for some mental illnesses.

12
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:04,650
Typically, clinicians take what is referred to as a ‘biopsychosocial’ approach to

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,210
understanding mental illness – looking not only at biological factors, but also psychological

14
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,180
and social factors.

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,920
Psychodynamic Therapy has been so incredibly important historically.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,399
Sigmund Freud, who is widely regarded as the founder of clinical psychology even though

17
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:27,020
he was originally a neurologist, founded Psychodynamic Therapy.

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,710
Many of his ideas – for example, his thoughts about the importance of the feelings a client

19
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,740
has towards their therapist and vice versa – have really stood the test of time and

20
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,929
remain core constructs that most mental health clinicians keep in mind when thinking about

21
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,859
clients and their presentations.

22
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:49,140
Behavioural Therapy, as its name suggests is very focused on what people do, or how

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,499
they behave.

24
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:54,289
Central to Behavioural therapy are the two different types of conditioning: classical

25
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,960
conditioning and operant conditioning.

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,969
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT, builds on Behavioural Therapy with its emphasis on

27
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,789
the role of cognitions or thoughts and their importance in determining the way we feel

28
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:10,369
and the way we behave.

29
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,950
Behavioural therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy are arguably the two therapies with

30
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,700
the strongest evidence bases.
