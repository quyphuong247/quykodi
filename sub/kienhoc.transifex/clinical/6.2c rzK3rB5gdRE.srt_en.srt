0
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,140
So how did you go on those questions?

1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,290
We asked you what is the capital of France?

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,270
How are goldfish and canaries similar to each other?

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,270
And:

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,480
Why are we tried by a jury of our peers?

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,039
These are all representative of items on some contemporary tests of intelligence, like the

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,839
digit span task we talked about before.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,439
So, what&#39;s the capital of France?

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,560
Well, it’s Paris.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,240
The problem with this question is that, this would not be a difficult question for those

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,510
who have learned about Western geography.

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,670
However, for those who are unfamiliar with Western geography, they might not know the

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,829
answer.

13
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:46,579
Does that make them less intelligent?

14
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,579
NO.

15
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,449
It&#39;s a function of the culture people are schooled in that they can answer questions

16
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,460
like: “What&#39;s the capital of France?”

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,100
What about the next question: “How are goldfish and canaries similar to each other?”

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,390
Some of my students scratch their heads when I ask them this.

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,090
They might say, “well they can both fly”... hmmm, that’s not quite right.

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,590
Or they might say they are both gold.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,160
Also not quite right.

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,930
The answer is that they’re both commonly kept as pets... in some cultures.

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,760
However, lots of cultures don&#39;t keep canaries and goldfish as pets.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,640
What people consider to be pets is a function of the culture they live in.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,910
Again, this is another question that would be difficult to answer for those from a different

26
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,970
cultural background to the background that the test questions are based on.

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,110
What about the last question: “Why are we tried by a jury of our peers?”

28
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,360
The answer to that is something like, well a jury represents community standards and

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,950
they bring these into the administration of justice.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,970
Or because that’s how we guarantee a fair trial and avoid the Crown or State persecuting

31
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,970
people.

32
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,460
But, what if you live in a country that doesn’t have juries?

33
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,060
It’s probably easier to list the countries that actually do have juries, because there

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,330
aren’t that many.

35
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,380
Australia, England, America, Canada.

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,560
There have been limited trials of mixed juries in Japan and South Korea.

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,030
A lot of other countries don&#39;t have juries.

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,420
This would be a really hard question to answer for those who come from cultures that don’t

39
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,769
have juries.

40
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:22,740
This is a hard enough question to answer even for those who come from a culture where they

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,409
have juries for whatever reason.

42
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,670
If you don&#39;t have trial by jury in your country, this is kind of a nonsensical question.

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,989
The problem here is that these questions are reasonably representative of the questions

44
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,680
from many contemporary intelligence tests.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,420
The problem with these sort of questions is that they really do assume a lot of background

46
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,829
information to be able to know what the answer is.
