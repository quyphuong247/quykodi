So far, we have covered the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,180
Now we have come to the last of the five symptom sets – the negative symptoms.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,940
Remember, these symptoms reflect normal behaviours that are actually in deficit.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,280
It’s the fact that these behaviours are not occurring enough that’s the problem,

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,440
rather than the behaviours occurring too much.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,740
Unlike the positive symptoms, negative symptoms are seen across a whole range of different

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,370
mental illnesses.

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,980
Some of the key domains or areas––in which people with schizophrenia might demonstrate

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,920
negative symptoms––include the expression of affect or emotion, speech, and motivation.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,980
Let’s talk about affect first.

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,450
There are a number of ways in which a person’s affect, or expression of emotion, may be disturbed.

11
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,090
One of the most common is what’s referred to as ‘flat affect’, where the expression

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,250
of emotion through tone of voice and facial expression is significantly reduced.

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:09,560
Alogia is also known as poverty of speech, and involves a lack of spontaneous speech,

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,619
which reflects impoverished thought processes.

15
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,619
Avolition is a negative symptom that you actually see across a number of different disorders.

16
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,860
Depression springs to mind straightaway because what we’re talking about here is a lack

17
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,479
of motivation and along with that, often social withdrawal from a person’s family, from

18
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,130
their friends, and so on.

19
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,880
Another common negative symptom involves lack of self-care around personal hygiene.
