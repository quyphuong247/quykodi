00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,260
If you have completed any intelligence measures, it’s likely that you have completed one

1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,180
of the Wechsler intelligence scales developed by an American psychologist David Wechsler.

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,080
The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, also known as WAIS, is an intelligence test for

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
adults.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,939
It was first developed back in 1955.

5
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:27,990
Since then, a few different versions of the test have been developed.

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,150
We are now up to the WAIS–IV (FOUR).

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,660
Now, because of the issues with age, separate versions of the test have been developed for

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,660
children.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,320
The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, or WISC, is used for young children and the

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,490
Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, or WPPSI, is used for pre-school aged children.

11
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,410
Different questions are used for different age groups and the different tests are standardised

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,080
on the appropriate age groups.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,930
People’s performance on the test is then compared to the standardised information.

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,540
Now, when people complete the WAIS, they receive a score that represents their overall, or

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:13,220
fullscale IQ, which is broken down into two components verbal IQ, performance IQ.

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,990
Each of these has two secondary indices.

17
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,979
For verbal IQ they are verbal comprehension, working memory, for performance IQ they are

18
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,380
perceptual organization, and processing speed.

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,620
These additional performance indicators provide people with fairly detailed information about

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,170
their performance across a number of different domains from the test.

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,310
These tests are typically administered by trained test administrators.

22
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,280
Typically these tests assess things like digit span, or the ability to keep a series of numbers

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,050
in working memory, which is a component of verbal IQ.

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,510
So I might ask you to to repeat the following numbers back out aloud once I’ve finished

25
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,659
saying them.

26
00:01:53,659 --> 00:02:01,570
7, 4, 9, 2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 8.

27
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:08,729
So how did you go with that task?

28
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,489
What you will notice, unlike the questions I asked you about Australian animals or American

29
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,890
currency, this task doesn’t rely on much culture-based knowledge.

30
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,700
Let’s try a few more questions in an activity.
