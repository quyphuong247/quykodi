00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,820
The symptom set of delusions is considered to be a positive symptom.

1
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,389
Delusions are related to thought.

2
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,960
However, they’re specifically related to the content of thought.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,270
Thought can be broken down into content and form.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,390
Imagine that as you are listening to me, you are also thinking to yourself, “I need to

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,570
go out to the supermarket and get something for dinner tonight.

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,680
I want something easy.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,070
I might buy some noodles”.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,870
If we drew you as a cartoon character, and wrote your thoughts into a thought bubble

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,680
over your head, these words would reflect the content of your thought.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,570
Now, delusions involve people having a false belief, so the content of their thought is

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,980
inaccurate or false.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,470
Their false thoughts are not explained by their religious, or cultural beliefs.

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,640
In other words, we can’t say...

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,059
“Well, this person holds that belief because they come from this particular religious or

15
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:02,790
cultural group and most people within that group also hold this belief.”

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,130
Importantly, with regard to delusions, we are referring to the false beliefs that a

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,159
person holds despite all evidence to the contrary.

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,500
It’s absolutely pointless to try and persuade someone with a delusion that they are incorrect.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,740
There are several different types of delusions.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,939
Two examples are delusions of persecution, and delusions of grandeur.

21
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,400
Delusions of persecution have a paranoid flavour to them, with a theme of others being out

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,670
to get you.

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,350
To give you a sense of what I mean, people experiencing delusions of persecution will

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,200
tell others that somebody is watching them.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,470
They may think that, while they were sleeping, somebody inserted a microchip into their brain

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,200
to monitor their thoughts, or that they are being followed wherever they go.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,290
Now, I work here in Australia.

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,329
Our equivalent of the US Central Intelligence Agency or CIA is the Australian Security Intelligence

29
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,430
Organisation, or ASIO for short.

30
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,120
Despite 20 years of working with people suffering from different types of mental illnesses,

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,030
I have yet to meet somebody experiencing a delusion of persecution who tells me they

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,869
think ASIO is out to get them.

33
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,319
It’s always the CIA...

34
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,779
“The CIA is out to get me.”

35
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,709
Sometimes the FBI, but never ASIO.

36
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,799
Perhaps ASIO isn’t very well known, or perhaps it’s just seen as a fairly nonthreatening

37
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:22,799
organisation.

38
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,020
I’m not sure, but you just don’t see it getting a mention in people’s delusions

39
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,319
of persecution.

40
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,459
What about delusions of grandeur?

41
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:37,180
This is where someone believes that they possess qualities or attributes that make them superior

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:44,620
to other people – for instance, money, fame, talent, intelligence or perhaps a special relationship

43
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,280
with someone in a position of power.

44
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,040
Somebody who is experiencing a delusion of grandeur may think they’re really famous

45
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:55,949
or that they’ve achieved something really phenomenal – for instance, finding a cure

46
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,969
for cancer.

47
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,790
To give you another example, I would be experiencing a delusion of grandeur if I thought that I

48
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,359
was Taylor Swift’s best friend.

49
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:10,379
That would be a delusion of grandeur because in our society, Taylor Swift is a celebrity,

50
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,849
and for me to be her best friend would mean that, by association, I would also be an important

51
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,200
person.

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,019
The first person I met who was experiencing a delusion of grandeur believed he was Jesus

53
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,370
Christ, and he wouldn&#39;t talk to me unless I called him by his preferred name, which

54
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,099
was Mr. Christ.

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,960
As long as I called him that, he was happy to talk to me.

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,819
Just to highlight my earlier point... you don’t argue with people about their delusions.

57
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,830
It is an absolutely pointless and antagonistic thing to do.

58
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,089
You just roll with it, which in that case, meant calling the gentleman Mr Christ and

59
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:47,939
trying to build a relationship with him.
