What creates stress in your life?

1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,430
Research has narrowed the number of different ways that things might cause stress for us.

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:19,460
There are four ways, these are frustration, conflict, change, and pressure.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,699
Do any of these sound related to the things that are causing your stress?

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,900
We will talk about each of these four stressors.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,160
Frustration refers to the idea about you having some sort of goal and your pursuit to that

6
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:38,050
goal is disturbed or interrupted, so you can’t achieve the goal that you set out to achieve.

7
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,520
Now, we can actually experience frustration through two slightly different ways.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,510
One is a loss, when you’re deprived of something you’re used to having as a part of your

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,170
everyday life.

10
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,890
These are photos from the 2011 floods in Brisbane.

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,570
A lot of what would have made the flood stressful for people is the loss of all the personal

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,050
belongings that they’re used to having.

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,720
These personal belongings were part of their day-to-day lives.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,680
Failure is slightly different.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,400
It’s when you set out to achieve a goal but you don’t make it.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,500
Virtually everybody will experience failure at some point.

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,650
Most people have goals, and occasionally we fail to achieve them and experience stress

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,490
as a result.

19
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,880
Some people will set unrealistic goals and so become perpetually stressed by not achieving

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,719
those goals.
