00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,540
Now I want to return to an idea that I mentioned earlier – the interaction between genes

1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,200
and the environment in the development of schizophrenia.

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,910
Probably the best, most useful, and accurate way of thinking about how and why schizophrenia

3
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,920
develops is through the lens of what is referred to as a diathesis stress model.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,189
A diathesis stress model proposes that, with schizophrenia, there is an underlying vulnerability

5
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,160
that is most likely related to a genetic predisposition.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,280
However, this vulnerability may only convert into an illness in the context of environmental

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,920
stressors.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,260
This is a diagrammatic representation of the model.

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,739
Hypothesised diatheses for Schizophrenia include genetic factors, physical trauma prenatally

10
00:00:53,739 --> 00:01:00,229
or during birth, structural abnormalities of the brain, and abnormalities in the neurotransmitter

11
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:01,519
systems.

12
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,030
Some of the possible environmental stressors include chronic psychological and social stressors.

13
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,790
For example, those associated with poverty.

14
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,810
Other stressors include, living in a family environment with a high level of negative

15
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,090
expressed emotion, and drug use.

16
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,479
The association between Schizophrenia and drug use is worth emphasising, as there has

17
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,640
been increasing research linking drug use––especially marijuana ––with the development of psychotic

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,670
symptoms in people who have an underlying vulnerability.
