Before we move on from Panic Disorder, I want to use it as an example to talk in a bit more

1
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,910
depth about comorbidity.

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,570
Now, comorbidity is simply where a person meets criteria simultaneously for more than

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,230
one diagnosis.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,460
For example, your primary or most impairing diagnosis might be panic disorder, but you

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,660
might also meet criteria for major depressive disorder and a substance use disorder.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,510
Comorbidity does not just apply to Panic disorder, or even just to the anxiety disorders.

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,390
We see the possibility of comorbidity with any mental illness.

8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,950
Taking Panic Disorder as our example though – the kinds of presentations that are most

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:52,120
commonly comorbid with this particular diagnosis are: depressive disorders, other anxiety disorders

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,719
and substance use disorders.

11
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,780
Depending on the study you look at, somewhere between 10 and 65% of people with a primary

12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,309
diagnosis of Panic disorder will also meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.

13
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,680
Interestingly, in most of these cases, the major depressive disorder develops either

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,229
around the same time or subsequent to the panic disorder.

15
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,310
Let’s think about the co-occurrence of panic disorder and substance use problems for a

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,310
moment.

17
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,050
Why would people with panic disorder, or any number of anxiety disorders for that matter,

18
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,280
be using more illicit drugs and alcohol compared to the general population?

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,270
One of the reasons is that people are essentially using substances to self-medicate, or to try

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,259
and reduce the distress and interference caused by their anxiety symptoms.

21
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:47,200
This use of substances – both legal and illegal – to deal with anxiety is a very

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,860
common phenomenon in western nations.

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,810
We even have an expression – Dutch Courage - where we are referring to the courage, gained

24
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,880
through intoxication with alcohol, to face feared situations.
