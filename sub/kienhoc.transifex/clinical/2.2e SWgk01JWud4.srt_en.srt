00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,590
Antidepressant medication is very commonly used in the management of depression.

1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,450
The most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants is the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

2
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,340
or SSRIs.

3
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,650
Another biological treatment for depressive disorders that tends to be used as a last

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,010
resort, for treatment-resistant depression, is Electroconvulsive therapy or ECT.

5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,610
In terms of psychological interventions, cognitive behavioural therapy or CBT has the strongest

6
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,070
evidence base, with Interpersonal therapy or IPT also showing good outcomes.

7
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:46,109
Two of the key strategies within CBT for the treatment of depression are behavioural activation

8
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,840
and cognitive restructuring.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,359
Behavioural activation, also known as Pleasant Events Scheduling, targets the depressive

10
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,370
symptom of loss of pleasure or interest in previously enjoyed activities.

11
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,499
With this strategy, we work with our client to figure out what activities they used to

12
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,769
enjoy before they became depressed.

13
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,340
Then, we essentially set homework tasks in which the client has to engage in activities

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,830
they previously enjoyed.

15
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,350
Because exercise has been associated with an improvement in mood in some people suffering

16
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,360
from depression, some form of exercise will often be included in behavioural activation

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,410
homework.

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,530
The rationale for behavioural activation is that, with some time, the client will begin

19
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,290
to experience positive reinforcement for engaging in these activities, which will lead to an

20
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,990
improvement in their mood.

21
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,560
So, if a person who, before becoming depressed, enjoyed playing touch football and gaming,

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,990
behavioural activation would involve us setting these kinds of activities as homework tasks

23
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,830
to be undertaken in between therapy sessions.

24
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,460
The second strategy of cognitive restructuring involves working with a client to help them

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,780
identify or catch the thoughts that are contributing to their feelings of sadness and hopelessness;

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,549
and evaluating the evidence for and against the likelihood of these thoughts being accurate.
