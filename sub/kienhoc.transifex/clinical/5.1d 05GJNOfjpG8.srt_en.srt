In later life, which would be more important to you – physical health or mental health?

1
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,440
Unfortunately, in many situations there is a great focus on the physical health of an

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,710
older person and a neglect of the mental or emotional health.

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,670
For example, if an older person falls down a set of stairs and suffers a hip fracture,

4
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,450
most of everyone’s attention will be on the physical consequences of that – including

5
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,410
the older person’s attention!

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,640
But later, if that person feels sad about their now restricted mobility, or their long

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,690
road to rehabilitation, much less attention will be paid to that.

8
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,860
And if the person hit their head, and now is experiencing memory loss, that also may

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,079
not be adequately followed up.

10
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,110
The World Health Organisation’s definition of health states that health goes beyond physical

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,689
health to encompass “a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being, and

12
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:16,369
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (WHO, 1948).

13
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:22,999
This holistic principle of care underlies the best practice care principles of those

14
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,810
who care for older, or geriatric patients.

15
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,770
Some examples of later life health care professionals include geriatricians –physicians who specialize

16
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,549
in later life medical care– and geriatric psychologists, or geropsychologists, like

17
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:41,049
myself.
