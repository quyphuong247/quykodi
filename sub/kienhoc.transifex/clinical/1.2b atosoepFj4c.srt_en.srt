Behaviourism as a movement began in Psychology in 1913 when John Watson published the classic

1
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,360
article, ‘Psychology as the behaviorist views it’.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,930
According to Watson, all aspects of human psychology could be explained by the process

3
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,720
of Classical conditioning.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,160
In other words, everything from speech to emotional responses was simply a pattern of

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,820
stimulus and response.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,550
In his experiments with dogs, Ivan Pavlov showed that classical conditioning applied

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,800
to animals.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,100
To begin with, Pavlov presented a dog with meat powder.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,110
In response to the meat powder, the dog would salivate.

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,960
So the meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus or trigger, and the salivation is the unconditioned

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,059
response.

12
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,010
The salivating responses Pavlov’s dogs had to the meat stimulus are referred to as unconditioned,

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,519
because dogs don’t have to be trained or taught to salivate when they’re presented

14
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:58,729
with the meat powder.

15
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:02,020
This association exists automatically.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:08,090
Then unexpectedly, Pavlov observed that his dogs began to salivate not only to the meat

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,619
powder itself, but to stimuli that wouldn’t naturally elicit salivation but were associated

18
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:14,540
with the meat powder.
