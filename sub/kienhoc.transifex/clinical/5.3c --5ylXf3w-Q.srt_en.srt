00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,039
We don&#39;t have a cure to stop the disease process in dementia.

1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,160
Cells in the brain die as a result of dementia, and we have no current way to halt this,

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,440
even though we&#39;ve been studying Alzheimer’s disease for over a hundred years.

3
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,060
People with dementia don&#39;t usually die directly of the disease.

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:33,620
They die of other related diseases like stroke or pneumonia, usually between 8 and 10 years

5
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,250
after diagnosis.

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,010
Whilst we don’t have a cure, there are many psychosocial interventions for people with

7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,090
dementia and their families, which can make their quality of life much better, right now.

8
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,649
These interventions include various activity-based therapies to keep people with dementia stimulated,

9
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,690
as well as supportive therapies to help those with dementia with symptoms of depression

10
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,229
or anxiety.

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:07,780
Environmental approaches help to make living spaces easy to navigate and homelike – this

12
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,710
is particularly important in nursing homes.

13
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,640
It is important that people in nursing homes are given meaningful activities, as this greatly

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,600
increases health and quality of life.

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,570
It is very important to know that quality of life for people with dementia, even at

16
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:34,070
the very late stages, can be very, very good, but they absolutely need certain things.

17
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:40,450
They need to be in an environment where they&#39;re supported, cared for by people who understand

18
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,450
dementia.

19
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,370
They do better under the care of an interdisciplinary team.

20
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,420
A team of people that know about geriatrics, and friends and family willing to give the

21
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,210
person with dementia patience and respect and love.

22
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,030
Then, they can have quality of life.

23
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,820
The most prominent current model of dementia care is Kitwood’s person centred care model.

24
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,170
At its core it involves having the focus of care on the person, not fulfilling tasks or

25
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,260
just attending to the person’s physical health needs.

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,550
Person centred care includes every sort of interaction with the person with dementia

27
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:27,249
– from how meals are served to how both professional and family carers interact with

28
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,360
the person with dementia.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,389
It is beyond a specific intervention, and importantly includes how medical or health

30
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,129
related care is given.

31
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,019
For example, say that the person with dementia needs to have a bandage changed.

32
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:49,379
In a person-centred approach, the person with dementia is spoken to warmly and reassured,

33
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,780
and what will happen is explained in simple terms.

34
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,739
If the person with dementia is agitated at that moment in time, the care activity is

35
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,959
postponed until they are calmer.

36
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,859
In a task oriented approach, often persons with dementia are ignored while the activity

37
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:13,779
takes place, and the activity is carried out irrespective of how the person is feeling

38
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,799
at that moment.

39
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,219
Although this sounds simple, it is a difficult approach to take in facilities where staff

40
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:26,760
have not been trained in such approaches, or if staff feel overwhelmed with the duties

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,010
expected of them.

42
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,730
In person centred care the person is treated with respect and treated like an individual.

43
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,719
They are given opportunities to have a place of their own, meaningful activities, and made

44
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,269
to feel that they matter.

45
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:50,560
Continuity with their past, present and future goals, likes and dislikes, and so forth, are

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,249
maintained.

47
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:56,900
The person with dementia is helped to feel safe in their environment, yet still afforded

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,959
the chance to engage in novel and stimulating activities.

49
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,590
Their voice is heard.

50
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:12,069
Unfortunately, person centred care remains more the exception than the norm.

51
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,370
Caregivers of persons with dementia are vulnerable to both physical and mental health issues

52
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,669
as a result of caring for a person with dementia.

53
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:28,390
Caregiving is an overwhelmingly female occupation, and overall the largest proportion of caregivers

54
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:35,530
of persons with dementia are spouses who themselves are often of advanced age.

55
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:42,140
In caregivers of persons with dementia compared to other caregivers, levels of psychological

56
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:49,760
distress and stress are significantly higher, and subjective well-being and physical health

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,320
significantly lower.

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,710
Importantly, some studies have shown that by improving the wellbeing of our caregivers

59
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:05,150
who care for older persons with or without a diagnosis of dementia, we can actually delay

60
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,190
when older patients need to be placed in nursing homes.

61
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,480
Make sense?

62
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,340
Take care of the caregivers and both the patient and the caregiver do better.

63
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,290
Some studies showed an average time delay of 1.5 years before nursing home placements

64
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,780
for the care recipient, compared to placement for care recipients whose caregiver received

65
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,100
no such intervention.
