If we think about the aetiology of depressive disorders from a cognitive behavioral perspective,

1
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,840
the behavioral component suggests that depression is maintained by the lack of positive reinforcement

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,869
that results from a person’s failure to engage in previously enjoyed activities.

3
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,769
This in turn feeds into a sense of learned helplessness; a sense of utter powerlessness

4
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,480
in relation to the external environment.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,300
Learned helplessness might be expressed in thoughts such as, “There is nothing I can

6
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,730
do to make myself feel better.

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,700
I may as well just stop trying”.

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,070
From the cognitive perspective, depression is very much about negative thoughts relating

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,910
to the self, the world and the future.

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,280
People who are clinically depressed often, unsurprisingly, demonstrate what is referred

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,050
to as a pessimistic explanatory style, where bad things are attributed to internal, stable

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:06,330
and global factors; while positive things are attributed to external, random factors.

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,260
For example, if I am clinically depressed and I happen to do very well on an exam, I

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,390
might mentally explain this outcome to myself as: “I got a good result on that test because

15
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,390
the lecturer set a really easy exam”; not “I got a good result because I studied really

16
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,390
hard”.

17
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,570
On the other hand, if I do badly on the exam, I might say to myself &quot;I&#39;m dumb.

18
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,820
I&#39;m worthless.

19
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,520
I should have studied harder for that test.

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,060
I was totally underprepared.&quot;

21
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,530
I&#39;m not saying to myself, &quot;That test was pretty hard.

22
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,570
Everybody did badly on that test.&quot;
