When we consider the symptoms in the DSM criteria for Major Depression, note that other diseases

1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,660
could present with some of these symptoms.

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,300
So, we need to think about other potential explanations for the symptoms that the person

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,550
is displaying.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,310
I want to focus on one particular exclusion Criterion though, which specifies that we

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,689
need to be sure that the symptoms are not able to be explained by the physiological

6
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,790
effects of a substance or another medical condition.

7
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,670
If there is reason to believe that a person’s symptoms may be explained by the direct physiological

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,260
effects of substance use or a medical condition, appropriate investigations (whether this be

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:50,850
a tox screen or blood tests) should be conducted to rule out these possible causes.

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,289
People might show symptoms such as change in appetite, change in sleep patterns, difficulty

11
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:01,770
concentrating, reduced interest in previously enjoyed activities, and/or persistent sense

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,550
of sadness as a result of a medical condition.

13
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:11,740
For example, weight loss with untreated diabetes or fatigue, as a consequence of cancer.

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,140
People might also demonstrate some of these symptoms as a direct result of substance use.

15
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,490
As with all of the mental illness diagnoses, we need to be mindful in thinking about, &quot;Is

16
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,100
the diagnosis we are considering –– in this case, Major Depressive Disorder––

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,649
the most accurate way of explaining or thinking about this presentation?&quot;

18
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:37,689
For the same reason, this criterion also asks clinicians to consider whether the symptoms

19
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:41,820
would be better explained as a response to loss or grief.

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,960
Loss can take many forms – it could be a death, it could be financial ruin or the end

21
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,509
of a relationship.

22
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,719
In the context of considering a diagnosis of Major Depression, we need to be very mindful

23
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,969
of the possibility that the symptoms might be better accounted for by grief.

24
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:03,490
The last thing we want to do is pathologise a very normal process by slapping a diagnostic

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,049
label on it.

26
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:10,320
In some cases, however, the presenting symptoms persist for a long period of time, and in

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,040
these cases, the grief may have become a depressive disorder.
