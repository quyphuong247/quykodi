00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,900
The front-line intervention for schizophrenia is medication.

1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,220
People who have a symptom profile dominated by positive symptoms are more likely to have

2
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,760
a good response to anti-psychotic medication compared to people whose symptom profile is

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,580
dominated by negative symptoms.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,820
Although medications are very helpful in managing the symptoms of schizophrenia for many people,

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,620
up to one quarter of people with schizophrenia fail to demonstrate much improvement on medication.

6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,860
Both older and more recently developed anti-psychotic medications are associated with negative side

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,650
effects, including weight gain, and Tardive Dyskinesia––which is an involuntary neurological

8
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,170
movement disorder usually affecting the lower face.

9
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,480
From a psychological point of view, one of the most important elements of treatment is

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,620
Psycho-education.

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,200
Psycho-education would be done both with the person suffering from schizophrenia and their

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,360
family members.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,050
Some of the key things that we need to educate people who are directly impacted by the illness

14
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,610
about include the signs of relapse, and what to do if and when that happens.

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,159
Other psychological interventions include using behavioural strategies to help people

16
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,909
with schizophrenia develop their social skills, with a view to promote the development and

17
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,240
maintenance of social relationships and friendships.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Cognitive behavioural therapy is a therapeutic approach that has been recommended for individuals

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,560
with well-managed or stable schizophrenia by organisations such as the National Institute

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,020
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK and the American Psychiatric Association.

21
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,700
However, despite some very encouraging studies, a recent meta-analysis published in the British

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,159
Journal of Psychiatry indicates that the effect size of CBT on schizophrenic symptoms is likely

23
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,119
to be in the small range.

24
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,409
Finally, it is also vitally important to support the families of people with schizophrenia,

25
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:06,159
both in terms of their own coping and well-being, and also in terms of how to best help their

26
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,509
unwell family member.
