00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,160
So, what job would you consider to be the MOST stressful?

1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,100
Stress is defined as any circumstances that either threaten the individual’s well-being,

2
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,779
or that the individual perceives as threatening their well-being.

3
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,660
As a result, they require some sort of coping response to cope with the stress of the circumstance.

4
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,890
When I’ve asked a room full of students in the past: “What job would you consider

5
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,329
to be the MOST stressful?”, the job students mention that they would consider to be the

6
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,570
MOST stressful job has often been a BOMB DISPOSAL EXPERT.

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,670
Do YOU think the job of a bomb disposal expert would be really stressful?

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,820
Do you think it would be MORE stressful than someone working in a bar for example?

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:53,519
Well, in 2005, Alexander Haslam and colleagues actually asked bomb disposal experts how stressful

10
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:58,550
they found their job, and also asked people who worked in bars how stressful they thought

11
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,909
their job was.

12
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,989
They found that people who worked in bars actually found their job to be MORE stressful

13
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,189
than those who worked in bomb disposal.

14
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:13,000
Haslam concluded that the reason for this is that, bomb disposal experts work in a tight-knit

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,329
team, and so they have each other for support.

16
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,500
They also have a lot of job control, and have a lot of control over their risk.

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,770
As a result, they don’t perceive their jobs as being very stressful.

18
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,759
Whereas, those working in the service industry, like in bars, actually find their jobs to

19
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:29,770
be stressful.

20
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,720
So, it seems that jobs or events themselves are not inherently stressful.

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,969
Let me ask you a different question: “Have you ever been skydiving?”

22
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,970
Those of you who have, probably thought that it was fun?

23
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,830
When looking at this photo of people skydiving, it looks fun!

24
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,979
Would anyone want to go skydiving because it looks terrifying and stress-inducing?

25
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,979
Probably not!

26
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,799
But, skydiving is not for everyone though.

27
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,619
The same event, skydiving, can be appraised as fun and a great way to spend your weekend

28
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,810
or ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.

29
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,440
There’s pretty much nothing you could say that would ever convince me to go skydiving!

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,050
So, what’s stressful or not depends on our appraisal.

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,970
Folkman identified two different types of appraisals that are important for dealing

32
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,890
with stress: Primary appraisal, and secondary appraisal.

33
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,420
Primary appraisal refers to the evaluation of whether a stressor is perceived as a threat

34
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,890
or a challenge.

35
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,343
For example, when studying for an exam, if the individual perceives the stress of the

36
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:38,690
exam as a threat, they might think that everybody’s going to find out how they have been slacking

37
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,670
off during the semester, and how they haven’t really studied for the exam.

38
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,240
They might think: “This is going to be terrible.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,600
I’m going to do badly in the exam.”

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,370
That’s a threat appraisal, and it is negative and highly stressful.

41
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,980
On the other hand, if the individual perceives exam stress as a challenge, they might see

42
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,920
it as an opportunity to demonstrate how much they know about the exam topic, and how hard

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,450
they have been working.

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,700
They perceive the stress as an opportunity rather than a threat.

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,480
The challenge appraisal is much more positive.

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,700
Secondary appraisal refers to the evaluation of whether the individual has the necessary

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,730
skills and resources for dealing with the stressor.

48
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,540
Secondary appraisal does not only refer to the evaluation of whether the individual has

49
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,810
the SKILLS to deal with the stressor, but also the resources around them.

50
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,090
So for example, are there people who can help the individual when they need help?

51
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,730
Therefore, it’s both the individual’s skills and whether they have the social support

52
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,730
to cope with the stress.

53
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,370
If the individual doesn’t think that they have the individual skills and that they can’t

54
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,650
get the necessary social support, they will appraise a stressful situation as being REALLY

55
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,650
stressful.

56
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,010
It’s also worth remembering that stress can be an everyday thing, or it can result

57
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,560
from one-off events.

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,950
Losing your phone can be stressful.

59
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,820
Not being able to get a park when you go to the shops can be stressful and annoying.

60
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,400
Having a deadline for something can be really stressful.

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,860
A natural disaster can be really stressful.

62
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,160
However, what makes something stressful REALLY depends on WHO the perceiver is, and how they

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,150
PERCEIVE the stressful situation.
