00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,940
Another thing that people thought might cause stress is change.

1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,920
Stress related to change is the idea that any change in someone’s life, regardless

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,230
of whether the change is positive or negative, would produce some sort of readjustment in

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,269
their life that could produce stress.

4
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:25,050
So, positive changes like being offered a job at a ski resort, or negative changes like

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,610
getting a really bad toothache, could both produce stress.

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,260
Social Readjustment Rating Scale is the measure used to assess change in people’s life.

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,860
This scale was developed by Holmes and Rahe back in 1967.

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,199
It’s got 42 items, let’s just look at the first 10.

9
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,719
1) Marriage 2) Troubles with the boss

10
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,530
3) Detention in jail or other institution 4) Death of spouse

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,179
5) Major change in sleeping habits 6) Death of a close family member

12
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,019
7) Major change in eating habits 8) Foreclosure on a mortgage or loan

13
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:03,320
9) Revision of personal habits and

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,630
10) Death of a close friend

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,550
Most of these are clearly negative changes in someone’s life.

16
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,750
When you actually look at the research and make the distinction between positive events

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,460
and negative events, there’s no evidence that change by itself produces stress.

18
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,510
It’s mainly negative events in someone’s life that produce stress.

19
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,320
Positive change doesn’t seem to produce stress in the same way as negative change.

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,180
Now, the fourth thing that people can cause stress is pressure.

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,710
Pressure comes from people’s expectations for behaviour.

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,990
Pressure can come from a variety of sources.

23
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,970
For example, from a job where there’s expectations to perform in a certain way.

24
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,880
From peer group pressure, like going to school prom because your friends are going.

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,210
And from self-imposed pressure, or from parents, to do well at school.

26
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,230
When you look at what produces stress, PRESSURE seems to be more strongly related to the experience

27
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,000
of stress than things like change.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,950
PRESSURE seems to be something that does produce stress.

29
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,280
As we mentioned, there are four types of stress: frustration, conflict, change and pressure.

30
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,590
We’ve got potentially stressful events like: a major exam, a new date, or maybe trouble

31
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,099
with the boss.

32
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,959
These events might lead to stress through either frustration, conflict, change, or pressure.

33
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,060
We’ve talked about the subjective cognitive appraisal, where people’s experience of

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,999
those events are not always the same.

35
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:35,150
Whether they experience an event as stressful or not is a function of their appraisals,

36
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,590
their primary and secondary appraisal.

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,540
Is this thing a threat to me or a challenge to be overcome?

38
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,909
Do I have the coping resources I need?

39
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,810
The appraisal is influenced by a few different things.

40
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,459
One of them is our familiarity with the event.

41
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,510
For example, the first time you sit in an exam at a university, it’s likely that you

42
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,280
will appraise that as being stressful.

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,569
By the time you get to end of your third year at the same university, it’s likely that

44
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,889
you will have a less negative appraisal for exams compared to before.

45
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:11,090
And as a result, exams don’t tend to produce the same amount of stress as they did before.

46
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,989
Controllability and predictability also produce more positive appraisals.

47
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,870
We don’t find things that are controllable or predictable as stressful as things that

48
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,639
are not controllable or predictable.

49
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,310
In a moment, we will focus on how we respond to things that we find stressful.

50
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,689
We will talk about our emotional responses, our physiological responses, and our behavioural

51
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:31,689
responses.

52
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:34,310
But first, we have a quick activity for you.

53
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,719
Let’s see how well you go in identify what might make us stressed in different contexts.
