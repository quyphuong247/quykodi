Have you ever had an emotional melt down when something bad happened to you?

1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,900
Let’s be real, we&#39;ve all had one at some stage in our life.

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,820
So what emotional responses do we have to stress?

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,460
Well, the common emotions that people have reported are things like annoyance, anger,

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:30,259
rage, apprehension, anxiety, fear, dejection, sadness, and grief.

5
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,420
People don’t report all of those emotions at the same time.

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,660
For example, if someone is completing a stressful exam, they’re not going to necessarily feel

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,050
anger and rage along with all of the other emotions, well I hope not, otherwise it could

8
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,390
mean trouble.

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,860
But they might have a bit of apprehension and anxiety.

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,710
So why would we experience these strong negative emotions when we are stressed?

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,760
It doesn’t sound very functional to have to experience these unpleasant emotions.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,880
But it turns out, they can be useful, because they can act as an alarm signal.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,830
Why do you think we need an alarm signal when we’re experiencing stress?

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,860
Think about what we mean by stress… remember it’s something that potentially threatens

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,500
us and needs some kind of response from us.

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,640
In a lot of cases, this might be something dangerous.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,460
So the strong emotions we experience in response to stress are a lot like an alarm signal warning

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,229
us about danger.

19
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:27,570
So these strong negative emotions are warning us that we need to do something about whatever

20
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,870
it is in the environment that is making us stressed.

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,880
Maybe run away from that bear?

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,600
However, a somewhat paradoxical problem is that these strong emotions can actually interfere

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,870
with our attention, our memory, our judgment, and our decision-making.

24
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,271
So, strong emotions to stress can alert us to action, but then these emotions can also

25
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:52,890
make it difficult for us to act in the appropriate way––particularly with some of the things

26
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,260
that produce stress for us nowadays.

27
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,610
For example, if you’re in an exam, it’s really important that you attend to the exam

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,040
questions and figure out what the questions are asking you.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,870
To answer the question well, you will need to remember the material you’ve studied,

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,240
and be able to formulate the answer.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,349
If you’re highly stressed, it’s going to be harder to do all that because of how

32
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,730
stress induced emotions interfere with your attention and memory.
