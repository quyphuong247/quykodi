0
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,340
So, looking at those four pairs of shapes, were you able to work out which pair of shapes

1
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,060
is the odd one out?

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,920
What is your reason for why this pair is the odd one out?

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,060
Did you think this pair is the odd one out?

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,300
Why do you think this one is the odd one out?

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,289
Maybe because this is the only one without a curve?

6
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:27,050
That seems like a sensible rule, potentially.

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,220
What about this one?

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,050
Does this one fit with the others?

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,859
It doesn&#39;t, does it?

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,460
This is actually the odd one out.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,820
But what&#39;s the rule?

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,700
Well, they have no straight edges.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,980
But that’s not the rule.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,359
If you look at the set of shapes as a whole, the rule is that for each pair, they are mirror

15
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:48,260
images of each other, reflected on the vertical axis.

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,899
The odd one out, is not a mirror image.

17
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,950
What we have done here is what Spearman would have suggested is influenced by the “G”

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,950
factor.

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,319
We could look at these shapes and figure out that they&#39;re actually two distinct shapes

20
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:01,280
that we had to compare.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
He called this apprehension of experience.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,250
We were able to compare them and look at what was consistent across the shapes and work

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,920
out what the rule is.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,640
This is what he referred to as eduction of relations.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,740
We were then able to apply the rule to all of them, and figure out which was the odd

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,890
one out.

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,759
This final step is called eduction of correlates.

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
Let&#39;s take a look at another set of shapes.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,210
Can you pick out which is the odd one out?

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,640
Do you think it’s the first one?

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,689
Second one?

32
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,740
Third or fourth?

33
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,280
This one is the odd one out.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,689
This isn’t a trick question!

35
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,229
It’s likely that it was much easier for you to pick out the odd shape in this second

36
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,670
example.

37
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,369
Did you have to think about your reason for why that shape was the odd one?

38
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:46,460
Probably not.

39
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,560
Perceptually, it’s likely that it just popped out as being different and that you didn&#39;t

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,580
have to do any thinking.

41
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,750
This type of task doesn’t require G. “G” requires the individual to think through and

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,920
provide reasoning for why a shape is the odd one out.

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,000
Here&#39;s another example of a test designed to assess “G” effectively.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,320
This is from Raven&#39;s Progressive Matrices.

45
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,560
What it does is, it helps you measure people&#39;s ability to understand what they&#39;re perceiving

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,750
and then applying it to novel stimuli to work out what the missing bits are.

47
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,950
There are different versions for different age groups.

48
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,690
This is a nonverbal test, so it doesn&#39;t have a lot of the problems that the WAIS has in

49
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,620
terms of the assumed knowledge underlying the test.

50
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,360
This test has often been used in the selection of people for jobs.

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,690
Especially for the military for the war effort in the middle of the 20th century - a lot

52
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,940
of the people they were recruiting hadn’t completed a lot of formal schooling so they

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,720
needed a test that didn’t rely on being about to read and write to a high level.

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,420
What you have to do is look at this progression of shapes and figure out which is the missing

55
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
one.

56
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,060
In this example, we should see a diamond shape with the box to the right coloured in.

57
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,850
What&#39;s the rule?

58
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,370
The rule is that the shapes are rotating.

59
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,320
We can work out what the rule is just by looking at this.

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,340
Then, we can generate the missing bit by applying the rule to this sequence.

61
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,130
That&#39;s supposed to assess “G”.

62
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,480
It&#39;s a good test of general cognitive functioning.
