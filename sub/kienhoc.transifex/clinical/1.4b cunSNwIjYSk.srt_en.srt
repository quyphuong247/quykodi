00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,510
Randomised Controlled Trials are typically regarded as the ‘gold standard’ or highest

1
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,640
threshold of evidence when evaluating an intervention.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,650
They should be registered on a national or international clinical trials register, where

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,480
the full protocol for the trial should be outlined.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,289
The criteria for including and excluding participants must be specified clearly, as must recruitment

5
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,210
procedures themselves.

6
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,579
Participants must be randomly assigned to conditions, with the conditions clearly described.

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,640
Conditions may be an active intervention, a placebo or a wait list control––in which

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,550
participants receive no treatment.

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,550
Assessment is conducted both before and after the intervention has been completed.

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,250
In addition to post-treatment assessment, which occurs right after the intervention

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,280
has been completed, follow-up points – for instance, 6 and 12 months after the intervention

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,320
has been completed – are usually specified.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,060
Finally, a Randomised Controlled Trial needs to have enough participants to be able to

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,650
detect a difference between conditions if such a difference exists – in other words,

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,970
statistically; it needs to be adequately powered.

16
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,520
Diagrammatically, this is an example of a Randomised Controlled Trial.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,840
In this example, participants with a similar presenting problem have been randomly assigned

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,760
to either the active intervention “Psychotherapy” or “no treatment”, otherwise known as

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,440
a wait list control condition.

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,200
Participants in a wait list control condition receive no treatment for the duration of the

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,330
active intervention being evaluated.

22
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,960
So, if our psychotherapy condition consists of 12 weekly sessions, the wait list condition

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,190
would go without treatment for 12 weeks, at which point they would be re-assessed to determine

24
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,790
whether the passage of time alone had made any difference to their symptoms.

25
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,860
Once this has happened, participants in the wait list control condition receive an active

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,310
intervention, because it would be unethical to withhold treatment.
