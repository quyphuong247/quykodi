00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,340
So how can we tell whether there is a single thing called intelligence, or G, or whether

1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,200
there are multiple things called intelligence?

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,140
One way might be to do a little demonstration.

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,019
So we could look at a couple of my abilities and see how related they are.

4
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:26,280
I’ve got a PhD in psychology, which might mean I’d score high on logical/mathematical

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,190
intelligence, so according to the general intelligence approach I should also be good

6
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,320
at some other subskills, let’s say music.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,039
So it should be a walk in the park for me to sing you Taylor Swift’s I knew you were

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,559
trouble when you walked in.

9
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,880
But I can’t, because I don’t have an instrument.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
Oh dear!

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,519
Well, I can tell you I’m a terrible singer, and I can’t play this thing to save my life.

12
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:51,550
So there’s no need to actually do the demonstration.

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,569
Trust me, you’ll thank me later.

14
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:56,999
There must be a more systematic way to test this idea though.

15
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:00,570
Spearman was one of the first to start thinking about the problem of figuring out whether

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,969
intelligence is one thing or multiple things.

17
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,310
Based on an analysis of how people performed on a number of tests of intelligence, Spearman

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,960
proposed the Two Factor Theory of Intelligence.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,780
He thought that people&#39;s performance on tests was a function of two factors.

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,550
One is the “G” factor, which is general factor or general intelligence.

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,710
The other is the “S” factor, which is specific intellectual abilities.

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,550
Now, Spearman thought that general intelligence “G” influences our general performance

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:36,010
on ALL mental tasks, while the specific abilities “S” refers to our unique individual abilities

24
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,760
on a particular task.

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,200
He thought that we all had more or less general intelligence “G”, but “S” varied from

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,130
person to person on a particular task.

27
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,260
Here is an example of how it works.

28
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,430
I would like you to look at these pairs of shapes.

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,370
Can you figure out which pair of shapes is the odd one out?

30
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,240
Think of your reason for why that pair is the odd one out.
