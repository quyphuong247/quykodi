In Western nations, one in five people will have a mental illness across the course of

1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,750
their lifespan.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,600
What this means is that, statistically, it is actually incredibly unlikely that any of us will

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,500
get to the end of our lives without being personally touched by mental illness.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,880
The type of disorder experienced will vary depending on factors such as age, gender and

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,750
cultural background.

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,180
Some people will experience short-lived illnesses and others will experience episodic illnesses

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,370
from which they never fully recover.

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:43,079
Currently, only about half of all people who experience a mental illness receive any kind

9
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,149
of intervention––evidence-based or otherwise.

10
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,200
Perhaps you will personally experience a diagnosable mental illness, or perhaps someone you care

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,399
about will.

12
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,450
There is a possibility that both will happen.

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:02,840
Mental illness has no respect for social class, intelligence, money, appearance or personality.

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,600
It can and it will touch each of us.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,079
And yet, for a set of conditions that are so very common, there is still far too much

16
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,619
stigma around mental illness.

17
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,310
Still a sense of “us” and “them”.

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,920
This is a fallacy of course, but one that too many people continue to buy into.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,460
Stigma is a major obstacle to treatment among people struggling with a mental illness.

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,270
You don’t need to work in the area of mental illness to make a difference.

21
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,779
Each and every one of us can help when it comes to breaking down the stigma and prejudice

22
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,479
associated with mental illness.

23
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,469
It’s about recognising that mental illness is something that any of us can experience.

24
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,439
There is no ‘us’ and ‘them’.

25
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,920
There’s just ‘us’.
