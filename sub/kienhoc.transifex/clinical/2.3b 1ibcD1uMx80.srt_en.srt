00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,040
Some of us are scared of spiders.

1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,180
Are you?

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,120
How do we know when we’re actually phobic or just a little bit scared?

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:19,019
People with a Specific Phobia demonstrate a really high level of fear, anxiety, or avoidance

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,789
in relation to very specific, circumscribed situations or objects.

5
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,810
So, essentially, we are talking about very specific fears that are out of all proportion

6
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,900
to any actual danger.

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,660
With children and adolescents, the fear may be manifested as behaviours such as crying,

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,390
tantrums and clinging.

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,440
The most common types of phobic stimuli––and in fact, these are diagnostic specifiers––are:

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,220
animals, for example, snakes, the natural environment, for example, storms,

11
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:59,250
Blood-injection-injury, for example, injections, Situational, for example, enclosed spaces,

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,869
and other situations, for example, situations that a person associates with choking or vomiting.

13
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:10,790
In order to meet the diagnostic criteria for a Specific Phobia, a person must demonstrate

14
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,579
this extreme fear or anxiety about a specific situation or object almost always when confronted

15
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,999
with the phobic object or situation.

16
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:26,609
The phobic stimulus is either avoided or endured with intense anxiety, which is out of proportion

17
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,299
to any actual danger posed by the stimulus.

18
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,399
Finally, the fear, anxiety or avoidance must have been experienced for 6 months or longer,

19
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,689
must cause clinically significant distress or interference; and must not be better explained

20
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:44,560
by symptoms of another mental illness.

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,310
Specific Phobia is a disorder that usually develops in early childhood, with most cases

22
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,679
actually beginning before the age of 10.

23
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:57,069
When we look at children, the prevalence rate for Specific Phobia is around 5%, going up

24
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:59,850
to 16% in adolescents.

25
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,680
Once we look beyond adolescence, the prevalence rate comes down to around 3-5%.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,700
Specific Phobia affects twice as many females compared to males – and this is a theme

27
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,310
that we will see throughout the anxiety disorders.
