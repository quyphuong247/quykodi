0
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,800
Let&#39;s imagine that we measure the height from a bunch of people and graph them.

1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,230
It might look a little like this.

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,680
The average height here is 170cm.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,740
The average height is directly in the middle of the distribution here.

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,619
I&#39;ve conveniently marked off the standard deviation, which is 10 cms.

5
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:28,679
This represents how much the scores vary around the mean.

6
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,150
You can see, just visually inspecting the normal distribution, that a lot of scores

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,620
seem to clump close to the mean.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,280
There are fewer scores further out in the region from one to two standard deviations,

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,960
and there are even fewer scores out beyond two standard deviations, and so on.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,190
Because it&#39;s a normal distribution, if we find somebody, measure their height, and it

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,890
turns out that their height is 180cms, we can now work out whether they are tall or

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,800
not, relative to everybody else in our population of interest.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,420
The way we do that is we convert the height values into standardised scores, in other

14
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,570
words we convert the distribution of scores into a standard normal distribution.

15
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,299
The standard normal distribution is just a normal distribution where the mean is zero

16
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,340
and the standard deviation is one.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,810
The way we convert height to a standard score is by subtracting the mean, so 170, from the

18
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,060
height value, and dividing it by the standard deviation, which is 10.

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,130
For example, someone with a height of 180cms will now have a standardised score of 1 on

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,810
this standard normal distribution.

21
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,009
It’s clear to see here that they’re one standard deviation above the mean.

22
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,149
Now, we can tell how small or large this score is because we know the properties of the standard

23
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:47,189
normal distribution.

24
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,749
For example, we know that about 68 percent of scores are within the region of plus or

25
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:55,350
minus one standard deviation.

26
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,020
We know that about 95 percent are within two standard deviations.

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,969
Pretty much most of the scores are within three standard deviations.

28
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:09,319
With this information, we can work out how tall a 180cm person is by working out the

29
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,590
area under the curve up to that one standard deviation point.

30
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,860
All we have to do is add up the proportion of scores in this green region.

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,420
We know that this first proportion here represents half of the standard normal distribution,

32
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,140
so that&#39;s 50% of the scores.

33
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,540
We also know that the additional portion is half of the region between plus and minus

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,080
one standard deviation.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,910
So, half of 68% is 34%.

36
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:40,140
We can just add these together to work out that our person who is 180 cms tall is taller

37
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,940
than 84% of people.

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,610
That’s pretty tall!

39
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,200
We could SAY that this person is taller than the majority of people.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,690
This is why it’s important to standardise tests like intelligence tests, because, standardised

41
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,290
tests provide us with the information that helps us to work out exactly how somebody

42
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,200
has performed on a test.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,780
This information is incredibly useful!
