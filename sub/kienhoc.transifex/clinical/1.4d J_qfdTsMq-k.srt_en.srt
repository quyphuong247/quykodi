00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,720
Here, on the y axis, we have the percentage of children who were free of an anxiety diagnosis.

1
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,910
On the x axis, we have the three conditions: the control/wait list, the therapist-supported

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,279
bibliotherapy, and the individual therapy groups.

3
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,150
The blue indicates evaluation immediately post treatment.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,310
The green indicates evaluation three months later.

5
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,309
The yellow indicates evaluation six months later.

6
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:34,580
The results showed that there was no difference in the percentage of children who were free

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,430
of an anxiety diagnosis between the bibliotherapy group and the individual therapy group, regardless

8
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,890
of the timepoints at which the children were evaluated.

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,300
Children in both of these groups improved after the cognitive behavioural intervention.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,440
However, those in the wait list condition did not improve just with the passage of time.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,490
Given that only 18% of children with an anxiety disorder ever receive any kind of intervention,

12
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,479
these results suggest that therapist-supported bibliotherapy represents a cost-effective

13
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,870
means of potentially reaching a greater number of children suffering from anxiety.
