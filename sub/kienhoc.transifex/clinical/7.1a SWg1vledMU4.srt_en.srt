00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,639
So, what motivates the expression of personality that we see in the way people behave?

1
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,090
The first theory I would like to talk about is Psychoanalytic Theory.

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,999
This is a pretty well-known theory, originally put forward by Sigmund Freud.

3
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,580
This theory has been very popular in the media.

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,169
Often, when people think about Psychology, they think about Sigmund Freud––even though

5
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:28,609
he wasn&#39;t a Psychologist.

6
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,689
He was a neurologist from Austria and the founder of psychoanalysis.

7
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,840
He had three core principles underlying his psychoanalytic theory.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,710
The first one was psychic determinism.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,519
In other words, all psychological events have a cause.

10
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:47,970
This is the idea that we&#39;re not free to choose our own actions because we&#39;re at the mercy

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,940
of powerful forces that lie outside our conscious level of awareness.

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,739
Most of our behaviour is driven by unconscious processes and not by our own conscious choices.

13
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,000
Freud thought things like dreams, erotic symptoms, and what we call Freudian slips of the tongue,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,970
are all reflections of deep psychological conflicts that occasionally bubble to the

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,390
surface.

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:16,020
Dream analysis is driven, partly, by psychoanalysts thinking that&#39;s what gives you a window into

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,890
people’s underlying psyche.

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,520
The second principle is symbolic meaning.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,149
This refers to the ideas that no action, however trivial, is meaningless and that we can come

20
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:31,860
up with an explanation or we can find meaning in most behaviours.

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,220
For Freud, most behaviours had some kind of sexual meaning.

22
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,060
Although it may not be a true story, there&#39;s an anecdote that he admitted that symbolic

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,979
meaning could be taken too far, because someone was joking around and asked him why he enjoyed

24
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,000
smoking cigars so much, and he said, &quot;Look, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,740
It&#39;s not a phallic symbol,&quot; so yes, it can be taken too literally.

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,469
The third principle is unconscious motivation.

27
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,250
Unconscious motivation refers to the idea that we rarely understand what we do, even

28
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,310
if we seem to be able to explain it after the fact.

29
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,580
To understand Freud’s principles of unconscious motivation, you can think about the mind as

30
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,360
being like an iceberg, and that we can only really see the tip of it.

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,280
The conscious mind is that bit of the psyche that&#39;s above the water.

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,420
That&#39;s where our thoughts and perceptions reside that we&#39;ve got access to.

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,170
The pre-conscious level is just below the water.

34
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,290
That&#39;s where our memories are stored and knowledge resides, and with some effort we can bring

35
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,360
those into conscious awareness.

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,730
But, the vast majority of it is outside of our level of awareness, deeper under the water.

37
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,160
The conscious mind is the thing that we&#39;re aware of, but we&#39;re not aware of everything

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,730
else that&#39;s happening down there in the deep water.

39
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,000
Freud suggested that the unconscious mind was the most important in terms of explaining

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,420
personality, more so than the conscious mind.

41
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,630
At the unconscious level, you&#39;ve got your fears, your violent motives, your moral urges,

42
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,470
your selfish needs, and so on.

43
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:08,590
According to Freud, our urges for food, power, water, and sex reside in our id, at the unconscious

44
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,810
level.

45
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,120
Freud thought the id was the most primitive, instinctive component operating on the pleasure

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
principle.

47
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,790
It would seek immediate gratification for all those immoral urges that are going through

48
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,030
our minds.

49
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,030
So, the id is one component of our psyche, which is at the unconscious level.

50
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,280
The ego is generally something we&#39;re aware of at the conscious level.

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,450
The ego is supposed to be the boss of the personality.

52
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,810
This is really the decision-making component.

53
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,290
Because it has to deal with reality, it&#39;s restrained by the reality principle, and will

54
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,070
seek delayed gratification.

55
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,370
So, it&#39;s trying to find ways to hold the id off until there are more appropriate ways

56
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,290
to express those base level of desires.

57
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,480
The superego which is at all levels of awareness.

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,180
The superego, which develops at around age three to five represents society&#39;s moral standards.

59
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,490
It&#39;s the moral component.

60
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,190
It can operate at all those different levels of conscious awareness.

61
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,950
And it really represents what&#39;s right or wrong.
