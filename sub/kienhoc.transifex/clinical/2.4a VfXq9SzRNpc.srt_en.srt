So, we know that anxiety runs in families.

1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,250
If you have a first degree relative with an anxiety disorder, your odds of developing

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,800
an anxiety disorder increase compared to the general population.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,649
What I want to discuss are some of the common features across anxiety disorders.

4
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,999
Historically, twin studies have indicated that heritability accounts for upwards of

5
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:33,550
30-40% of the variance in the development of anxiety disorders (Hettema et al., 2001).

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,030
Temperament – an innate rather than learned aspect of personality – has been found to

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,540
be important in the development of anxiety disorders.

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,010
In particular, the temperamental quality of behavioural inhibition––characterised

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,570
by shyness, fear of unfamiliar situations and withdrawal––has been identified as

10
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,730
an important risk factor.

14
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,690
Important environmental factors include exposure to potentially traumatic events, an accumulation

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,829
of stressful life events, and parenting behaviours, such as modelling and overprotection.

23
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:11,829
However, as we have seen with other categories of disorders, increasingly, there is a consensus

24
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:16,469
that the best way of understanding how anxiety disorders develop is by considering the ways

25
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,789
in which biological risks may interact with environmental triggers.
