0
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,860
A lot of times older people will be worried and ask me, &quot;You know, I forgot where my keys

1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,889
are.

2
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,920
Is that Alzheimer&#39;s disease?&quot;

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,160
I forget where my keys are all the time and I&#39;ve done it since I was in my 20s.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,860
If you forget where your keys are, that sort of forgetting is a part of normal aging.

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,380
If you have somebody with dementia and you put the keys in their hand, they won&#39;t know

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,570
what keys are called and they won&#39;t know what they are for.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,640
So there’s a big difference, between normal forgetfulness and dementia.

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,080
Dementia is the most common mental illness in later life.

9
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,350
I get a lot of questions about dementia.

10
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,000
Probably the most common question is, &quot;What&#39;s the difference between dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,720
disease?&quot;

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,100
Alzheimer&#39;s disease is one kind of dementia.

13
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,960
It&#39;s the most prevalent kind.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,040
Between 50 to 70 percent of all dementias can be attributed to Alzheimer&#39;s disease.

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,460
Alzheimer&#39;s disease is characterized by changes in memory, and such changes are what most

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,070
people associate with dementia.

17
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,400
Dementia is the umbrella category for a whole range of progressive neurological illnesses

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,650
that are characterized by changes in thinking, and personality, and behaviour.

19
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:42,800
So, dementia is not just one symptom, and different people can manifest different symptoms.

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:50,580
It involves intellectual impairment, usually memory, but also language and executive functions

21
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,390
such as goal setting can be affected.

22
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,450
A good definition of dementia is that it is an acquired syndrome of intellectual impairment

23
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,909
produced by brain dysfunction.

24
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:12,120
We know dementia mostly affects people over 65, although you can get early onset dementia

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,560
in your 30s and 40s.

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,959
That usually occurs in families where there&#39;s a strong genetic heritability.

27
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,130
In most forms of dementia there is some degree of heritability.

28
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:31,170
But for most dementias in most people, the genetic influence on risk is relatively small.

29
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:38,319
It is nowhere near, for example, the fact that smoking doubles your risk of dementia.

30
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,240
Lifestyle risk factors can be much more influential than your genes.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,320
The prevalence for dementia is about six to seven percent in most developed countries.

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,600
Dementia is not part of primary aging.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,040
All dementias stem from a disease process.

34
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,599
This slice of brain on the slide illustrates this.

35
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,070
On the left side is a brain of a 70 year old with Alzheimer’s Disease.

36
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,209
On the right side is a normal 70 year old brain.

37
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,910
You can see a big difference in the disease process, versus normal aging.

38
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,780
It&#39;s very clear.

39
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,590
Now, early dementia signs can be subtle, but they usually quickly develop into something

40
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,250
that is, categorically, not normal.

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,270
This is how it plays out.

42
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,849
Sometimes you forget a name or an appointment, that&#39;s normal aging.

43
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,340
If you increasingly cannot remember things —even when people remind you, or give you

44
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,670
hints—that is more likely to be dementia.

45
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:51,630
This abnormal change is because what is being processed within the brain is no longer reliably

46
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:58,580
stored in the brain, due to cellular changes in the brain resulting from the disease process.

47
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,730
We sometimes have trouble finding a word for something.

48
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,490
That&#39;s normal aging.

49
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:09,430
If you forget the names of very common things, if you forget the names of close relatives,

50
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,630
that&#39;s more likely to be dementia.

51
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,810
If you&#39;re a little bit more irritable, when somebody makes you the wrong kind of coffee

52
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,870
in a café, that&#39;s probably normal aging.

53
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,430
You get used to certain things, and you&#39;ve gone to that same café, ordering the same

54
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,770
coffee, and, well, you want your coffee the way you like it.

55
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,759
You did not order that latté, so you get a little irritated.

56
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,360
People with dementia have really big changes in personality.

57
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,250
Somebody who is an introvert becomes very extroverted or the reverse; it&#39;s a very stark

58
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,979
change.

59
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:53,500
Usually, with normal aging, familiar tasks remain quite robust.

60
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,599
If you have a favourite recipe and you cook that all the time and you&#39;re known for it,

61
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,880
normal aging isn&#39;t going to affect that.

62
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,969
If you have dementia, you&#39;ll start forgetting ingredients, forgetting the steps, even though

63
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:11,999
you&#39;ve done it thousands of times.

64
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:16,419
There&#39;s a real clear difference there.

65
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:22,210
Often when older adults present at their GP or primary care physician, they may complain

66
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,840
of decreased memory.

67
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,779
It might be that they are worried about dementia, but are really only experiencing slower recall

68
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,969
of memories – a primary aging change.

69
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:40,529
Unfortunately, health professionals often leap to the conclusion that dementia is the

70
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:47,120
cause for many kinds of cognitive changes associated with primary ageing.

71
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,719
Mild forgetting and slower speed of thinking are a normal part of aging which do not interfere

72
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,339
with everyday life significantly– though they are annoying!

73
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:05,330
But dementia is qualitatively different – as is the motor speed loss associated with a

74
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,710
disease like Parkinson’s disease.

75
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:13,870
And just as in early life, both depression and anxiety are associated with changes in

76
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,289
memory.

77
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:21,159
But if older adults are diagnosed – actually I might say labeled – with dementia, when

78
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:26,349
that is not what they are experiencing, then it robs them of the chance to get the proper

79
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,349
treatment.

80
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:33,340
It also means that older adults do not receive advice on healthy lifestyle changes, such

81
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,490
as quitting smoking or taking up exercise – that can decrease their risk for a range

82
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,129
of illnesses, including dementia.

83
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:47,569
That&#39;s why these ideas about primary and secondary aging are important.

84
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:52,889
All people – including health professionals - should understand what is expected later

85
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:59,110
in life and may have to be adapted to, and what is possibly due to an illness or condition

86
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,599
which can be treated or possibly even prevented.
