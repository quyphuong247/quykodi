00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,920
One way we can investigate what causes personality is through twin studies.

1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,360
These studies get at the whole issue of nature versus nurture, which has been big in developmental

2
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:17,369
psychology.

3
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,439
Twin studies are useful because they compare the personalities of twins who are identical

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,450
twins or monozygotic twins, to twins who are fraternal twins or dizygotic twins.

5
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,850
Now, monozygotic twins share a lot more genetic material than dizygotic twins.

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,050
That&#39;s because monozygotic twins come about from a single egg that’s fertilised by a

7
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,500
single sperm, whereas, dizygotic twins are from two eggs and two sperm.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,630
What happens is, at some point early on, when the cells are separating, monozygotic twins

9
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:54,420
come about because the group of cells split and two separate fetuses develop, whereas,

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,329
dizygotic twins are always two separate groups of cells developing into two fetuses in the

11
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,640
placenta.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,040
Monozygotic twins often share a placenta, while dizygotic twins often have separate

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
placentas.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,550
Now, it&#39;s not to say that monozygotic twins share a hundred percent of genetic material,

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,840
because there are some mutations that happen after cell separation.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,940
But, they share a lot more genetic material than dizygotic twins.

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,370
Dizygotic twins share the same amount of material as any two siblings who were born at any point

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,370
in time.

19
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,100
They are just two siblings who happen to be born very close in time.

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,170
So, we can compare the personalities of people who come from identical genetic backgrounds

21
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,990
versus those who come from similar but not identical genetic backgrounds.

22
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,690
It turns out, sometimes twins are raised in the same family environment, and sometimes,

23
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,270
for a whole variety of reasons, twins are separated and raised in different family environments.

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,710
Tellegen and colleagues conducted a study in 1988 where they looked at the similarities

25
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,420
in personality between twins who were raised in the same family environment and those who

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,610
were raised in different family environments.

27
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,330
So, they recruited twins who were reared together in the same family environment, and those

28
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,810
who were reared apart.

29
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,479
For those who were reared together, they recruited siblings who were either identical or fraternal

30
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,479
twins.

31
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,400
The same from those who were reared apart.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,269
These were the personality dimensions that the twins were compared on... anxiety proneness,

33
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:25,549
aggression, alienation, impulse control, emotional well-being, traditionalism, and achievement

34
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,169
orientation.

35
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:32,150
Tellegen and colleagues measured the correlations between the twins’ scores on these dimensions.

36
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,599
A larger number means that as one of the twins scored higher on a personality dimension,

37
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,309
the more the other would score higher as well.

38
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:43,969
And likewise, as one of the twins scored lower, the other would also tend to score lower.

39
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:48,939
So, the higher the correlation, the more similar twins were on that personality dimension.

40
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:55,879
A correlation of .52 is moderate to high, and suggests, as one twin scored higher on

41
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,480
anxiety proneness, their twin sibling scored high on anxiety proneness as well.

42
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,409
Looking at those correlations, what do you notice?

43
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,739
It seems fairly obvious that the identical twins were more similar to one another than

44
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,329
the fraternal twins.

45
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,700
The correlations for the identical twins are larger than the correlations for the fraternal

46
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,129
twins, and this is the same whether they were reared together or apart.

47
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:23,530
So, the identical twins were similar to each other whether they were reared together or

48
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,760
apart.

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,439
These results suggest that GENES are a relatively bigger contributor to personality than shared

50
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,569
environment.

51
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,631
Another thing to take notice here is that, none of the correlations here are perfect.

52
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,129
A perfect correlation is ONE.

53
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,120
The strongest correlation from these results is .61.

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,079
If we work out the amount of VARIANCE explained by a correlation, by squaring the correlation,

55
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:53,230
it works out to be 0.37, which means that genetics explains about a third of the shared variance

56
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,099
in personality between identical twins.

57
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,229
This leaves two thirds of the variance unexplained––and it doesn&#39;t seem to be the shared environment.

58
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:06,120
I would like to tell you what it is, but nobody really knows for sure, although the best guess

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,889
at the moment is unshared environmental factors, such as going to different schools and so

60
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:11,889
on.

61
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,239
The point is that genes are a bigger contributor than a shared environment, but they&#39;re not

62
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,519
the only factor contributing to personality.

63
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,910
Part of it might also come down to the idea that personality is really a function of the

64
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,410
person and their environment––like the situation they&#39;re in.

65
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,560
So the situation contributes to how personality is expressed.

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,670
Here is another set of data that supports the same conclusion, which was published by

67
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,340
Scarr and colleagues in 1981.

68
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,200
In this study, Scarr and colleagues compared the personality of mothers and their children,

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,560
as well as the personalities between children.

70
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,590
For some of the mother and child pairs, the children were biologically related to the

71
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,480
mother, while others were adoptively related.

72
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,820
For the paris of children, some of the children were biologically related to the other children,

73
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,940
while others were adoptively related.

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,620
So, the pairs who were biologically related were high in genetic similarity, while those

75
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,860
who were adoptively related were low in genetic similarity.

76
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,460
And in terms of environmental similarity––it was the opposite.

77
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,000
Remember that the children in this study were adopted, so if they were biologically related

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,660
to their mother or sibling, they grew up in a different environment.

79
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,380
And if they were not biologically related, they were adopted into the family and they

80
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,040
grew up in a similar environment to their adoptive mother or sibling.

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,450
If we look at the correlation values between the pairs who were biologically related, the

82
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,340
mother and child pairs scored a correlation of 0.21, while the sibling pairs scored 0.28.

83
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,840
For those who were adoptively related, the mother and child pairs scored 0.12, and the

84
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,490
sibling pairs scored only 0.05.

85
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,090
The results from this study support the results from the twin studies, suggesting that genes

86
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,610
contribute to our personality more than the environment.
