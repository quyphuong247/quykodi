Generalised anxiety disorder or GAD, is essentially defined by excessive worrying.

1
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,820
And this is tricky because we all worry, right?

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,009
From time to time, we all worry about stuff.

3
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:23,290
This disorder sort of epitomises the difficulty with the anxiety disorders in terms of drawing

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,640
that line between what is within the broad parameters of normal anxiety and what is clinically

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880
significant anxiety.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,760
Some of the differences with generalised anxiety disorder and non-clinical worrying would be

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,700
that people who have generalised anxiety disorder may tell you that they experience their worry

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,150
as totally uncontrollable.

9
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,010
They&#39;ll say things like, “I can’t get to sleep at night because I can&#39;t turn my

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,120
mind off&quot;.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,150
Now, if you&#39;re sitting there thinking, &quot;Oh boy, I’ve felt like that in the past – maybe

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,680
I’ve got this disorder,&quot; relax; we&#39;ve probably all had times like that in our lives.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,520
For most of us though, those times don’t last for 6 months or longer, which is the

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,390
duration criterion for generalised anxiety disorder.

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,259
When it comes to GAD, People might worry about all manner of things.

16
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:16,850
They might worry about work or school performance, their own health or the health of others,

17
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,470
the impression they make on other people, or things that are happening on the other

18
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,810
side of the world - natural disasters, civil wars and so on.

19
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,180
In addition to the 6 month duration and finding it difficult to control the worry or anxiety,

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,619
in order to meet criteria for this diagnosis, a person must also experience 3 out of 6 physiological

21
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,369
symptoms associated with their anxiety or worry.

22
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,740
Some of these physiological symptoms include muscle tension and restlessness.

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,219
The distress or impairment criterion, and the exclusion criteria must also be met – as

24
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,420
with all the anxiety diagnoses.

25
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,649
Often, with generalised anxiety disorder, there also tends to be a sense of hypervigilance,

26
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:03,929
a sense that the world is a very dangerous place and that you need to be constantly on

27
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,009
the lookout for danger in order to prevent bad things from happening to you.

28
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:13,410
In terms of prevalence, generalised anxiety disorder has a 12-month prevalence rate of

29
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,281
0.9% in adolescents and 2.9% in adults, with females being twice as likely as males to

30
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,650
be diagnosed with this disorder.
