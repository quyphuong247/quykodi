00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,160
The intervention research points to several evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions

1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,230
for anxiety in older adults, including cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and

2
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,990
supportive therapy (Ayers et al. 2007).

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:27,869
In cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, the emphasis is on making explicit links between

4
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,600
how you are thinking and behaving, and how you are feeling.

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,920
So if your thoughts are negative, like “Dan didn’t stop to chat with me – he must

6
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,070
be angry with me” or if your behaviors are negative, such as not taking time for pleasant

7
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,190
activities – then your emotions will also be negative.

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,570
CBT teaches patients to pay attention to shifting negative thoughts and behaviors to shift their

9
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,809
emotions in a positive direction.

10
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,510
Relaxation training is very useful to combat anxiety at any age – it involves teaching

11
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,650
deep breathing, as well as letting go of invasive, worrying thoughts.

12
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,940
Supportive therapy is of particular use for patients in crisis and involves improving,

13
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:22,050
reinforcing, or sustaining a patient&#39;s physiological well-being or psychological self-esteem and

14
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,070
self-reliance.

15
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,580
An encouraging and supportive relationship with the patient is key in this therapeutic

16
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,600
approach.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,470
Older adults have in many international surveys expressed a distinct preference for psychotherapy

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:45,000
over medication, for example in an Australian study by Woodward and Pachana in 2009, particularly

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,220
if they have physical illnesses which require medications.

20
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,850
Avoiding polypharmacy, or multiple medications, where possible, helps decrease the chance

21
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,120
of adverse medical reactions or side effects in older people.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,610
Several psychotherapies also are effective with older adults with depression: cognitive

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:14,380
behavioral therapy again, as well as interpersonal psychotherapy, problem-solving therapy, and

24
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,780
brief psychodynamic psychotherapy (Ellison et al. 2012).

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,400
Interpersonal psychotherapy, or IPT, is a highly structured and time-limited therapy

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,400
approach that focuses on helping the patient to resolve interpersonal problems, which are

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,349
thought to underlie depression.

28
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:39,400
Problem-solving therapy, as its name suggests, is a form of CBT aimed at improving an individual&#39;s

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,400
ability to cope with stressful life experiences, and improve depressed or anxious mood.

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,030
In this approach the therapist tries to give the patient more positive coping strategies

31
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,599
to replace those which may be unhelpful or maladaptive.

32
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:03,230
The goals of brief psychodynamic therapy include increased client self-awareness and improved

33
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,159
understanding of the influence of past experiences on present behavior.

34
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,799
This is a time-limited intervention which, while focused on past experiences, is nevertheless

35
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:21,049
oriented to current goals such as better coping with anxiety or depression.

36
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,719
Other approaches that can be fruitfully combined with these empirically based psychotherapies

37
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:32,760
include increasing physical activity, mindfulness approaches, and strategies to increase social

38
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,420
interaction.

39
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,549
Also, particularly for older adults who are experiencing severe levels of depression or

40
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:46,200
anxiety, any of these therapies may be combined with medications, and this is often the most

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,709
effective intervention in such circumstances.

42
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,939
Interdisciplinary treatment models are highly effective with older persons, particularly

43
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:00,659
those with complex mental illnesses and dementia (Zeiss &amp; Gallagher-Thompson, 2003).

44
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:07,940
Many studies, in settings ranging from inpatient settings to general practice, support interdisciplinary

45
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,779
models.

46
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:16,930
Usually, interdisciplinary teams involve a physician, nurse, psychologist and other allied

47
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,280
health professionals such as occupational therapists, physical therapists, and social

48
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,620
workers.

49
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,500
Examples of health care services where interdisciplinary teams are most effective include services

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:37,000
treating complex long-standing psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, memory clinics

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,090
where the source of memory issues may be from various physical or psychiatric causes, or

52
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,040
end of life treatment in case of terminal illness.
