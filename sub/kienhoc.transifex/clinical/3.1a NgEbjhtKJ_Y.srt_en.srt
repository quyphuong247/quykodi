00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,300
Worldwide, the prevalence rate for Schizophrenia is estimated to be between 0.5 and 1%.

1
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,259
Schizophrenia is often referred to as the prototypical psychotic disorder, not only

2
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:22,779
because it is the most common of the psychotic disorders, but also because, with schizophrenia,

3
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:27,400
you tend to see disturbances in each of the 5 symptom domains.

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,540
Although it does not affect as many people as many of the other mental illnesses, schizophrenia

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,440
is arguably one of the HIGHEST IMPACT disorders.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,540
It’s a HIGH impact illness due to the effects that it has on an individual experiencing

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,440
the condition, as well as on their family members and friends.

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,580
It’s also high impact in terms of the economic cost associated with this illness.

9
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,490
Although the incidence of schizophrenia is similar between males and females, there is

10
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,280
a difference in the most likely age range for onset between males and females.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,200
In general, the onset of this illness is most common between the ages of 15 and 35 years.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,670
It’s uncommon for people to develop Schizophrenia before the age of 10 or after the age of 40.

13
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:21,549
Where onset does occur after the age of 40, this is referred to as ‘late onset’ schizophrenia.

14
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:26,340
Males tend to develop schizophrenia at the earlier end of this age range, so around 21

15
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,939
years on average.

16
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:35,369
Females tends to develop schizophrenia a bit later than males––around 27 years on average.

17
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,369
Reviews indicate that the lifetime risk for suicide in people living with schizophrenia

18
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:46,299
is a rate of around 5%. Risk factors associated with subsequent suicide

19
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:52,029
in people with schizophrenia include: being male, being younger, and having a high level

20
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,179
of education.

21
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:59,259
A family history of suicide and comorbid substance use have also been found to be associated

22
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,710
with later suicide.

23
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,329
In terms of illness-related factors, depressive symptoms and prior suicide attempts have also

24
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:12,030
been identified as important risk factors for suicide.

25
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,750
People with schizophrenia, on average, die much earlier than expected, with up to 40%

26
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:24,520
of this premature mortality able to be attributed to suicide and unnatural deaths.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,960
Schizophrenia is an illness that you see across different cultures and different socio economic

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,610
backgrounds.

29
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,360
Having said that, there is some evidence showing that lower socioeconomic status, or SES, is

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,900
a social factor associated with the incidence of Schizophrenia.

31
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,280
Finally, Schizophrenia is one of the most expensive of the mental illnesses in terms

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,390
of the amount of money this disorder costs the community.
