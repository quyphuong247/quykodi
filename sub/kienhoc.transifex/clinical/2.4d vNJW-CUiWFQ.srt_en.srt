00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,360
Medication is certainly an option, but it&#39;s not the frontline intervention.

1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,740
Some of the key strategies within a cognitive behavioural framework include psychoeducation

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,180
about anxiety; cognitive restructuring and exposure.

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,860
These strategies tend to be used in conjunction, rather than entirely separate from one another.

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,320
Psychoeducation involves educating clients about anxiety.

5
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,360
This would include talking about the fact that anxiety is normal, that it is often adaptive

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,630
or helpful, and that we understand it to consist of three separate but interrelated systems

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,320
– the cognitive, behavioural and physiological systems.

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,300
I would usually go through a cognitive-behavioural model such as the one we looked at before.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,840
I’d probably talk about some of the theories about how anxiety develops.

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,940
All of this is helpful in giving people a general idea of how anxiety works – but

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,579
then, I’d be working with the client to come up with a very personalized formulation or

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,640
way of understanding how their anxiety has developed and is being maintained.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,320
Cognitive restructuring requires that the client understand the importance of thoughts.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,450
Once this has been explained – typically using the ABC model

15
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,530
– which, by the way, is an example of psychoeducation – we would be asking

16
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,470
the client to start identifying the unhelpful thoughts that are making them anxious.

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,590
The most common way of doing this is by having clients complete a weekly thought diary.

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,130
Next, we work with our clients to help them evaluate the evidence for and against the

19
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,689
likelihood of these thoughts being accurate.

20
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,920
This is absolutely not about clinicians telling clients that their anxious thoughts are inaccurate

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,020
or incorrect – rather, it is about helping our clients to view their thoughts as theories

22
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,890
to be tested, as opposed to facts that are true.

23
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,520
So, when I am working with anxious children, we use a cognitive approach that we call the

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,530
Scientific Approach, where kids are encouraged to think of themselves as scientists, whose

25
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,550
job it is to evaluate the evidence for and against their hypotheses (or anxiety-provoking

26
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,550
thoughts).

27
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,140
The kinds of questions we teach kids to ask themselves in gathering evidence include:

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,720
“are there other ways of thinking about this situation?” and “what advice would

29
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,810
I give a friend who was in the same situation and having the same worried thoughts?”.

30
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,090
With adults, the cognitive equivalent is known as Socratic questioning.

31
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,000
The behavioural strategy of Systematic Desensitization or Exposure aims to address the avoidance

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,220
of feared stimuli that tends to go hand-in-hand with anxiety.

33
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,460
Cognitive restructuring is often – though not always – used in conjunction with exposure.

34
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,650
This strategy is based on the psychological principle of habituation and involves deliberately

35
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,840
and repeatedly placing yourself in anxiety-provoking situations that would normally be avoided.

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,880
Developed by Wolpe (1958), desensitization can be either imaginal (that is where the

37
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:12,590
client is asked to imagine a series of increasingly anxiety-provoking situations) or in-vivo (i.e.,

38
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,840
where the client actually places him or herself in increasingly anxiety-provoking situations.

39
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,380
Treatment begins with the construction of a list of situations that provoke increasing

40
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,580
amounts of anxiety – a hierarchy.

41
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,239
Typically, in the past, relaxation techniques have been taught in conjunction with the use

42
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,599
of desensitization.

43
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,709
The rationale for using relaxation techniques was two-fold.

44
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,250
To begin with, relaxation was used to reduce the anxiety response that would typically

45
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:49,090
be elicited by either the imagination or the actual experiencing of the avoided situation/stimulus.

46
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:55,660
Second, relaxation was believed to improve a client’s ability to imagine a feared situation.

47
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:02,130
Today however, relaxation techniques are far less commonly used in conjunction with desensitization.

48
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,910
Indeed, most researchers and clinicians now believe that the use of relaxation strategies

49
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,569
in this particular context constitutes a subtle form of avoidance.

50
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:18,699
The current thinking among most cognitive-behaviourally-oriented therapists is that anxious clients need to

51
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:24,180
fully experience their anxiety and realize that it is not going to harm them; and that

52
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,550
the teaching of relaxation techniques for specific use in working through an exposure

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,460
hierarchy actually hinders this process.

54
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,430
As we previously noted, the aim is to fully experience the anxiety that would normally

55
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:45,300
result in avoidance &amp; to realise that you can handle both the situation &amp; the anxiety that it provokes.

56
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,719
Each of the situations that make up the hierarchy needs to be experienced (either imaginally

57
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:57,009
or in real life) repeatedly until the fear response has been extinguished.

58
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,200
The most common behavioural response to anxiety is avoidance.

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,659
Avoidance means that the individual misses out on the opportunity to discover that he or she

60
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,780
actually can cope with that feared situation.

61
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,900
Instead, avoidance serves to strengthen and reinforce anxiety.

62
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,120
Let&#39;s have a look at the steps involved in developing an exposure hierarchy.

63
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,380
Identify the feared situation. Break the feared situation down into as many

64
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:30,349
different component parts as possible (identify variables that make a difference to how anxiety-provoking

65
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:34,469
a situation is). Then list the components as specifically as possible

66
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:40,860
and rate each from 0-100 in terms of its difficulty. Rearrange the items in order of increasing

67
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,420
difficulty. And finally, implement the hierarchy

68
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,380
Let’s look at an example exposure hierarchy for a child who is currently fearful of sleeping

69
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,780
in their own bed.

70
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,820
As you can see in this hierarchy, each step is becoming a little more difficult than the preceding

71
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,820
one.

72
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,020
The child would start on the first or bottom step and they would practice this step every

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,879
night until they felt confident to go up to the next step, and so on.

74
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,029
For example, the first step here is for the child to “Sleep on a mattress beside mum

75
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,589
&amp; dad’s bed”.

76
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,020
The next step is to “Sleep on a mattress outside mum and dad’s bedroom door”.

77
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,580
Then, have mum or dad sit with me until I fall asleep in my own bed and have a night

78
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,569
light on.

79
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,080
Have mum or dad sit with me for 10 minutes and have a night light on.

80
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,500
Sleep in my room with a night light on.

81
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,420
Sleep in my own room with the hall light on.

82
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,870
Then finally, sleep in my own room

83
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,330
with no light.

84
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,360
An exposure hierarchy is intrinsically rewarding – by the time a person gets to around about

85
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,110
the third step, they are feeling really good about what they have already achieved, and

86
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,369
beginning to think that maybe, just maybe, they can get to that top step.

87
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:55,800
However, because by definition, we are asking clients to do things that they find anxiety-provoking,

88
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,610
it is also very common – certainly when you are working with children and adolescents

89
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,280
– to link an exposure hierarchy to an external reward system, in which they can earn small

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,800
rewards for working on their hierarchy.

91
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,800
I want to end with this question.

92
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,360
What if you know someone with an undiagnosed mental health problem?

93
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,540
People are more likely to seek help from a friend or family member than from a professional.
