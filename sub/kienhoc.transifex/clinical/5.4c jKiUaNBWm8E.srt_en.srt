Animals can also play a role in making nursing homes more homelike for residents.

1
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:18,520
There are a wide range of animals that have been used as visiting companions, on site

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,020
companions, and used as part of therapeutic activities for residents.

3
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,470
For many people in aged care who may not be able to keep their own animal, interactions

4
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,410
with visiting or on site animals are very important.

5
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,400
All of these environmental enrichment principles can help with good mental health in the nursing

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,880
home.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,860
This area of psychological environments is a growing area within psychology, for all

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,120
ages, not only older adults.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,640
This is Paro the seal.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,600
Paro the seal was developed in Japan.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,120
It&#39;s an assistive device for people in nursing homes.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,210
It&#39;s meant to be cognitively stimulating and also just be fun to interact with.

13
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,540
I wish I had a Paro the seal to show you because they&#39;re super cute.

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,579
They cost about US$5,000 each.

15
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:12,110
They&#39;re very high-tech because they have all these measuring devices in them that show

16
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,700
how much the older people pat them, and otherwise interact with them.

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,140
You might ask, &quot;Why&#39;d they make a seal?&quot;

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,490
That was my first question.

19
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,190
&quot;Why—who would have a seal as a pet?

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,680
&quot; But the seal has big eyes.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,960
It&#39;s very simple.

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,020
It&#39;s all one colour.

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,369
It&#39;s not a dog or a cat, so you have to interact with it in a slightly different way.

24
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:38,070
Paro is very interactive.

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,670
If you pet it on the head, it goes, &quot;Ow, ow, ow.&quot;

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,210
If you whack it, it goes, &quot;Rrrrrr,&quot; like that, it makes a really sad noise.

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,909
It&#39;s very engaging.

28
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,680
What I liked about it is, it&#39;s not to fool older people.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,570
Sometimes people think, &quot;You&#39;re just fooling the older people with dementia into believing

30
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,689
this seal is real.&quot;

31
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:07,140
I&#39;ve seen many video clips—if you go to YouTube and search for Paro the seal, there&#39;s

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,710
tons of YouTube videos.

33
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,209
In this one retirement community, they had a bunch of Paro seals.

34
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:19,230
It was amusing, because the older Japanese women were petting Paro, and all of the older

35
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,219
Japanese men were trying to take it apart, to see how it works.

36
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:28,459
Everyone knew it was not real, but it was something different, something engaging.
