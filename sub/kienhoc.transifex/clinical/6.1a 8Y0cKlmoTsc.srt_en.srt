00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,060
There are many different tests out there that have been designed to measure people’s intelligence,

1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,010
their cognitive abilities, their personality, and so on.

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,560
How do we know whether or not we should really trust what these tests tell us?

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,150
What questions should we be asking about these tests?

4
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,009
There are often personality tests in the back of magazines, or online.

5
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,230
There are different IQ tests you can do online.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,300
All of these tests will provide you with some information at the end about your performance

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,530
on the test.

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,470
That information might even seem pretty accurate.

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,899
However, when you start asking questions such as: Is this test standardised?

10
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,440
Is it reliable?

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,309
Is it valid?

12
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,629
Is it biased?

13
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,920
It turns out that we should be cautious about what some of these tests tell us.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Many of the popular publically available tests are not standardised.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,710
They are not reliable or valid.

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,719
And sometimes, they are biased.

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,660
Even with tests that some consultants use that you might be familiar with like the Myers-Briggs,

18
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,360
which is a very popular personality test.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,290
Even some of these tests don’t do so well in terms of standardisation, reliability or

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,030
validity.

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,430
Many of the tests that are out there have been developed by business enterprises for

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,180
commercial purposes.

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,750
These tests were not developed based on what we know from the systematic research on personality

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,570
or what we know about intelligence.

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,800
So, regarding tests, the four questions that we want to ask are: Is it standardised, is

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:40,009
it reliable, whether or not it&#39;s valid, and whether or not it&#39;s biased.

27
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:41,999
Let&#39;s talk about each of these questions in turn.
