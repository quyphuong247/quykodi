00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,379
Now, we’re going to talk about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT.

1
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:15,509
Put most simply, cognitive behavioural therapy differs from behavioural therapy in its emphasis

2
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,110
on the importance of an individual’s cognitions or thoughts.

3
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,270
The key strategies involved in cognitive behavioural therapy are:

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,999
Explain the rationale for the importance of thoughts – their relationship with feelings

5
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:31,119
and behaviours; Identify unhelpful thoughts,

6
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,010
Challenge unhelpful thoughts, Cognitive restructuring – where appropriate,

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,260
replace unhelpful thoughts with more realistic thoughts,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,980
Of these strategies, the first one - “Explaining the rationale for the importance of thoughts”

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,859
– is arguably the most important.

10
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:52,570
The reason this strategy is so important is that if the rationale is not done well with

11
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,320
clients, they are unlikely to engage in any of the other strategies.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,250
The model that underpins the cognitive element of cognitive behavioural therapy is the A-B-C

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,250
model.

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,910
“A” stands for activating event, “B” stands for your beliefs or thoughts

15
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,700
about that event, and “C” stands for consequences – that

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,990
is, your emotional, physiological and behavioral consequences.

17
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,870
I’m going to work through an example exactly the same way that I would with a client.

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,890
Let’s say that the Activating event, or the thing that has happened, is that our partner

19
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,130
is 1 and a half hours late home from work.

20
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,340
They’re not usually late, and there’s been no phone call.

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,280
Now, what is one way of making sense of this event, of explaining it to yourself, or thinking

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,800
about it in your own head?

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,470
It doesn’t have to be what you would necessarily think.

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,880
It’s just one way of explaining why the partner is late home.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,020
For example, you might think to yourself that he or she may have had a busy day at work

26
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,600
– that they’ve been held up at work.

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,900
If this is what you genuinely believe, what is your emotional consequence going to be?

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,130
It’s unlikely that you will feel worried.

29
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,300
You might feel a bit annoyed.

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,810
But, you probably won’t experience any physiological consequences.

31
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,910
Would there be any behavioral consequences?

32
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,770
You might try to ring them to get in contact.

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,820
But, that’s probably about it.

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,780
Another, different way of explaining this event to yourself is that you think to yourself

35
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,189
that your partner has had a car accident on their way home from work.

36
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:21,291
If you genuinely believe that this is the reason that your partner is late, a likely

37
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,469
emotional consequence is that you will be worried.

38
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:28,920
In terms of physiological consequences, your heart rate may go up.

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,379
In terms of behavioral consequences, you might try calling your partner; you might even try

40
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,670
calling the nearest hospital.

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,010
Let’s look at a third way of making sense of this event.

42
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,680
What about if you think to yourself that your partner is cheating on you!

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,451
If you genuinely believe that the reason that your partner is late home is that they’re

44
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:49,319
cheating on you, you might feel feel angry and upset.

45
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,150
These are some likely emotional consequences.

46
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,939
Would there be any physiological consequences?

47
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,610
Your heart might start to race; you may feel short of breath or a bit shaky.

48
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,220
What about behavioral consequences – is there anything that you would do?

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,450
I’ve had people – clients and students alike – tell me a whole range of different

50
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,650
behaviours they think they might engage in.

51
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,650
For example, I’ve had people say that they’d get on Tinder and hook up with somebody else;

52
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,700
and that they’d destroy their partner’s belongings.

53
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,129
One very specific example was when a client told me that she would cut all the crotches

54
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,439
out of her husband’s expensive suit pants.

55
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,569
The point that I need to make – whether I’m explaining this ABC example to you or

56
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:33,920
to clients – is that, for one activating event “our partner is 1 and a half hours

57
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,659
late home from work”, we have easily generated three different ways of thinking about it.

58
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,459
And depending on how we think about, or make sense of the activating event, we end up with

59
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,859
different sets of emotional, physiological and behavioral consequences.

60
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,200
What this tells us is it’s not so much what happens to us in our lives that is important.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,079
From a cognitive perspective, what is critical is how we make sense of, or think about the

62
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,760
things that happen to us in our lives.

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,790
Providing a good and clear rationale about the importance of thoughts is the linchpin

64
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,060
of cognitive behavioural therapy.

65
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,989
Once we’ve done this, we ask clients to start keeping track of, or ‘catching’

66
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:19,530
the thoughts that they have when their mood is low, anxious, angry, or whatever negative

67
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,740
emotion they are feeling, so that they can identify their unhelpful thoughts.

68
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,790
Then, we teach them about cognitive restructuring.

69
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,690
Cognitive restructuring involves having people look at the evidence for and against the thoughts

70
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,950
that are causing them to feel distressed.

71
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,900
It is not about “thinking positively” per se, but rather about learning to realistically

72
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,580
evaluate the likelihood that unhelpful thoughts are accurate.
