Many cultures have stories about a mythical potion that will grant eternal life - an elixir

1
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,020
of eternal youth.

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,340
Whilst science is far from this development, we can still be pretty excited about the possibilities

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,330
that technology can provide us as we get older.

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,310
Technology is probably the biggest area that&#39;s exploding for older adults.

5
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:37,190
Many types of technology, including web-based innovations, are having a positive impact

6
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,760
on aging.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,899
These run the gamut from apps for everything from helping people with dementia stay creative

8
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:51,890
to medication tracking apps and even apps to assist with navigation on handheld devices,

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,149
such as enabling higher contrast viewing and large button navigation features on other

10
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,249
apps.

11
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:05,540
One area of technological development is helping innovate care delivered to older patients:

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,290
age-specialised health care settings.

13
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,120
This will in part encompass rethinking how health care services are organised and delivered,

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,720
with geriatric surgical centres and emergency rooms already in place.

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,990
Staff in such settings undergo specialised training, and the environment, instruments,

16
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,920
tests performed, and interventions used are all designed specifically with older adults

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,120
in mind, to translate what is known about best standards of geriatric care into practice.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:47,420
For example, this is a very high-tech emergency room in New York City at Mount Sinai.

19
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,190
It has a big skylight.

20
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,271
It has pressure-sensitive floors so that if older people fall in the emergency room, they

21
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,310
won&#39;t break any bones.

22
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,550
Usually, emergency rooms are very loud places.

23
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,620
This emergency room is really quiet.

24
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,440
You notice it&#39;s a lot less hectic.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,140
It&#39;s not like ER with George Clooney running all around, with blood and guts everywhere.

26
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,610
That&#39;s not conducive to people getting better care.

27
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,360
It&#39;s quiet and it&#39;s only for older people.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,280
Rates of readmission are low, and the success rates of procedures done in that environment

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,180
are high.

30
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,320
So there are economic and health benefits there, certainly.

31
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,200
The Netherlands has the most cutting edge nursing home facilities.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,690
But that is not their greatest innovation.

33
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,420
They have developed a whole village designed for people with dementia.

34
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,450
It&#39;s like a gated community and the whole thing is designed for older people with cognitive

35
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,020
impairments.

36
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:55,620
It has large signage, easier to follow streets, very recognisable buildings.

37
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,320
It also harks back to an earlier time period, so older people feel more familiar in that

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,520
setting.

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,820
In such a village people can have pets, they can have independence, they can go about their

40
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,180
daily life without being constrained.

41
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:17,640
In most nursing homes, people are very constrained in what they can do and where they can go.

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,820
Again, this is greatly freeing.

43
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,920
It actually helps people stay engaged.

44
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,120
It helps people stay independent for longer even if they have dementia.
