00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,260
So, what are the factors moderating the impact of stress?

1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,870
Research has suggested social support provided by members of one’s social networks helps

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,280
us to deal with stress.

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,050
Now, I don’t necessarily mean social networks from Facebook and Twitter.

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,360
This refers to actual people we see and speak to in person.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,140
People who have good social support or strong social networks tend to have better immune

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,119
functioning, too.

7
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,670
People with strong social networks are more likely to seek support if they need it, and

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,760
they’re more likely to appraise events in a positive light.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,220
So, they’re more likely to use positive appraisal rather than negative appraisal when

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,600
confronted with potentially stressful events.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,820
Optimism is another thing that moderates the effect of stress on us.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,340
People who are more optimistic tend to see potentially stressful situations in a positive

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,101
light––the glass is half full type of outlook, so for example, they might see all

14
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,660
exams as opportunities to do well.

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,800
Optimism is also associated with more effective immune functioning and more positive appraisals

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,280
of stressful events.

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,759
It’s associated with the use of constructive coping, like asking for help when you need

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,640
it, and more generally, engaging in behaviours that will deal with the stressor.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,380
Optimistic people engage in doing these constructive behaviours, because they think these behaviours

20
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:27,390
will be effective in helping them to deal with the stress.

21
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,390
They’re more likely to seek social support, and find adaptive ways to deal with stress.

22
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,109
Whereas, pessimists think there is no point in asking for help, because they think nobody

23
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:38,820
will help them.

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,990
The take home message here is this: stress lies in the eye of the beholder, reactions

25
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,320
to stress are nonspecific, and coping styles differ in their effectiveness.

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,310
Incidentally, colleagues of mine, Jason Tangen and Matt Thompson, created the UQx course,

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,310
Think101.

28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,619
Think101 is also from the UQ School of Psychology, and is taught here on campus as a part of

29
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,389
the course “The Science of Everyday Thinking”.

30
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:07,469
A couple of videos in that course describe techniques we can all use when studying for

31
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,509
something or when we need to get work done.

32
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,330
These videos can be very useful in helping you deal with stress through teaching you

33
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,830
techniques that don’t take any longer than what you’re likely already doing, but they’re

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,070
very constructive when it comes to preparing for exams or meeting milestones and deadlines.

35
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,070
Take a look at these videos.

36
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,920
Hopefully, you’ll find them useful.
