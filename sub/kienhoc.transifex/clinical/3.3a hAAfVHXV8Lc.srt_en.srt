00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,270
The media can portray people diagnosed with Schizophrenia as violent, crazy, and in need

1
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,550
of institutionalization.

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,160
As a matter of fact, violence is not in itself a symptom of Schizophrenia.

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,060
Schizophrenia is an episodic illness, with the majority of people with schizophrenia

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,800
experiencing more than one psychotic episode.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,400
There are typically three phases to a psychotic episode in schizophrenia.

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,000
To begin with, there’s a prodromal phase.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,559
Generally, this is characterised by a decline in functioning.

8
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,620
During the prodromal phase, negative symptoms such as lack of motivation, social withdrawal,

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,030
and a decline in self-care appear.

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,800
A person might stop showering, putting on deodorant, that sort of thing.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,179
They might start spending a lot more time in their bedroom, and may not be able to summon

12
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:00,949
up the motivation to join their family or friends for meals.

13
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:06,450
The prodromal phase is essentially the lead in to the active phase of the episode.

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,890
Unfortunately, the prodromal phase – at least for the very first episode of a person’s

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,860
illness – is something that usually we can only diagnose retrospectively.

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,960
The first time a person experiences a psychotic episode, it’s often unclear exactly what

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,710
is going on.

18
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,610
Sometimes this is because family and friends think that the negative symptoms that make

19
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:34,170
up the prodromal phase fall within the broad parameters of what is developmentally normal.

20
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,310
Let me tell you about a case to explain what I mean.

21
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,140
I worked with a young man who developed schizophrenia at the age of 18.

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,450
He had been brought into the emergency department of the hospital after being picked up by police

23
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,350
wandering naked and confused on the streets.

24
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,340
When I talked with his parents the next morning about what had been going on in the months

25
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,140
and weeks prior to this incident––which was the first psychotic episode he had experienced––they

26
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,480
said to me...

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,570
“Yes, you know, now that you’re asking us these questions, we’re realising that

28
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,870
he has been acting differently for the last couple of months.

29
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,500
He has withdrawn more from the family.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,970
He has been spending a lot of time in his bedroom, and his bedroom smells disgusting.

31
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,590
He’s got half-eaten sandwiches in his room that have been there for more than a week.

32
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,740
He never puts anything in the dishwasher so it just stinks in there.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,620
We’re not even sure when he last had a shower”.

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,590
“I have been worried”, mum went on to say,

35
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,542
“I guess I was just hoping that maybe he was going through a phase, and that all of

36
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:39,720
that stuff was something that lots of 18-year-old boys do.”

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,600
Sadly, that’s a really common theme you hear from parents.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:52,020
So, we typically identify the prodromal phase of a first episode retrospectively, once the

39
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,209
person has moved into the active phase of the illness.

40
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,650
The prodromal phase may last for days, weeks, or months.

41
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:07,010
Generally speaking, a shorter prodrome, or a more acute onset, is associated with a better

42
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,819
prognosis or outcome.

43
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,880
A longer, more chronic onset, or prodrome is associated with a worse prognosis.

44
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,690
In the active phase, the positive symptoms begin to appear.

45
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,920
However, each person’s symptom profile is different, with some people having a symptom

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,330
profile that is dominated by positive or negative symptoms and others having a symptom profile

47
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,080
that is more of a mixture of positive and negative symptoms..

48
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,400
Importantly, a predominance of negative symptoms compared to positive symptoms tends to be

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,970
a poor prognostic indicator.

50
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,050
The last phase of the episode is the residual phase where the person presents as significantly

51
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,400
more well compared to the active phase.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,330
The positive symptoms have typically remitted––usually with the help of medication––but some

53
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,760
negative symptoms remain.

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,830
For example, difficulty concentrating and listlessness.

55
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,230
In many ways, the residual phase is similar to the prodromal phase.
