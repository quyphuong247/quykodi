00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,100
Another behaviour that someone might engage in to cope with stress is constructive coping,

1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,610
and I think you’ll probably guess that it’s adaptive, as the name gives it away.

2
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,500
It’s the ONLY TRULY adaptive form of coping.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,610
Constructive coping is the one I would like to talk the most about, because it’s the

4
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,220
best way to try and deal with stress.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,720
Constructive coping refers to the relatively healthful efforts that people make to deal

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,210
with stressful events.

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,690
Now, although constructive is a positive approach, it doesn’t necessarily enable you to ALWAYS

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,680
overcome the stressor, but it’s going to give you the best chance of doing it.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,500
What it involves is being realistic about the thing that’s stressing you, and confronting

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,690
it head on.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:54,079
It involves being task-oriented and action-focused––so, focusing on behaviours that will directly

12
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,030
deal with the thing that’s causing you stress.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,400
So if you’re stressed by an assignment that’s due, the type of behaviours that are task-oriented

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,640
and action focused are things like: Reading all the instructions in the assignment sheet,

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,500
going to the tutorials and starting to write a draft, and speaking to your tutor if there’s

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,310
something you’re not sure about.

17
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,130
These are all task oriented and action focused behaviours.

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,920
Constructive coping also involves having a realistic appraisal of your stress levels,

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,190
and what resources you have for coping with stress.

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,840
So, if engaging in all these constructive behaviours doesn’t help, it’s important

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,720
that you actually seek help.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,380
That might mean forming a peer study group.

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,869
It might mean speaking to your lecturer or tutor in the case of an assignment.

24
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,810
It might mean going to student services and getting some study tips, or it might even

25
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,610
mean, if you’re chronically experiencing stress, seeking professional help as well.

26
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,640
This is actually a constructive way of coping with stress.

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,070
It’s about getting the resources you need to be able to deal effectively with the stress.

28
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,689
Now, this is where defensive coping can actually be functional.

29
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,200
Sometimes it’s useful to be able to inhibit those strong negative emotions.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,110
You do that via defensive coping.

31
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,480
For example, imagine you’re sitting in the exam.

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,290
You look at the first question, and realise that it’s addressing the part of the course

33
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,499
content that you hadn’t studied.

34
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:24,290
You start to feel anxious, apprehensive, and quite stressed.

35
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,659
Your emotions caused by your anxiety and stress, are not going to help you answer the question

36
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,150
in the exam.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,069
These emotions are going to interfere with your ability to answer the question.

38
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,719
Constructive coping would suggest for you to try and engage in defensive coping by pretending

39
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,799
as though you’re not being stressed by this exam.

40
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,709
Maybe you tell yourself that the exam is not that important.

41
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:46,709
It doesn’t matter.

42
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,219
Really, you’re not sitting in the exam room.

43
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,590
You’re sitting in your favorite place at the beach, or something like that.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:59,239
As a result, it’s likely that your emotions relating to anxiety and stress will reduce,

45
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,599
and you will be able to focus on the questions and try to do as well as you can.

46
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,930
The important point about constructive coping and using defensive coping as part of it,

47
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,120
is that you don’t keep on doing that forever.

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,340
Once the exams are over, you’ve got to be honest with yourself and have a realistic

49
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,639
appraisal of what your stress levels are, so that you then get the help you need, or

50
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,969
engage in the behaviours you need to, to reduce stress.

51
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,260
Defensive coping can be useful if it’s done on a short-term basis to get you through whatever

52
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,799
the stressful event is.

53
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,339
The most simple advice I can give you for how to best deal with stress in life overall

54
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:38,290
is for you to EAT HEALTHY and get ENOUGH SLEEP.

55
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,620
Because when you drink a lot of energy drinks, or bucket loads of coffee to get you through

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,549
your day, excessive amounts of these chemicals disrupt your sleep patterns and also interfere

57
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:48,239
with your ability to think carefully.

58
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,540
Unfortunately, you also don’t function very effectively if you are working or studying

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,499
longer than seven or eight hours a day.

60
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:59,840
So, what you need to do is make sure you are not overworking yourself.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,940
If you are studying, have regular study periods, not all-night binges.

62
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,150
Make sure you get regular sleep every night, and eat well so that your immune system is

63
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,269
functioning properly.

64
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,989
Getting proper rest and proper food is really important for your immune system.

65
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,660
We’ll talk more about that shortly.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,440
Pretty simple advice, but it’s very effective.
