00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:13,420
The second symptom set of schizophrenia is disorganised speech, which is another positive symptom.

1
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,320
Unlike delusions, this symptom reflects a disturbance in the form of thought as opposed

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,130
to the content of thought.

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,500
Now, you might be thinking what’s speech got to do with thought?

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,320
Actually, you only have to think about it for a moment to realise how interconnected

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,249
these two are.

6
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:34,490
Unless you have some sort of magical device, you cannot know what is going on in the mind

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,100
of the person next to us, or the mind of anybody in fact.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,340
Speech – the words that people say and the way in which they say them – is the closest

9
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,870
reflection we have of somebody’s thoughts and thought processes.

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,070
To some extent of course, a person’s behaviour is also a reflection of their thought processes.

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,420
But, speech is generally the best approximation that we have.

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,140
When somebody’s thoughts––the form and the process of them––are very disorganised

13
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,860
and disturbed, their speech is also going to be affected.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,360
Have you ever had the experience of being really tired and feeling like your thoughts

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,850
are a bit scrambled?

16
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,920
Sometimes, when I’m very tired, I might find it difficult to think of the exact word I want

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,219
to say to express myself.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,840
Let’s say I’m trying to ask one of my children to pass me the dictionary, but I

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
can’t think of the word ‘dictionary’.

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,840
Instead, I might um and ah for a bit before eventually saying something like ‘oh, you know,

21
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,740
that book that tells us what words mean’.

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,530
In this example, I’m tired, my thoughts are a bit jumbled, and my speech is reflecting

23
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,630
that.

24
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,270
This sort of thing can happen for all of us from time to time.

25
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,030
For people with schizophrenia though, their speech disturbance involves prolonged patterns

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,369
of disorganised speech that are much more extreme.

27
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,170
Now there are lots of ways in which speech can be disordered.

28
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,899
The first speech disturbance I want to explain to you is a neologism.

29
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,389
This is when a person makes up a word.

30
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:12,150
This word has no meaning in mainstream language and is often a combination of two words that

31
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,680
do have recognised meaning or a distortion of a word that has meaning.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,780
The word ‘webinar’ is one example of a neologism.

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,820
However, because this is a word that is now largely accepted in mainstream speech, by

34
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,900
definition, it ceases to be a neologism.

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,099
Another example would be if I said, “I’m going for a bike ride on the sliderope”.

36
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:43,659
“Sliderope” is a neologism made up of two words that separately have accepted and

37
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:48,470
recognized meaning, but together are meaningless.

38
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,000
The speech disturbance that I like best, just because it’s kind of exactly what it sounds

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,810
like, is word salad.

40
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,180
What do you do to a salad?

41
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,530
The last thing you do to it before you put it on the table?

42
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,190
You toss it.

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,090
Word salad is basically a bunch of words tossed together – it makes no sense, and has no

44
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,560
meaning.

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,709
If I were to say: “Dirty Mark ran wood projectile apple banana bosses baby”, that would be

46
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,590
an example of word salad.

47
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,590
It means nothing.

48
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,360
It’s a reflection of chaotic thought processes.

49
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,500
Tangentiality reflects a disturbance in a person’s associative thought patterns.

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,360
They might start off talking about one topic, and then move to another topic that has little

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,950
apparent relevance to the original topic.

52
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:42,069
Interestingly, even those people without schizophrenia may demonstrate slightly tangential speech

53
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,329
at times.

54
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,510
For example, you might be talking with a friend and planning to watch a movie together.

55
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,349
Talking about movies makes you think about the last time you saw a movie in the cinemas,

56
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,840
so you might then begin talking about the movie that you saw on that occasion.

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,609
You have moved, in the context of your conversation, to a topic that, for you, is associated with

58
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:08,950
the original topic, even though it may have little direct relevance to the original topic.

59
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,189
Generally speaking though, in this kind of example, most of us manage to return to the

60
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,220
original topic of conversation fairly quickly.

61
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,380
In addition, we know that we have digressed from the original topic.

62
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,210
In other words, we have insight into what we have done.

63
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,290
As a diagnostic symptom for schizophrenia, tangentiality is more extreme.

64
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,020
Other differences include a failure to ever return to the original topic of conversation

65
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,690
and a lack of insight into this behaviour.

66
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,120
For example, the association between the original and second topics is typically less substantial

67
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,560
– often the link for the individual might be a single word only.

68
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,840
Let’s go back to our movie example.

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,789
Imagine that you’re talking to a friend who has schizophrenia about watching the Audrey

70
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:59,080
Hepburn classic, “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”.

71
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,949
If your friend is demonstrating tangentiality, they might start talking about a girl called

72
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:06,470
Tiffany they knew in primary school.

73
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,750
This might then lead them to tell you the names of all the schools they have ever attended.

74
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,449
Before you know it, the conversation has moved a long way from the original topic and if

75
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,470
you leave it up to your friend, it’s unlikely that you will ever return to the original

76
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,000
topic.
