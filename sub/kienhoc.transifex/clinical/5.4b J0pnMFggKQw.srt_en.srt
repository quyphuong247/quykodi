You might be thinking, shouldn’t we be designing and building age-friendly cities and not just

1
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,770
these isolated, specialised facilities for older adults?

2
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,930
Well, in answer to that, the World Health Organisation has developed

3
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,280
an age-friendly cities and environments program.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,940
It is aimed at positively affecting the health and wellbeing of older adults by ensuring

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,820
that the physical and social aspects of their living environments support their needs.

6
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,950
Eight dimensions of the living environment are targeted: the built environment, transport,

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:54,230
housing, social participation, respect and social inclusion, civic participation and

8
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,879
employment, communication, and community support and health services.

9
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:05,160
To foster and share information gained by participation in the program, the WHO Global

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,690
Network of Age-Friendly Cities and Communities was established.

11
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,620
Communities in the program range from very large cities to relatively smaller cities.

12
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,140
This guide is informative for anyone wanting specific knowledge about avenues of potential

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,860
improvement to the living spaces older adults inhabit.

14
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,190
Well-designed environments can also promote healthy activities.

15
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,300
For example, well-laid-out walking paths with level surfaces, as well as access to wellness

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:44,170
facilities like pools and exercise rooms, etc., are associated with increased physical

17
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,110
activity among residents.

18
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:55,030
There is evidence that providing covered pathways and courtyard gardens increases outdoor activity.

19
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,860
Wheelchair-height gardening beds provide an activity as well as great produce!

20
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,090
One study even found that people in a nursing home walked further and faster when they listened

21
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,140
to music while walking.

22
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:13,659
The Society for the Advancement of Gerontological Environments, or SAGE, has promoted the creation

23
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:19,349
of positive and therapeutic environments for older adults, particularly in the nursing

24
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,220
home setting.

25
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:28,639
This organisation (SAGE) espouses a set of design principles that reflects a person-centered care philosophy.

26
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,670
These include expected aspects of design–like physical safety–but also include designing

27
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,159
for psychological security and well-being.

28
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,980
This includes environments that are homelike, comforting, and which are not confusing or

29
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,980
disorientating.

30
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,900
It includes both the inside as well as outside features of a facility–such as gardens.
