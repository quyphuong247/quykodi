What are the effects of stress on people’s physical health?

1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,820
In the personality topic, we talk a bit about the different measures of personality, the

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,170
different personality dimensions, and what personality is.

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,150
There’s actually a pretty crude distinction in popular psychology between Type A and Type

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,250
B people.

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,420
This is not a systematic theory of personality by any stretch.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,890
But, according to pop psychology, the Type A person tends to react in an angry or hostile

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,000
way to stressors.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,200
They’re generally quite competitive and impatient.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,649
For example, when a Type A person gets cut off in traffic, they roll the window down,

10
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:45,609
wave their arm around, and abuse the other driver.

11
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:49,649
The type B person tends to be much more relaxed and easy going.

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,500
They probably didn’t even notice they got cut off in traffic.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,609
And even if they did, they wouldn’t care anyway.

14
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,280
They’re much more easy going.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,339
Unfortunately for a Type A person, there seems to be a link between being Type A and developing

16
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:03,989
heart disease.

17
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,650
This link is likely to be due to their tendency to exhibit anger and hostility in response

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,690
to potential stressors.

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,220
This data shows that, as the average anger level goes up, the risk of a coronary event

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,250
also goes up.

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,930
We know from research that transient mental stress and the resulting emotions can tax

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,350
the heart and trigger acute symptoms of heart disease.

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,070
Möller and colleagues conducted a study where they interviewed people from emergency hospitals

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,720
about the triggers immediately preceding them experiencing a heart attack.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,670
They found that, angry responses to disagreement triggered heart attacks in people who were

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,670
susceptible.

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,850
We also know that depression is related to heart disease.

28
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,640
We know that people who are diagnosed with heart disease are at risk of depression, which

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,530
is not surprising, because being told you have heart disease can be pretty difficult

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,120
to hear.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,039
Health related behaviours, like smoking, also influence the association between depression

32
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,439
and heart disease.

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,310
If someone suffering from depression takes up smoking, then that’s going to increase

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,610
their risk of developing heart disease.

35
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,790
Depression can also lead to dysfunctioning of the individual’s autonomic nervous system.

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,370
A dysfunctioning autonomic nervous system can affect heart rate responses to external

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,960
stressors, as well as suppress the individual’s immune system.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,130
Someone with a suppressed immune system is more prone to infection from various viruses

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,690
and bacteria compared to those with a functional immune system.

40
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,390
These infections can damage the individual’s heart tissue, and lead to chronic heart disease.

41
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,940
You probably already know that our immune system is the part of our body that helps

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,850
to fight off infections from bacteria, viral agents, or other foreign substances.

43
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,110
We know that stresses like crowding, shock, lack of food and restraint, and all those

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,370
methods of inducing stress conducted by Selye, reduced the immune functioning in laboratory

45
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,370
animals.

46
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,060
Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues drew blood samples from first-year medical students one month

47
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,760
before the exam period, and then another sample on the first day of the exams.

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,500
They found that the activity of the natural killer cells in students’ blood samples

49
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,480
declined drastically from one month before the exam to the time of the exam.

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,400
Data consistent with this shows that at the time of the exams, students are more prone

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,870
to infections, because their immune system is suppressed due to the stress relating to

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,780
the exams.

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,610
Relating to my own experience as a university lecturer, if I graphed the number of medical

54
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,910
certificates I receive each week of the semester, there would be a big increase in the lead

55
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,010
up to when the assessment items are due.

56
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,650
Some of that could be due to students wanting a little bit more time to complete the assessment,

57
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,620
but some of it could be because students are more susceptible to infections and getting

58
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,560
sick during times of stress.

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,120
Therefore, it’s important that we look after ourselves, particularly during times of stress,

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,950
such as during the exam period or when we have workplace deadlines.

61
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,360
We need to ensure we get adequate sleep, and also eat well during times of stress.
