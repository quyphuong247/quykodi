00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:13,150
Would you be surprised to know that older adults are more often happier than younger

1
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,150
people?

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,260
Let’s talk about mental health in later life.

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,419
Older adults in the general population have about a 15 to 25 percent chance of having

4
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:30,190
a serious mental illness compared to a 20 percent chance in the general population.

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,020
Why does the statistic for older adults show much more variance?

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,800
This is partly because older adults are more heterogeneous, as a group.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,539
It also depends on whether or not the study included people in nursing homes.

8
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:52,070
People in nursing homes make up only around 6-7% of the population.

9
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:59,530
But 70 to 90 percent of that nursing home population have either a psychiatric condition,

10
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,350
and/or dementia - which is also considered a psychiatric condition.

11
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,700
So part of the variance in the statistic is due to whether or not the survey of mental

12
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,060
health included people in nursing homes - which would increase the number of those with mental

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,170
illness or not.

14
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,009
In general, if we were to look at data smoothed across developed

15
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:28,910
countries like the US, UK and Australia, your chance of having a diagnosable psychiatric

16
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,479
condition decreases with increasing age.

17
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,549
In this graph you can see that population based prevalence of mood disorders, anxiety

18
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:45,920
disorders, and substance use disorders is lower than that of dementia in persons over

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,710
age 65.

20
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:53,600
However, with increasing age your chance of getting dementia increases.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,840
This is why the overall lifetime chance of having a psychiatric illness is fairly constant,

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,260
at 20%.

23
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:09,160
This graph is a simplified way of highlighting the increase in impact of dementia as a psychiatric

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,710
illness later in life.

25
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:18,860
But mood and anxiety disorders are also important to address, no matter when in life they occur.

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,319
But the type of psychiatric illness one is more likely to experience also varies with

27
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,310
where you are in the life course.

28
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,660
Younger people are more likely to suffer eating disorders, for example, and older adults are

29
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,660
more likely to experience dementia.

30
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,590
However, the majority of older adults, whatever setting they live in, are neither assessed

31
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,580
nor treated for psychiatric disorders – why is this?

32
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,590
In an influential study, Helmes and Gee (2003) presented psychologists with a vignette of

33
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,940
a depressed patient.

34
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,480
Only the age of the client was manipulated.

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,930
The vignette described a white female patient, a Mrs. Watkins, describing symptoms to her

36
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,840
psychologist including tearfulness, loss of interest in activities, early morning awakening,

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,480
and weight loss.

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,440
The two versions of the vignette were identical except for the age of the prospective female

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,019
client, which was stated to be either 42 or 72 years of age.

40
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,459
An initial question asked: ‘‘What is your first impression of what Mrs. Watkins’ main

41
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,470
presenting problem might be?’’.

42
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,171
Participants were asked to diagnose the client, choose a therapeutic approach, and rate the

43
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:45,709
appropriateness of the client for therapy.

44
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,110
They were also asked to rate their own ability to develop a therapeutic relationship with

45
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,750
the client, their own perceived competence in treating the client, and their ultimate

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,709
willingness to accept the patient as their client.

47
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:08,349
Both ages of client received a correct diagnosis of depression 90% of the time.

48
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:14,780
However, compared to the “younger” client, the “older” client was described as having

49
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,630
a poorer prognosis, as being less able to develop an adequate therapeutic relationship

50
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,570
with the therapist, and ultimately as less appropriate for therapy.

51
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,880
Finally, the therapists felt less competent and less willing to accept the “older”

52
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
client.

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,280
This is essentially ageism - a form of discrimination.

54
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,690
Many old people face ageist attitudes every day.

55
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,139
There is much work to be done in building awareness of ageism in our culture - in much

56
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:53,300
the same way as we are trying to change our cultures to reduce sexism and racism.

57
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,900
This of course works both ways, as young and old people can be discriminated against.

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,280
And whilst psychology is not the only profession vulnerable to ageism - it is a huge problem

59
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,470
when ageist attitudes creep into clinical practice.

60
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:16,280
Also, all health and mental health professions lack an adequate supply of new trainees to

61
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,580
specialise in seeing older persons.

62
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,069
This represents a major crisis in the healthcare arena, globally.
