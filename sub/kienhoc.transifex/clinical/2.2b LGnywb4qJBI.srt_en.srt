Let’s have a look at when depressive disorders develop and what happens with them over time

1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,520
if people do not receive treatment.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,860
Major Depressive Disorder can begin at any age, but onset does increase significantly

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,260
with puberty.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,620
In Western nations, incidence seems to peak in the 20s although it is not uncommon for

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,480
onset to be in later life (Kessler et al., 2003).

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,720
Persistent Depressive Disorder tends to have an early and chronic onset.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,030
By definition, of course, Persistent Depressive Disorder is a chronic disorder.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,400
The course of Major Depressive Disorder on the other hand is quite variable.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,170
Some people rarely experience remission – defined as a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms,

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,399
or no more than 2 symptoms at a mild level.

11
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,160
Others however can go for a number of years without experiencing a major depressive episode.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,900
Most people, given enough time, will recover without intervention.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,579
This is referred to as spontaneous recovery.

14
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,000
For roughly 2 in 5 people with Major Depressive Disorder, spontaneous recovery will occur

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,560
within 3 months of onset; and for 4 in 5 people, this will happen within 12 months of onset

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
(Coryell et al., 1994).

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
The time course of nonchronic major depressive disorder: uniformity across episodes and samples.

Arch Gen Psychiatry 51(5): 405-410).

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
There are a number of features associated with lower rates of recovery from a major

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,159
depressive disorder – including symptom severity, personality disorders and psychotic

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,490
features.

24
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,330
Some of the factors associated with increased risk of experiencing another episode of Major

25
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,340
Depression include the severity of the preceding episode, being younger at onset, and having

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,470
experienced more prior episodes.

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,700
Thinking about Persistent Depressive Disorder, if a person experiencing this illness develops

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,920
symptoms that meet criteria for a major depressive episode, what will typically happen is that

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,501
the symptoms will return to a lower level – such that the criteria for persistent

30
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:59,799
depressive disorder but not major depressive disorder continue to be met.

31
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,979
However, in terms of symptom resolution, this is more likely to occur spontaneously with

32
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,421
major depression than it is with persistent depression.

The three-year naturalistic course of major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder and

34
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,421
double depression.
