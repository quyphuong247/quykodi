00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,130
When you see boybands and girlbands, what do you notice about these types of bands?

1
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,850
Apart from the fact that there are often five members in these types of groups, what are

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,050
the common characteristics of these bands?

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,090
Well, they have these distinct types, ARCHETYPES.

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,710
If you have a look… this is Boyzone.

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,310
This guy here is the tough one.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,990
He&#39;s got his guns out.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,100
This guy here is sort of rough and ready, with dreadies.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,280
This is the neat guy that you might take home to mum.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,550
This guy is a bit more spiritual than the others.

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,850
This is One Direction.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,640
This is quite an old photo of them.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,930
Apparently, Harry Styles has become a little bit of a bad boy since this photo was taken,

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,550
but there are quite distinct types in this group.

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,630
There’s a relaxed guy in the pull-up jumper here.

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,899
He&#39;s pretty cool.

16
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,760
This guy is a bit of a nerd.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,990
This guy&#39;s even nerdier, a bit more formal, though.

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,400
This guy obviously hangs out on the street a bit because he&#39;s got a hoodie.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,110
Then, you’ve got the Spice Girls with the five distinct types clearly spelled out in

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,110
their names.

21
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,060
You&#39;ve got Scary Spice, Sporty Spice, Baby Spice, and Posh Spice.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,960
Then, of course, because ginger is a personality type, you&#39;ve got Ginger Spice.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,780
There&#39;s five distinct types.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,520
Now, why do you think music producers create these bands with very different

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,640
people in them?

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,860
Why didn’t they just choose the most attractive people possible?

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,020
According to research, attractive people are more persuasive.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,900
So, why do you think they chose a range of heterogeneous people to make up the group?

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,920
The key is that…

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,590
They want to appeal to EVERYBODY.

31
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,090
It&#39;s the idea that there are different types of personalities.

32
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,979
People like different things in people.

33
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:47,850
So, when people put together these boybands and girlbands for commercial success, what

34
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,829
they have to do is have a mix of different people to have that wide appeal.

35
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,590
That&#39;s quite a popular conception of what a personality is, but it&#39;s not necessarily

36
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,090
what we mean when we talk about personality in Psychology.

37
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,909
Personality refers to the CHARACTER TRAITS that identify what makes a person who they

38
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:06,340
are.

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,979
Some people like new experiences, others not so much.

40
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,069
Some people are more reliable than others.

41
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,809
Some people are more outgoing when they’re in a new environment, others might be more

42
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:18,540
shy when meeting new people.

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,299
People deal with stress differently.

44
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:24,340
In stressful situations, some people seem to have more control over their emotions than

45
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,110
others.

46
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,439
Personality refers to a particular pattern of behaviour and thinking that prevails across

47
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,870
time and situations, and makes us different from other people.

48
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,949
Here, the goal is to discover the CAUSES of individual differences in behaviour from a

49
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,879
PERSONALITY perspective.

50
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,579
Whereas in Social Psychology, the focus is on the social influences on behaviour.

51
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,299
Understanding personality, and measuring it, is important in many areas in psychology,

52
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:54,040
and especially so in clinical psychology.

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,189
So, what researchers try to do is identify personality characteristics, figure out what

54
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,730
variables produce and control those characteristics.

55
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,559
To do this, they take a couple of different approaches.

56
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:09,489
The one we&#39;re going to focus on is the nomothetic approach.

57
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,790
This approach involves trying to understand personality by identifying GENERAL rules that

58
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,680
govern the behaviour of ALL individuals.

59
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,419
The idiographic approach is used when people are interested in understanding personality

60
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,650
by identifying the UNIQUE configuration of characteristics and life history within the

61
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,120
INDIVIDUAL person.

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,769
We will be talking about the GENERAL rules that relate to personality, which is the nomothetic

63
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:32,269
approach.
