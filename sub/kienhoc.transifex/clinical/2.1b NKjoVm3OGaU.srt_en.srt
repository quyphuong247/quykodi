00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,370
For Major Depressive Disorder, or MDD, the diagnostic criteria state that a person needs

1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,860
to have demonstrated 5 or more symptoms during the same 2-week period for most of the day

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,780
nearly every day;

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,710
that the person’s presentation needs to represent a significant change compared to

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,660
their previous functioning;

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,230
and that one of the 5 symptoms needs to be either persistent sad mood most of the day

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,230
and on most days––or loss of interest or pleasure.

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,340
It is worth noting, that in children and adolescents, persistent sad mood may also manifest as irritable

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,340
mood.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,170
When we talk about a loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities––we are

10
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,690
referring to what we call anhedonia.

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,860
Let me give you an example of what I mean.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,540
Imagine that you have a friend, who, before they became depressed, was a really active

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,430
person with lots of interests.

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,070
Maybe, they were really into watching &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, listening to music, playing touch

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,270
football, hanging out with friends and gaming.

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,350
These are some of the things they enjoyed doing in their spare time.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:16,100
Then, they became depressed and now they have absolutely no interest in doing any of these

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,100
things.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,250
Their friends repeatedly say things like, &quot;Mate, you need to come over.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,320
We&#39;re going to have an epic night - we&#39;re going to have a &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; tournament,

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,340
and then we’re going to watch Season 2 of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, and if we feel up to it

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,050
in the morning we&#39;ll go and have a game of touch football in the park”.

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,680
Your friend who is experiencing depression is going to say no, and they’ll be thinking

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,299
something along the lines of, &quot;No.

25
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,820
That has no interest for me.

26
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,140
No appeal.&quot;

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,780
If they were to accept the invitation, they would not enjoy it.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,700
So, this symptom is about a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that used to be

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,010
enjoyable or pleasurable.

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,040
Another symptom is a significant change in weight or appetite – in either direction,

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,190
so, either an increase or decrease.

32
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,630
In relation to weight, if there is a weight loss, it is occurring in the absence of a

33
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,840
deliberate attempt to lose weight – in other words, the person is not dieting.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,980
Whether we are talking about a weight loss or gain, we are looking at a change of more

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,810
than 5% of the person’s body weight in the space of a month.

36
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,560
If we are thinking about this symptom in relation to a growing child or adolescent, a failure

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,250
to gain expected weight could count here.

38
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,150
Another symptom is the change in sleep patterns, again, in either direction – either insomnia

39
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,230
or hypersomnia – but probably the more likely thing is that a person is going to sleep more

40
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,250
when they&#39;re depressed.

41
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,000
Partly this is because people do become very tired when they&#39;re depressed.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,120
If you have ever been very, very sad yourself, whether that’s through, perhaps, grief or

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,820
your own experience of depression, it is actually physically exhausting to be sad for a prolonged

44
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,420
period of time.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,170
The desire to sleep can also be an escape mechanism of sorts – a desire to escape

46
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,550
the symptoms of depression.

47
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,270
And so you hear people saying things like, &quot;I just wish I could be asleep the whole time

48
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,810
so that I don&#39;t have to think the thoughts I&#39;m thinking, so I don&#39;t have to feel the

49
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,440
way I feel&quot;.

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,540
Just a couple of weeks ago, a 17-year old girl told me that she felt like the song,

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,150
“Wake me when it’s all over” was the soundtrack of her life.

52
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,061
For some people, this way of thinking gets taken to its logical extreme conclusion, and

53
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:33,190
becomes suicidal thinking or ideation, &quot;I wish I didn&#39;t have to be here.

54
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,940
If only I could just be dead so I don&#39;t have to feel the way I feel.&quot;

55
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,380
Another symptom relates to psychomotor behaviour – either agitation or what’s referred

56
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,900
to as ‘retardation’.

57
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,860
When we are talking about psychomotor agitation, we are talking about someone who – for example

58
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,730
- is very fidgety and can&#39;t sit still when they&#39;re depressed.

59
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,310
With psychomotor retardation, we are looking at people&#39;s movement being really reduced

60
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,320
and slowed.

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,170
Psychomotor retardation is a very common part of a depressive presentation.

62
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,260
It&#39;s very common to hear people who are experiencing depression say things like, &quot;I just can&#39;t

63
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,940
get myself out of bed”.

64
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,030
It feels too hard to get out of bed, and people who are experiencing depression can literally

65
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:21,810
spend days in bed, getting up only to go to the bathroom and fetch food.

66
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,110
Fatigue, or loss of energy is another symptom.

67
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,710
Now, you may be thinking to yourself “surely everyone feels tired and like they have no

68
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,550
energy from time to time”.

69
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,219
And this is very true.

70
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:39,801
The DSM tells us that the symptoms must represent a significant change from the person’s previous

71
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,600
level of functioning.

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,110
In addition, one of the other DSM Criteria tells us that the symptoms of MDD must cause

73
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,479
either clinically significant distress or impairment in a person’s functioning.

74
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:59,050
This idea of distress and/or impairment in functioning is absolutely critical when it

75
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,789
comes to thinking about most of the mental illnesses.

76
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:07,080
This is because many of the symptoms of different mental illnesses––particularly the depressive

77
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,150
and anxiety disorders––are things that everyone can experience from time to time.

78
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,569
Other symptoms include recurrent thoughts of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate

79
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:23,990
guilt nearly every day, which may be delusional; and a diminished ability to think or concentrate,

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,420
or indecisiveness, nearly every day – either as reported by the person themselves or as

81
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,599
observed by others.

82
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:36,650
So, a person experiencing this symptom may appear easily distracted or demonstrate difficulties

83
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,430
with concentration.

84
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,699
The final symptom is recurrent thoughts of death, but not just a fear of dying.

85
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:50,130
This refers to recurrent suicidal thoughts or ideation without a specific plan, or a

86
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,250
suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.

87
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,669
Diagnosis requires that the 5 or more symptoms demonstrated from these criteria cause clinically

88
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,219
significant distress and /or impairment in functioning.

89
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:06,830
For example, social or occupational functioning.
