00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,340
A severe psychological effect as a result of stress is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,460
or PTSD.

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,820
Symptoms of PTSD include nightmares, flashbacks, reliving the traumatic event, loss of interest

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,860
in important activities, hypervigilance, and difficulty concentrating.

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,120
PTSD is common in people returning home from military service, and also in civilians in

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,460
war zones.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,670
PTSD is a majorly disruptive disorder.

7
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,560
PTSD is also common in people who work in emergency services.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,610
For example, people who are first responders to car accidents such as ambulance workers

9
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,610
and police officers.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,730
Those suffering from PTSD need extra support through counseling and other professional

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,370
help.

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,360
There was some concern around September 11 that the massive television coverage of the

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,690
terrorist attacks back then would produce an outbreak of PTSD around the world, because

14
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,860
people thought maybe you can be traumatised and develop PTSD through viewing media coverage

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,009
about the event.

16
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:11,780
There’s no strong evidence suggesting that adults are susceptible to PTSD via media coverage,

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,120
but young children can be.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,350
So the advice is still, when there are tragic events showing on the news, we really shouldn’t

19
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,300
let young children watch the news.

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,350
To give you a sense of the scope of PTSD, Hoge and colleagues looked at the number of

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,700
soldiers who developed PTSD after they returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan.

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:40,170
They estimated between 15.6% to 17.1% of those who returned home from Iraq and 11.2% of those

23
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,479
who returned home from Afghanistan had PTSD.

24
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,440
When you think about the large number of people who served in those war zones, that’s a

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
lot of people.

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,869
In 2007, it was estimated that approximately 300,000 former service members developed PTSD

27
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,020
after returning home from war.

28
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,010
Due to the symptoms that are associated with the condition, it can be difficult for soldiers

29
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,440
suffering from PTSD after returning home to reintegrate back into their community.

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,920
It’s an incredibly debilitating condition.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,150
Other than PTSD, problems that people sometimes experience from prolonged stress include:

32
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,920
sleep disturbances, sexual difficulties, poor academic or workplace performance, and alcohol

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,030
and drug abuse.

34
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,370
Some disorders that are triggered by chronic stress include: depression, anxiety, schizophrenia,

35
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,440
and eating disorders.

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,099
Stress can make people more susceptible to them.

37
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:43,000
Now, these are all negative effects of stress, but there are some positive effects of stress.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,340
Susan Folkman and her research team have looked at stress experienced by people whose partners

39
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,110
were diagnosed with a terminal illness.

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,500
Living and caring for a loved one who&#39;s dying is extremely traumatic for people.

41
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,610
However, Folkman found people who were able to navigate their way through the traumatic

42
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,620
period, and came out the other side and dealt with the stress, actually developed a set

43
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,620
of new skills.

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,379
They had reevaluated priorities and an enhanced self-concept.

45
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:13,720
After these people who have been through the traumatic experience of losing a loved one,

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,099
when they experienced subsequent stress, they dealt with it in a more constructive way.

47
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:24,210
They were able to respond to stress more effectively, and they were not as badly affected by day-to-day

48
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,210
stresses.

49
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,610
So, people can actually come out of stressful events with new skills and resilience, and

50
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,740
these are the positive effects of stress.
