00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,331
If you don’t know already, I am very sorry to inform you that as you grow older, you

1
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,120
will experience some changes to your body due to aging.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,340
One I can predict: you will grow more hair in your ears...this happens to virtually everyone.

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,860
It is a paradox in gerontology, which is the study of aging, that while most people want

4
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,370
to live a long time, no one particularly wants to get old.

5
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,890
These two facts – living a long life and aging – go together, though.

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,530
And so, both as scientists and citizens, we need to come to grips with issues around aging

7
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:52,280
– both healthy aging as well as disorders associated with later life.

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,829
In the scientific and medical community, an agreed upon age at which one is first considered

9
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:00,679
old is age 65.

10
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:07,620
Now, key principles from gerontology are important for understanding older people and the aging

11
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,790
process.

12
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,580
These principles allow us to be able to interpret data correctly, and understand how older adults

13
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,320
are different to people at other ages.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,760
The first principle is the idea of the difference between primary and secondary aging.

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,420
Primary aging reflects changes in the organism that are a result of the passage of chronological

16
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,420
time.

17
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,770
They pretty much happen to everyone.

18
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:44,180
Over time, many parts of our physical, psychological and social make-up will change.

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,780
For example, visual acuity declines and so most people need reading glasses to read fine

20
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,280
print after a certain age.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,130
This happens as one’s ability to focus short distances declines with age.

22
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,990
This is an example of primary aging.

23
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,880
And my advice to people in that regard is not to fight it – to get some funky reading

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,750
glasses – preferably several pairs – and make it a fashion statement.

25
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,500
But not everyone is going to suffer from macular degeneration, a particular eye disease that

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,670
has a strong genetic component.

27
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,470
Similarly, most adults experience declines in bone and muscle mass with age.

28
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,700
But a number of factors – heredity, poor diet, lack of weight-bearing exercise – can

29
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,190
mean some people experience osteoporosis – a disease where the bones thin to a dangerous

30
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,530
extent, putting people at greater risk for broken bones from falls.

31
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,350
Metabolic changes in midlife result in all women experiencing menopause.

32
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:00,020
For men more so than women, hearing loss is often a factor in later life, one which most

33
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,780
people experience by the time they are in their 80’s.

34
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:11,300
And likewise, a decreased resistance to infections is a part of normal, primary aging, due to

35
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,500
decreased production of white blood cells and general decreased efficiency of the immune

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
system.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,660
Interestingly, the immune system is one physical system that starts to decline quite early

38
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,010
– in one’s 20’s.

39
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,970
So it is a myth that physical systems do not (start to) decline until old age.

40
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,819
There are other changes: lung capacity goes down, you&#39;re less able to produce red blood

41
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,819
cells.

42
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:45,650
People’s short term memory, particularly for names, gets a bit unreliable… and everyone

43
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,230
grows more hair in their ears!

44
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:54,170
All of these changes are due to changes in the organism with time passing.

45
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,220
Why do these changes happen?

46
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:03,180
For example, in the eye, the muscles that control your lenses weaken, and just get less

47
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,209
good at the precision focusing that allows you to see things at a close distance.

48
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,120
Is there anything you can do about it?

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,690
No, not really, you can&#39;t do aerobics for your eyes or something like that—the muscles

50
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,680
change, and we must adapt.

51
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,750
You can have surgery, you can wear glasses, but you can&#39;t really do anything to prevent

52
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,510
this change.

53
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:33,560
Whereas, secondary changes that are due to aging are due to a specific disease process,

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,380
or a result of trauma, or lifestyle choices.

55
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:44,000
It&#39;s not going to happen to everybody – only those affected by that disease, or that trauma,

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,440
or who pursue that lifestyle choice.

57
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,660
Everybody is going to get more hair in their ears, but not everybody is going to get dementia.

58
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,330
In fact, only 6% of people over 65 have dementia.

59
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:05,530
So for those of you who thought dementia was inevitable with aging, you’re wrong.

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,590
Dementia is a good example of a secondary aging change.

61
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:16,120
The same is true for depression, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure – not everyone will

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,440
experience these.

63
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,030
They are symptoms or conditions that are due to an illness, and/or lifestyle choices such

64
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,620
as regular exercise or high caloric intake over time.

65
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,290
People can act to lower the risk of many illnesses.

66
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,120
The way to lower your risk for most of the illnesses I’ve mentioned, including dementia,

67
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,220
is to stay healthy, stay active, not be overweight, don&#39;t smoke.

68
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,600
Smoking doubles your risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.

69
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:55,461
People, even some health professionals, assume that things like depression are due to primary

70
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,090
aging.

71
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:05,250
If you are not clear about primary and secondary ageing, you may give or receive poor advice.

72
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,260
The doctor who says to the older person who comes in with signs of depression &quot;Well, you

73
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,550
just have to get used to that&quot; is failing to offer treatment that could improve their

74
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,620
symptoms.

75
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,240
That&#39;s why this first principle of gerontology is really important, these two ideas about

76
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,590
primary and secondary ageing.

77
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,840
All people should understand what is expected later in life and may have to be adapted to,

78
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,150
and what is possibly due to an illness or condition which can be treated or possibly

79
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,139
even prevented.
