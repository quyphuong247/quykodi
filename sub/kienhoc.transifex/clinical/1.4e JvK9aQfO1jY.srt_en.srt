00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,660
If two independent randomised control trials show different outcomes, how do we really

1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,949
know which is closer to the truth?

2
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,980
Well, this is where researchers use meta-analyses to help them.

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,240
A meta-analysis reports on all the studies––both published and unpublished––that have attempted

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,200
to answer the same question.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,949
For our purposes, the question would focus on the evaluation of a particular intervention

6
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,550
with a particular sample of participants.

7
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,809
For example, cognitive behavioural therapy with anxious children.

8
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,030
On this slide, you can see the core characteristics of a meta-analysis.

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,170
We are going to look at a particular meta-analysis to help make each of these characteristics

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,840
more clear.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,820
In this study, the authors were interested in trying to answer the question of how efficacious

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,030
transdiagnostic CBT is in the remission of child anxiety disorders.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,809
I should explain at this point that the term ‘transdiagnostic’ refers (in this context),

14
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,610
to broad or generic cognitive behavioural interventions that are used regardless of

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,990
the type of anxiety disorder with which a child presents.

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,539
In other words, a child with a Specific Phobia of dogs receives the same cognitive behavioural

17
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:20,740
intervention as a child with Social Phobia or Social Anxiety Disorder.

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,149
The authors clearly spell out the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.

19
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:30,159
In order to be included: the trial had to be a randomized controlled trial; the sample

20
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,880
had to include children and adolescents up to the age of 18; children and adolescents

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,119
had to meet criteria for at least one clinically significant anxiety disorder; the trial had

22
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:45,770
to include a non-active control, for instance, a wait list group; and post-treatment diagnostic

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,919
data had to be available.

24
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:53,131
The means by which both published and unpublished studies were found is clearly outlined, with

25
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:56,159
128 trials considered for inclusion.

26
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,249
However, only 20 trials were found to be eligible when compared against the inclusion criteria.

27
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:06,409
If we look at the point about Methodology, the inclusion criteria tell us that each study

28
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,920
included in this meta-analysis had to be an RCT in which one of the conditions involved

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,530
generic or transdiagnostic CBT and one condition involved an inactive control.

30
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,360
The trials had to have diagnostic data prior to, and immediately after treatment.

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,099
The outcomes examined in this meta-analysis included: diagnostic data (namely, whether

32
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,550
children continued to meet criteria for an anxiety diagnosis at post-treatment), withdrawal

33
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,390
from treatment, and attrition or drop out over follow-up.

34
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,140
The meta-analysis concludes that transdiagnostic CBT is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms

35
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,109
in children, with children who received this type of intervention being over 9 times more

36
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:55,209
likely to recover from their anxiety diagnosis at post-treatment compared to children who

37
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,890
received an inactive control.

38
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:03,790
Given the stringent inclusion criteria and the fact that 2099 participants were involved

39
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,709
in the 20 trials included in this meta-analysis, we can be fairly confident in the conclusions

40
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:10,209
drawn.
