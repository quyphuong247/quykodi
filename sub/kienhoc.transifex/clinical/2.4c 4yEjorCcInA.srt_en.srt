00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,660
The frontline intervention for treating anxiety disorders is cognitive behavioural therapy

1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,960
or CBT.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,200
Meta-analyses examining the efficacy of CBT across the anxiety disorders have indicated

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,040
that CBT is an efficacious treatment across diagnoses, resulting in superior outcomes

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,040
compared to waitlist control conditions and expectancy control treatments.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,420
When outcomes for specific diagnoses have been examined, outcomes for GAD have been

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,230
found to be superior to outcomes for Social Anxiety Disorder.

7
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,100
A systematic review of studies evaluating CBT in the treatment of anxiety disorders

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,059
in children and adolescents reported an average remission rate (defined as participants being

9
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:54,129
free of their primary anxiety diagnosis at post-treatment) of 56.5%.

10
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:58,789
This finding has been replicated in other review papers.

11
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:04,110
Although meta-analyses support CBT as the indicated treatment of anxiety disorders in

12
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,680
adults, adolescents and children, there is still a lot of room for improvement â€“ A significant

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,480
proportion of people are not responding to CBT in the first instance.

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,800
In addition,

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,620
of those who do respond,

16
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,600
a significant minority appear to experience a recurrence in their symptoms over time.
