00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,940
People with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder grow old as do the rest of us.

1
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,730
People with bipolar disorder experience severe highs and lows with respect to their mood,

2
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:25,500
as well as changes in sleep, thinking patterns and behavior which mirror the mood swings.

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,149
So when experiencing a highly elevated mood, for example, people with bipolar disorder

4
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:37,290
often find they need little sleep, their thoughts are racing and their behavior is erratic and

5
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,610
impulsive.

6
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,429
Psychotic disorders in later life have been less well-recognized than instances of these

7
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,440
disorders at younger ages.

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,010
Consequently, older adults with such issues did not, and to a certain extent still may

9
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,620
not, receive the support they need to maintain functionality and quality of life.

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:06,170
Importantly, both current and past diagnostic criteria for psychosis and related disorders

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,950
also remain problematic for older people.

12
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:16,750
For example, the research on whether presentations of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder differ

13
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,250
at different ages of first onset is still lacking.

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:28,120
We need more research here in light of our growing older adult population.

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,740
Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are relatively rare in later life.

16
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:40,470
With respect to the gender ratio, both bipolar and schizophrenia in older adults is experienced

17
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,880
by roughly two to three females per male affected.

18
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,030
Older adults with schizophrenia represent a relatively large proportion of those with

19
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,710
serious mental illness later in life.

20
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:01,770
With respect to schizophrenia, 75% of older patients with schizophrenia will have experienced

21
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:08,789
the onset of the disorder in early and mid-life, and 25% in later life.

22
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:16,180
Unfortunately, for both early and late-onset bipolar disorder, many patients have recurring

23
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,739
or residual symptoms.

24
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:24,159
Older bipolar patients can appear similar to older patients with schizophrenia in terms

25
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,519
of their levels of disability and functioning in the community.

26
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,349
Over the course of several decades of life, treatment is likely to lead to better, although

27
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:40,739
not necessarily normal, functioning for people with psychotic disorders.

28
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,870
People with psychoses also learn from their experiences about how to manage the illness

29
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,400
and avoid distressing relapses.

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,599
Coping strategies also appear, in some studies, to evolve and improve with age – a hopeful

31
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,670
area perhaps for future research.

32
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:05,609
However, lack of treatment of those with schizophrenia in later life increases their risk of nursing

33
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,930
home placement.

34
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,489
Given the fact that older persons with chronic mental illness may have made gains in adaptations

35
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:19,319
to life with their illness as they have become older, group psychotherapy approaches with

36
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,569
such patients may be particularly effective.

37
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:29,510
Therapy approaches often target areas of everyday functioning—medication management, social

38
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:37,529
skills, communication, organization and planning, transportation, and financial management.

39
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:43,529
In working with older adults with chronic mental illness, drawing on their past experience

40
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:48,239
of how they have come to understand their illness and what they have learned from past

41
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,419
treatment efforts, both positive and negative, is a rich resource for intervention.

42
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,670
Thus integrating their own learned coping strategies into therapeutic outreach can be

43
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,900
most beneficial.
