00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,420
You’ve all probably experienced stress before, and noticed how it makes you feel a particular

1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,420
way.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,059
This is your body’s physiological response to stress.

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,800
The initial physiological response that people typically experience in response to stress

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,249
is often called the fight or flight response.

5
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:26,059
It’s this feeling of being energised.

6
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:31,140
This energising feeling is your body’s autonomic nervous system preparing you to do one of

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,870
two things.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,590
If you can run away, that’s the flight path.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,089
That’s probably the safest way to deal with a bear or other large predator running towards

10
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:41,089
you.

11
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:44,940
However, if you’re sort of trapped or backed into a corner, then the alternative is to

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,940
fight.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,679
So, what your body does is it gets your pulse rate going to circulate blood more quickly

14
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,969
around your body.

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,589
Your blood pressure goes up.

16
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:55,079
Breathing increases.

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,260
Digestion is reduced so that blood can be diverted to the muscles.

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,520
The idea is that this is what’s supposed to give you the best chance to survive threat

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,040
from something like a predator.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,880
The problem is, in our day to day lives now, it’s very unlikely that we’re threatened

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,700
by large predators like bears and crocodiles.

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,040
Seriously, even in Australia, the land of the deadly fauna, we don’t have that many

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,360
issues with crocodiles.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,840
Or even sharks and snakes.

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,540
Most of the things that stress us are things like our jobs,

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,300
maybe exams or relationships...

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,310
all those sorts of things.

28
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,770
Those little day-to-day hassles that are not really functionally dealt with, with the fight

29
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,790
or flight response.

30
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,640
If your boss comes over and says to you that you need to complete this report by tomorrow,

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,651
it’s not that functional to punch your boss in the face, just like it’s not functional

32
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:46,200
to run out of an exam that is stressing you out.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,660
Those actions are not going to deal with the stressor, they’re just going to make it

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
worse.

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,820
Nowadays, because a lot of stressors tend to be ongoing, many people end up in a lengthy

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,100
state of chronic stress, which can result in some severe consequences.

37
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,719
In the 1950’s, Hans Selye developed the General Adaptation Syndrome or GAS as a model

38
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,860
for an organism’s response to stress.

39
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,950
From his research, Selye discovered that the organism’s reaction to stress was nonspecific,

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,710
and found that the body showed the same sort of response regardless of what the stressor

41
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,370
was.

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,780
From his findings, he proposed three predictable stages that an organism’s body goes through

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,830
when responding to stressors.

44
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,890
The initial stage is the alarm response, which is similar to the fight or flight feeling,

45
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,940
where the individual experiences the initial physiological reaction.

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
In response to the stressor, the stress response system causes the release of cortisol and

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,560
adrenaline, the two stress-related hormones that help the organism to cope with the immediate

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,900
stress.

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,700
The second stage is the resistance stage.

50
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,542
This is where the individual releases large amounts of these stress hormones over a LONG

51
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:04,030
PERIOD, and the body attempts to resist or cope with the stressor.

52
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,510
This could be an individual dealing with a difficult relationship, financial problems,

53
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,500
or difficulties at work or school.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,440
The consequence of this is that the individual’s blood pressure, or their heart rate, their muscle

55
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,620
tension are pretty well constantly elevated, and their immune system is virtually constantly

56
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
suppressed.

57
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,480
Now, the individual may be able to effectively deal with the stressor, which then minimises

58
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,730
its impact on them, and their body returns to more normal levels of arousal.

59
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,310
Even though the individual is able cope with these negative changes to their body for sometime,

60
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,550
eventually they will no longer be able to cope with these changes.

61
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,420
It’s likely then that they will enter the stage of exhaustion, which is the last stage.

62
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,700
This can result in a range of negative consequences, including disease and collapse, as the organs

63
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,320
of the body become impaired from trying to cope with the stressor over a long period

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,920
of time.
