00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,680
There is good evidence that biological and genetic factors play an important role in

1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,510
the development of depressive disorders.

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,740
Disrupted neurotransmitter functioning has been implicated – in particular, the neurotransmitters

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,900
serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,180
However, it’s a very complex area.

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,279
We know that first degree relatives – parents, children and siblings – of individuals with

6
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:35,320
Major Depressive Disorder are at increased risk for developing this disorder compared

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,720
to the general population.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,659
First degree relatives have increased odds of 2-4 times.

9
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:46,809
There is research to suggest Persistent Depressive disorder has an even heavier genetic loading

10
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:48,010
(Mondimore, et al., 2006).

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,650
So, the genetic risk is certainly very real, with heritability generally found to account

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,989
for approximately 40% of the variance in the development of Major Depressive Disorder.

13
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,299
However, this leaves a considerable amount of variance unaccounted for.

14
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,229
And there is strong evidence supporting the importance of environmental factors in the

15
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,720
development of depression too.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,140
Prejudicial childhood experiences – including trauma, abuse, and/or neglect – are risk

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,000
factors for the later development of depression.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,260
Stressful life events have also been found to be associated with the onset of major depressive

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,790
episodes.

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,220
In fact, depression is UNLIKELY to occur without stressful life events – it’s just that

21
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,730
not everyone will develop a depressive disorder in response to stressful life events.

22
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,470
So, as with most of the mental illnesses, probably, the best and most accurate way of

23
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,740
thinking about the aetiology or development of a depressive illness is in terms of a diathesis-stress

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,740
model.

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,490
In other words, a person may have an underlying predisposition, this may be a genetic, physiological

26
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,270
or a psychological vulnerability to develop depression, which is then triggered by exposure

27
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:05,039
to stressful life events for example – causing the predisposition to convert into a disorder.
