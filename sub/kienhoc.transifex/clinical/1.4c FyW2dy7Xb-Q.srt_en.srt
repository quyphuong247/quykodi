Let’s have a look at an example of a paper describing a Randomized Controlled Trial.

1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,960
This was a randomised control trial I ran with my research group here at The University

2
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:17,750
of Queensland.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,319
We were evaluating a cognitive behavioral intervention for treating children with an

4
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,689
anxiety disorder.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,449
But, we already had evidence that the intervention itself was efficacious.

6
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,369
So, our focus in this trial was on the efficacy of different delivery modalities of the intervention.

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,020
The intervention consisted of six sessions for the parents, and six sessions for the

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,300
children.

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,890
The children had to be 7 to 14 years of age, and they had to meet the criteria for at least

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,120
one clinically significant anxiety disorder.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,260
We had three conditions, and people were randomly assigned to one of these three.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,290
They first condition was the wait list control condition, where participants received no

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,510
treatment for 12 weeks, [Slide].

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,860
The second condition was the clinic-based individual therapy condition, where families

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,110
came into the clinic for the intervention on a one-on-one basis.

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,999
The third condition was the therapist-supported bibliotherapy condition, where the parents

17
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:14,619
received a brief training in the intervention and then worked through the entire 12-week

18
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,810
program at home, with regular telephone support from their therapist.

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,920
The intervention used in the two active treatment conditions was the same – the differences

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,170
were about who and how it was delivered.
