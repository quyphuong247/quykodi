1
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:14,550
BILL KIRBY: Why-- let's focus on why wouldn't it make sense for Harvard?

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,756
Are we just so slow moving?

3
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,680
STUDENT: We're still building up SEAS, right?

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,721
BILL KIRBY: We're still--

5
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:25,456


6
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:29,067
STUDENT: First, I still think that Harvard's already --

7
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:30,150
does it need to improve--?

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,334
BILL KIRBY: OK, so reputation-- we have by a longer history,

9
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:36,750
and so we have a big name already.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,460
STUDENT: From an undergraduate perspective,

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,835
I would argue that Harvard is definitely behind the ball,

12
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:41,920
in terms of innovation.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,295
The i-lab is like they're trying, but it's not-- i-lab's actually pretty bad.

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,840
BILL KIRBY: i-lab is pretty bad.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,496
OK.

16
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:51,620
He said it.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,870
STUDENT: I would argue that Duke is actually further ahead in terms of --

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,410
BILL KIRBY: OK.

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,406
So do you think we should build one?

20
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:02,200
STUDENT: I don't think we've had it yet.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,690
As you mentioned in the lecture last week,

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,106
I think it's a very important thing for Harvard undergrads

23
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:08,660
to learn Chinese in the first place.

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,220
BILL KIRBY: And there's no better place to practice it

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,493
than China, as it turns out.

26
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:16,570
STUDENT: I wanted to agree and disagree with Zac.

27
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,259
So I think Harvard does have the major presence in Beijing, with Beida.

28
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:22,675
There's a very close relationship.

29
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:25,050
BILL KIRBY: We have a very close relationship with Beida,

30
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,310
with many different universities.

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,309
STUDENT: We don't have a physical campus per se,

32
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:31,059
but I'd say we're one of the leaders in that sense.

33
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:33,850
But then from the Harvard perspective, and from Duke's perspective,

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,599
I think they're kind of betting on Kunshan

35
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,100
to be like the next Tsinghua, the next Beida, in China.

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,600
So for a Harvard to build--

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,840
BILL KIRBY: Or Kunshan's betting on Duke.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,465
STUDENT: Right.

39
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:44,120
Or vice versa.

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,990
Yeah, so from Harvard's perspective, it's

41
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,270
more of a risk like tying your name to a place that might not

42
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,902
have the reputation that it wants to be associated with.

43
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:54,860
BILL KIRBY: I think for everybody in this game,

44
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,070
there's a reputational risk if things go badly.

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,750
And we should talk about what could go badly.

46
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,120
Roman, what would you do?

47
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,437
ROLAND: I'm not really sure.

48
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:05,270
I'm not quite sure why Harvard is not trying

49
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,811
to set up any service institution, because right now the only

50
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:12,910
official organization that we have in China is the Harvard Center Shanghai.

51
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,630
And quite honestly, while that's a great way for a great alumni center,

52
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,850
I went abroad to Tsinghua last semester, and there's no official partnership.

53
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,440
There's also, I don't think, an official partnership

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,564
between Harvard and Peking University.

55
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:29,230
So I don't know why Harvard's not trying to establish something.

56
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,150
BILL KIRBY: All right.

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,610
I don't want to start a revolution here.

58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,444
A few more comments.

59
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,693
Rose-Ann and Michael, and then we're going to move on.

60
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:38,970
ROSE-ANN: I was thinking that in terms of if there was going to be a Harvard

61
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,520
partnership, I would also really imagine that it would be more connected

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,155
with more of a school that already has the same kind of establishment.

63
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:49,280
BILL KIRBY: Like a Peking University or a Tsinghua?

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,952
ROSE-ANN: Rather than an up and coming.

65
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:53,160
I think that there's definitely a reputation balance.

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,035
BILL KIRBY: So we should find somebody is old

67
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:59,830
and-- we can't quite find somebody quite as old, at least in China today.

68
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,677
OK, Michael.

69
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:02,510
MICHAEL: A former Harvard president actually

70
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,280
mentions to why Harvard wasn't building a campus in other countries

71
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,670
like Yale in Singapore, or Duke in China,

72
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,182
is frankly building real estate is-- as a form of a campus--

73
00:03:14,182 --> 00:03:15,390
is actually a waste of money.

74
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,280
And then having a relationship that Harvard has with Tsinghua or Beijing,

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,570
for example, do you just not have a physical campus,

76
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,568
or just have more programs and educational, cultural exchanges

77
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,340
are a far better use of money.

78
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,625
And then Harvard can maybe spend its extra money on things like the i-lab.

79
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:36,720
And maybe catch up to Stanford, in terms of innovation.

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
ROLAND: Harvard doesn't have that culture.

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,479
There is no official exchange between Harvard and these universities.

82
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,020
Which is something I was looking for when I was going abroad.

83
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,515
There's nothing.

84
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,639
You basically, like if you want to got to Tsinghua,

85
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,152
you have to carve your own path.

86
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:53,340
BILL KIRBY: We have a long policy-- and one can agree or disagree with it--

87
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,660
as President Washington did, against entangling alliances.

88
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,480
And so we don't have preferential policies with one

89
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,760
or another university around the world.

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,370
And it is both an area of strength, because it gives us greater flexibility

91
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,830
project by project, but you could argue it's

92
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,610
an area of comparative institutional weakness,

93
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,350
for those who want to take advantage of such arrangements.

94
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,579
And other universities have done this in a more focused way.

95
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,620
I think it's fair to say.

96
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,210
There's probably another big reason why we're not building a campus overseas.

97
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,807
Can you guess what it is, Joshua?

98
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,515
JOSHUA: There seems to be-- there is sort

99
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:34,109
of a focus on Harvard on the exclusivity of it.

100
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,400
And you have a very small number of graduates per year.

101
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,320
So building another campus pretty much doubles that output.

102
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,190
And that may not be something that Harvard's particularly keen on.

103
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,106
BILL KIRBY: So we're not interested in growing

104
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:44,862
the size of the college, that's true.

105
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:48,980
KEVIN: I would agree and say they don't build university in China

106
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,090
because-- so the Duke Kunshan University also

107
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,340
seems to be in part as well as like an attempt

108
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,010
to build a liberal arts college, Duke's attempt

109
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,260
to make its name in engineering, which is mentioned when it tries to compare

110
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,810
to Stanford, which is one of the biggest engineering schools in our time

111
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,510
right now.

112
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,470
And Harvard, if it wants to compete with that,

113
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,360
I think it should focus on building its SEAS program, which it currently

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,684
is doing in Austin right now.

115
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,600
BILL KIRBY: That's actually a very good point.

116
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,730
Not to vis-a-vis MIT, we can't compete in engineering with MIT here.

117
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,500
So yeah.

118
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,800
Very good point.

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,260
KEVIN: We're also facing logistical and political problems, legal problems

120
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,330
building that campus in Austin right now too.

121
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,020
BILL KIRBY: So If we can't even build a campus in Austin, how is it possible

122
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,750
that we can build one in Kunshan or Shanghai is what you're saying.

123
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,686
That's a depressing thought.

124
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,500
Now maybe not wrong.

125
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,400
Last comment on this.

126
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
And then I have one last question for you.

127
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,580
Eric.

128
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,750
ERIC: I think from a branding perspective,

129
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,830
I actually think that Harvard should build a university.

130
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,270
Just because you're at the top market share, and the top brand,

131
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,150
doesn't mean you should stop innovating, stop globalization,

132
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,972
but if it is to do it, it should partner with Tsinghua, Beida,

133
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:08,972
and build it in Beijing.

134
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:13,050
BILL KIRBY: With existing-- and we have all these partnerships, but indeed.

135
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,870
Indeed.

136
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,570
That's a really good, really good point.

137
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,910
But that first point, I think, is one worth thinking about.

138
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,100
So we do very well in these international rankings for now.

139
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,640
But nothing is forever.

140
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,560
If there were international rankings in 1636,

141
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,420
my guess is that we're not number one.

142
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,340
My guess is that no one actually knows we exist.

143
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,450
And so things change over time.

144
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,230
Number one-- faute de mieux, as the French say.

145
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,500
For a lack of competition.

146
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,470


147
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,170
Although remember, entrepreneurial bureaucrats, of a sort.

148
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,680
Harvard was an SOE when we were founded.

149
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,640
State Owned Enterprise.

150
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,290
People paid taxes even in Connecticut, until the founding

151
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,210
of that ridiculous place down there.

152
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,265
Even in Connecticut, people paid taxers to support Harvard.

153
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:09,770
We have as a large campus in Austin as we have in Cambridge.

154
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,950
And apart from the Business School and the stadium, what have we built?

155
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,550
Nothing.

156
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,120
And we've had it for 20 years.

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,510
Our new campus will be closer to home than further away.

158
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,300
And it's worth thinking about, and worth contemplating.

159
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,940
So what should-- now let's move into the realm of higher education-- what

160
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,020
should-- and I'll show some pictures and we'll

161
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,320
move on-- what should Duke worry about?

162
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,622
