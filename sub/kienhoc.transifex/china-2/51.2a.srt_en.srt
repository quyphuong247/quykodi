Introducing Yu Hua

1
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:08,604
On Suffering in Contemporary China

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,880
Yu Hua, it is a great pleasure,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,000
a privilege of a lifetime,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,280
to meet you in China.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,240
To meet the man who wrote those essays,

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,880
"China in Ten Words" which educated me,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
and the man who inspired,

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,360
who wrote the book and inspired the movie, "To Live"

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,920
I've never seen a better movie than “To Live"

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,760
about real people going through terrific challenges.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,920
Let me ask you this,

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
you were a dentist before you were a writer

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,520
and you learned the hard way through dentistry to confront pain.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,400
I wish you'd begin by talking about pain in China today.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:01,240
In the past, the pain Chinese people experienced

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,680
was more conformed, similar.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,840
However, now the pains Chinese people experience

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,040
are not exactly the same,

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,760
there are completely different painful experiences.

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,560
From the point of view of the government,

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,640
our officials’ point of view

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,120
recently they always heavily emphasize

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,400
the pain we suffered before and after the Opium War,

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,360
the oppression from the west we experienced,

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,040
make them feel that we have to stay stronger.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,200
It is expressed both in their diplomatic policies

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,400
and also in their domestic policies.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,080
They tell themselves they have to stay very strong.

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,760
Because of this history

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,880
in terms of the experiences of the ordinary people,

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,280
their pain has become more practical.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,520
If our pain is historical from the perspective of the government,

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,320
then from the perspective of ordinary people

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,840
our pain is that of the practicalities of daily life.

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,480
First, the price of commodities is rising,

36
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,280
and finding a doctor to treat our sicknesses is

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,400
more and more difficult.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,760
First it is difficult to get very good medical care,

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,280
secondly maybe they don't have money to see a doctor

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
and also, real estate prices have skyrocketed in China

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,720
and people cannot afford a place to live.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,480
So these are the pains of the majority of our ordinary citizens.

43
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,280
Also these two types of pain,

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
the pain of the government,

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
and also the pain in people's everyday life

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,680
are actually choices.

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
Regarding the pain of the government, as I mentioned earlier,

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,720
it is a historical pain.

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,920
They always talk about the pain we suffered

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,480
in the Opium War or how we were oppressed

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,840
but they will not talk about

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,320
the pain from the Cultural Revolution

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,880
and even more will not mention

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,120
the pain brought to us from the Tiananmen Square Incident.

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,560
These are not acknowledged.

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,280
The Cultural Revolution we can discuss

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,560
 but the Tiananmen case is definitely a taboo in China.

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,680
Thus the pain our government chooses to acknowledge

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,880
is definitely a choice

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,360
to understand, to raise up...

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,400
or more accurately, to voice their pain

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
the feeling of their pain, that is a choice

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,000
for them to speak of the pain.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,600
The pain experienced by common people is also a choice,

65
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,520
to choose to express the pain that is immediately relevant to them.

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
When I get sick,

67
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,440
I discover it is very difficult for me to find good medical care.

68
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,160
When their kids have to go to school, they realize

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,440
that it's really hard to go to a good education

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,600
that they can only go to “not very good” schools

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,120
they cannot go to good schools

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,520
they cannot get an equal education

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,680
these are very practical pains

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,400
however those pains that are suffered by other people

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,360
if they do not suffer from the same pains

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,520
they do not realize those pains

77
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,040
so their pains are also by choice.

78
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
The government - by that, I mean government officials -

79
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:13,640
they always emphasize the historical part of the pain.

80
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,280
However they always avoid the realistic part of the pain.

81
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,520
Actually they really deliberately avoid that

82
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,720
because actually they don't experience pain in their real life

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:34,240
that's why they habitually refer back to and always emphasize on history.

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,200
As for our common people, the pain they experience is the opposite

85
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,400
because their everyday life is too heavy

86
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:53,720
so in regards to the historical pains, they have no time or energy to reflect on the pains of history

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,920
they are only concerned about the pains of today.

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,240
If you were to say pain still existed in today's China

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,880
then the pain emphasized by government is a historical pain

90
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,120
and the pain suffered by common people is a type of practical pain.

91
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,520
I want to ask you about the pain

92
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,400
of the economic transformation.

93
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,560
It's a revolution,

94
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,440
we can see it all over the place in Shanghai

95
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,240
but you, you can see the suffering too.

96
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,440
Can you describe it?

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,800
The suffering, can you describe what you see

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,160
as the suffering in this market transformation of the economy?

99
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,560
The issue you brought up is quite broad

100
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,000
of course when you come to Beijing and Shanghai

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,480
and the large coastal cities

102
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,160
and even some big cities in the middle of China

103
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,920
you will feel that China really is very cosmopolitan

104
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,480
but in reality there are still very many places in China that are very undeveloped

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,240
In fact you can even say, compared to

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,640
before China's Opening up and Reform, there are no obvious differences

107
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,920
In China there are still many places that still remain the same.

108
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,080
In regard to the people who live in a place that has not really changed

109
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,880
they maybe...

110
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,400
It is difficult for me to explain their relationship (to these changes)

111
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,320
For a person who has lived a long time in a place that has not changed for a long time

112
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,840
They may already be numb to these changes.

113
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,640
A lot of people, they haven't left their hometown

114
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,160
they don't actually know the changes that are occurring

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,800
they have only seen these changes on television, so many changes

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,920
in Beijing and Shanghai and other big cities, they have seen those sort of changes on T.V.

117
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,280
They haven't experienced those changes

118
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,200
by their personal experience.

119
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,840
So they're actually pretty numb toward the changes in China.

120
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,480
For those people who live in Beijing and Shanghai

121
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,800
of course there are many, many successful people

122
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Of course there are also many, many people who were not successful,

123
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
or who wish to be successful in the future

124
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,640
and their experiences regarding society's changes are also completely different.

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,520
It's quite paradoxical that a lot of successful people actually

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,800
realize China is pretty problematic. However, those people who are

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:34,120
not successful think there is still hope in China.

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,880
Perhaps those successful in China feel that China is not so full of hope

129
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,760
while those who were not successful actually feel that there is hope, because

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,400
I think there are two reasons

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,160
those who are successful are afraid to lose their successes

132
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,240
and for people who are not successful

133
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,680
of course they feel they have nothing to lose.

134
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,920
Another reason is that those successful people

135
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,200
know a lot about China,

136
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,440
however those unsuccessful people,

137
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,800
they might not know China that well.

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
They know to little about China.

139
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,600
It's not that they don't want to know.

140
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,920
but they don't have time and energy to know

141
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,880
because their real life is so heavy and exhausting.

142
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,760
They cannot take the time to know, this is one aspect.

143
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,400
The second reason is those successful people,

144
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,280
they have more ways to get information.

145
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,640
There are a lot of unseen aspects in China,

146
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,160
China is not a country of journalistic freedom.

147
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,160
There are many things that cannot be reported

148
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,520
For the majority of the people, especially for those unsuccessful people,

149
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,840
Anything that is not on the public T.V. they don't know about.

150
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,200
However, those successful people

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
they may get access to that information

152
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,320
through unofficial sources.
