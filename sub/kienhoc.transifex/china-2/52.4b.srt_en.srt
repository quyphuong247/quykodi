00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,690


3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,070
The KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou, the reformist former justice minister

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,890
and mayor of Taipei, won the presidency in a landslide

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,670
as a so-called "New Taiwan" person.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,780
He was born on the mainland but reared in Taiwan.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,660
He sought to bridge the cultural divide between mainlanders and Taiwanese

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,150
and promised to seek a normalization of relations with the People's Republic

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,830
without unification.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,700
And over the past several years-- he's now in his second term--

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,280
there's been a rapid movement to restore the ties that were cut or not developed

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,080
during the China administration.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,150
PRC tour groups now travel on a regular and growing basis to Taiwan.

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,150
As China has grown in strength militarily, economically,

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,320
and politically in global affairs and as Taiwan's economy

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,770
has become increasingly linked to that of the mainland,

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,780
there have been predictions-- particularly

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,150
from the mainland side-- that reunification is now just a matter

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,690
of time-- that time is on China's side.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,240
The logic is very simple.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,410
Onrushing economic integration will precede and presage a political union.

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,400
Unification will be an inescapable extension

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,160
of economic and cultural ties, "as close as lips and teeth."

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,250
Perhaps, but the logic of states is seldom simple.

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,460
There are historical reasons for the political separation of the People's

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,760
Republic and Taiwan and there are still strong political interests

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,940
on both sides of the strait that will limit the prospect for unity.

28
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,850
President Ma, for example-- or any president in Taiwan--

29
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,810
must react to public opinion in an electoral democracy

30
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,180
and there is a strong consensus in Taiwan

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,560
to maintain the political status quo.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,744
