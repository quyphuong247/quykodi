00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:11,650


3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,390
We're going to talk again about the question of Chinese leadership,

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,440
the question of whether the 21st century will be "the Chinese century,"

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,020
and in the process of doing it, we'll review

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,980
much of what we've done over the course of the modern period of ChinaX,

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,119
a period that doesn't quite begin but is dominated

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,940
by the presence of this wonderful woman, your friend, the Empress Dowager Ci Xi.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,400
I mentioned that when I was dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,550
here at Harvard, I had a wonderful portrait of her painted in 1905

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,910
hanging outside my office for protection, as it were.

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,350
And she didn't like the portrait that a Dutch portraitess had drawn of her.

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,060
She said it made her look too old.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,120
So we got it to our Fogg Art Museum, and we had it

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,660
in the dean's office for a period of time.

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:09,190
She would, of course, disappear in 1908 to be replaced by little Puyi.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,430
But soon, little Puyi, who would grow up within the palace but not as emperor,

18
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,780
would be gone, as would the great Qing empire,

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,420
the last dynasty of the great imperial tradition of over 2,000 years.

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,380
And to be replaced by Sun Yat-sen as provisional President

21
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,780
of the Republic of China, and then by President Yuan

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,350
Shikai, the first President of the new Republic of China.

23
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,870
And just to remind you, back when President Yuan Shikai was president,

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,930
there were many people who believed that the 20th century would

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,470
be the Chinese century.

26
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,440
There were books written about how the 20th century would

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,740
be "the Chinese century."

28
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,720
Book titles that are familiar to you today-- China's Rise, China's Ascent,

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,740
Sun Yat-sen and the Rise of China, Yuan Che-K'ai, sa vie, son temps,

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,740
is the hero of modern China.

31
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,060
China's Ascent, An Inevitable if Unfortunate Occurrence,

32
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,479
the title of yet another book.

33
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,720
And today, as you know, we have many similar titles.

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,230
China's Rise, The Rise of China, Deng Xiaoping and the Rise of China,

35
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,170
As China Goes, So Goes the World, When China Rules the World, titles

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,790
such as this for the 21st century.

37
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,700
And let me just reiterate this most important point-- most of these books,

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,460
don't read them.

39
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,070
Save your time.

40
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,660
Read mine instead.

41
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,057
Can China Lead?

42
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,640
One of the things we know, though, if we think of Yuan Shikai,

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,650
we think of the promise of Chinese democracy that was, as Fairbanks said,

44
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,660
murdered in the crib under President Yuan's presidency.

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,260
And yet, if China did not become a democracy,

46
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,310
it did become a militarized republic.

47
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,360
Here is Peng Dehuai giving the international salute of the 1930s.

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,250
Here's Mao Zedong, also in the 1930s.

49
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,740
And here is Chiang Kai-Shek, the leader of modern China from 1927 to 1949

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,520
and then on Taiwan until his death in 1975.

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,540
Notice that they are all cut from the same cloth, all military figures.

52
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,290
And indeed, China became militarily strong and a militarized nation perhaps

53
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,710
because it had to be in order to defend itself in an uncertain world.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,810
It did not become a democracy, but it did become a great power.

55
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,240
Under Chiang Kai-Shek, a power that Japan

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,330
could not defeat in eight years of war during the Second World War.

57
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,350
And my point here is a very simple one.

58
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,400
China's rise as we think of it in the beginning of the 21st century

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,300
has been a century and more in the making

60
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,430
if you think of it in terms of military power.

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,940
The same is true if you think of the economy.

62
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,940
We think of ourselves as being in the golden age of Chinese capitalism today.

63
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,720
But it's the second golden age.

64
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,030
The first golden age in late Qing and particularly in the Republic--

65
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,210
here's Nanjing Road in Shanghai in 1909.

66
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,260
Here's Shanghai in the 1930s when Shanghai, not Hong Kong,

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,520
that comparatively pathetic colonial backwater,

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,391
not Tokyo, Shanghai was the great cultural and commercial center of East

69
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:21,890
Asia.

70
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,690
And here's Shanghai in the mid 1930s, when

71
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,520
it was brand new and extraordinary, home to China's first middle class,

72
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,620
had at least middle class aspirations.

73
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,190
This is a slide of middle class aspirations, a slide taken

74
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,520
from a wonderful book by Professor Yeh Wen-hsin of the University

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,610
of California at Berkeley who was a great historian of modern China,

76
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,150
but also of Shanghai and of Shanghai's possibilities and aspirations

77
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,830
during the Republican period.

78
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,630
Aspirations that would be, of course, cut short by the war,

79
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,580
by the Communist Revolution, but are back

80
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,260
to anyone who visits Shanghai today.

81
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,833
And I was reminded of this several years ago

82
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,041
when I went to give a speech at the 10th anniversary of the Zhongguo qiye jia

83
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:12,280
luntan, the China Entrepreneurs Forum in Yabuli in Manchuria, a very cold place.

84
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,820
To get to Yabuli, you fly to Harbin and are greeted in the winter

85
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,220
by ice sculptures such as this.

86
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,880
You get to Yabuli, and you are greeted by the most extraordinary group

87
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,110
of private entrepreneurs who gather there once a year privately

88
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,080
to share their stories and experiences as the leaders of the private sector

89
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,670
of China's economy.

90
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,710
They get foreign speakers to come on occasion.

91
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,140
In fact, I was the first foreign keynoter.

92
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,590
I was reminded of the importance of the past

93
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,470
to China's contemporary entrepreneurs when

94
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,840
Mr. Chen Dongsheng, the chairman of the Taikang Insurance Company

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,360
and president of the China Entrepreneurs Forum

96
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,470
reminded the entrepreneurs of contemporary China

97
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,740
that they stood on the shoulders of great entrepreneurs of the past.

98
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,630
He talked about a first golden age of Chinese capitalism

99
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,870
under the nationalist regime from 1927 to 1937,

100
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,110
saying that we were now in the second.

101
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,300
And he reminded people that their heritage went back further still

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,610
to entrepreneurs such as Zhang Jian, the founder of the modern Chinese textile

103
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,360
industry, whom our colleague here, Elisabeth Koll with the Harvard

104
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,815
Business School, has studied, the founder also

105
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:27,670
of modern corporate social responsibility in China.

106
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,850
And so the point here is that in business,

107
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:37,220
as in military, China's strength has been a century and more in the making.

108
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,290
And the same surely is true in education.

109
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,110
This examination compound would have last been used in 1905.

110
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,150
It's an examination compound in which people would come and spend

111
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,030
at least three days studying for the imperial examination.

112
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,210
You would come into this compound, walk down the central corridor,

113
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,430
go into one of those cubicles, and you would

114
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,190
bring your own food, your own water, and your own waste bucket.

115
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,119
And the only way to get out of the compound was to die.

116
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,910
And if you died, they didn't open the gate.

117
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,270
They just threw you over the wall.

118
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,670
So when I hear students today complain about gaokao or GREs,

119
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,640
I tell them, give me a break.

120
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,580
You have no idea what your ancestors put up with.

121
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,730
However, this system would be gone in 1905

122
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,860
and replaced by an international system of colleges and universities,

123
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,230
one of the most dynamic systems of higher education in the world.

124
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,990
Small, but dynamic, of public and private Chinese

125
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,940
and foreign institutions, places like this,

126
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,430
which is now part of Dongnan University, Southeast University in Nanjing.

127
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,360
A gymnasium in which John Dewey and Bertrand

128
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,660
Russell gave an extraordinary set of lectures in 1920.

129
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,190
Or Yanjing University, founded in the late 1920s.

130
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,910
Now, the campus of Peking University, of Beijing University-- this

131
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,220
is its founding moments in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

132
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,020
You can see the continuity between the history architecturally of Yanjing

133
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,580
University and of Peking University.

134
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,320
And a point to be made here is that the architectural and intellectual

135
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,720
foundations of every major Chinese university

136
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,070
have there roots in the Republican period.

137
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,520
Jinling Women's College, now the campus of Nanjing University, National Central

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,070
University, built in 1930 and modeled on the greatest university

139
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,550
in the world in 1930, which was, of course, not Harvard,

140
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,982
but the University of Berlin.

141
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:33,190
And you know it's modeled on the University of Berlin

142
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,799
because there's a little Brandenburg Gate welcoming you

143
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,840
into the campus of what had been National Central University.

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,100
You can get a sense of the architectural and intellectual continuities

145
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,850
and discontinuities of modern China in particular

146
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,370
by looking at the history of Tsinghua University.

147
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,570
Tsinghua, you will remember, the Tsinghua Yuan,

148
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,400
dating from the Qing period, the gate built in 1911 to welcome one

149
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,510
into Tsinghua Xuetang, the Tsinghua College or Tsinghua Academy

150
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,310
in the last year of the last dynasty of imperial China.

151
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,220
Then, Tsinghua becomes an American style institution

152
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,010
modeled in part on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

153
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,330
And here, it almost looks like you're in the Midwest, a campus that

154
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,900
would then be transformed and Sovietized in the 1950s.

155
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,215
Tsinghua University as Moscow State architecturally and, as we know,

156
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:33,500
being transformed again in very contemporary times.

157
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,840
So the point here is that in education, as in entrepreneurship,

158
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,210
as in military power, China's strength is not just of the last 20 or 30 years.

159
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,730
It's a century and more in the making.

160
00:09:47,730 --> 00:10:03,840
