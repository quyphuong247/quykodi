00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:12,170


2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:18,320
I'm here with Ezra Vogel, the Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,610
Emeritus here at Harvard, former Director of the Fairbank Center

4
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,370
here at Harvard, and of the Harvard University Asia

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,740
Center, the author of many very influential books on East Asia,

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:37,290
on China, and on Japan, and the author most recently of the bestselling book

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,090
Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China,

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,540
a book that has done extraordinarily well in this country

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,980
and around the world in English, but in Chinese translation,

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,930
has more than a half a million.

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,020
650,000 is the latest I've heard.

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,240
650,000 and counting sales.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,819
We want to talk about Deng Xiaoping as a transformative figure of modern China.

14
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,300
And I thought I would start, Ezra, by asking you--

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,760
most of our viewers will think of Deng in terms of his accomplishments

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,520
in the period after 1978, China's opening up and reform.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,110
But he had a long career before then.

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,820
He was one of the founding members of the People's Republic, senior official

19
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,360
in the first decade of the People's Republic.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,620
What can you tell us about his background and his accomplishments

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,710
and challenges in the formative decade, the 1950s?

22
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,290
He had an extraordinarily rich background.

23
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,680
He was born in 1904, spent five years in France in the '20s.

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,310
He spent one year in the Soviet Union, '26-'27.

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,790
He had been 12 years in the army.

26
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,540
He had done local government.

27
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,900
He had fought as a guerrilla fighter.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,280
He was a front commander for 500,000 troops in then,

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,900
perhaps the most decisive battle of the country.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,300
And so he had, coming into 1952, when he went

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,449
to Beijing, an extraordinary background.

32
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,270
He had just finished three years in charge of one

33
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,840
of the six big administrative regions in the southwest, where he came from.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,430
So he'd had local experience in directing land reform,

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,070
and carrying out the initial establishment of power.

36
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,010
So when he came to Beijing, he was a leader already in the government.

37
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,070
And after 1956, the Eighth Party Congress,

38
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:39,514
he was beginning to think of developing a basis for modernization.

39
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:42,980
We think of 1978 as the crucial year.

40
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,810
But in fact, the Eighth Party Congress, in 1956,

41
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,770
already displayed a vision of trying to modernize China.

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,965
They were building a 12 year scientific plan.

43
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:57,110
They had an economic plan.

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,300
The Soviet Union was helping introduce all kinds of factories.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,050
And they were on the way to beginning modernization.

46
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,950
And he led that process.

47
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,880
But Deng was one who knew that you needed a leader.

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,260
And he believed that the job of people down below was to listen to the leader

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,040
and carry out.

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,530
You needed discipline.

51
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,560
And Mao was in charge.

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,930
And if Mao wanted something, he would do it.

53
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,020
In 1957, he destroyed a lot of lives of intellectuals

54
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,080
in the campaign known as the Anti-Rightist Campaign.

55
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,340
Over 550,000 people were attacked.

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,740
He was honest later in admitting that he had been responsible,

57
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,050
also, for the Great Leap Forward in some of those eras.

58
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,170
But in about 1961, '62, he began to depart from Mao.

59
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,800
Mao wanted to continue pushing revolution, class struggle.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,110
Deng was said by Mao to be sitting in the background,

61
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,610
not listening to his speech.

62
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,410
They knew that if he was up close, he would have to do what Mao said.

63
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,070
But if he sat a little distance, he would

64
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,100
be able to have little degree of freedom,

65
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,010
didn't report to Mao anymore than he had to

66
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,740
so he could begin to take realistic steps.

67
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,060
He was on the front line.

68
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,940
Mao was the philosopher, the theorist behind.

69
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,180
And Deng was a man who was on target in terms

70
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,270
of implementing all those campaigns and making them work.

71
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:39,851
