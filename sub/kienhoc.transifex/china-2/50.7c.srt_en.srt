00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,182


3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:10,640
BILL KIRBY: There are lots of challenges we could get into.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,931
One of them is the desertification of North China, the diverting of waters

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,430
from--

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,340
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: From the south to the north.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,430
BILL KIRBY: --the south to the north.

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,638
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: The thing that is actually scary,

9
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:24,020
if I were a Chinese policy leader I would really worry about,

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,235
is I have to make plans for water resources

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,490
that are based on my historical information of what the water

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,490
resources were.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,000
So maybe I've got 50 or 100 years of data that I can use.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,730
But the world is changing, climatically changing.

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,800
There's no question it is changing in a major, major way.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,340
So how do I actually plan for the future?

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,900
I mean, am I going to bet enormous amounts of investment

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,210
on something that would turn out to be insufficient, or even worse,

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,256
disastrous?

20
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,630
So it's a really serious problem.

21
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,430
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: So we work very intensively on air quality,

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,030
and we have for a very long time.

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,482
The atmospheric model, we actually operate an atmospheric station with

24
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:05,750
our partners at Tsinghua University, very strong data and a really strong

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:12,750
atmospheric group, which might - I think one thing that is actually

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,110
misunderstood about China's air quality problems by the public,

27
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,640
and even by leaders, and by the media is that these problems,

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,250
these air quality problems, in particular the PM(2.5)--

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,990
the fine particle pollution of which there's been really serious episodes

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,340
in recent years in wintertime in northern cities--

31
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,640
are much more complex scientifically than I think people recognize.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,750
PM(2.5) is not a pollutant.

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,500
People tend to think of it-- it's a pollutant.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,310
If there's terrible PM(2.5), then you have to turn off the sources

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,410
of PM(2.5).

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,920
But actually, PM(2.5) is a category of pollutants.

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,990
There are many different kinds of PM(2.5),

38
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,430
and it can form chemically in the air from precursor gases and a whole

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,782
variety of precursor gases.

40
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:02,240
BILL KIRBY: What's a precursor gas?

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: Well, like sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen oxide.

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,889
Sulfur dioxide comes mainly from burning coal, particularly in power plants,

43
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,610
and so forth.

44
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,400
It's a pollutant that then reacts in the atmosphere with other species

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,480
to form fine particles.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,830
And so it's a very, very complex set of mechanisms that causes PM(2.5).

47
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,020
And so the solutions are also very complex.

48
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,279
They're very challenging.

49
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,945
What I think people don't understand, and we're always stressing

50
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:41,840
in our program, is that the science to inform the decision making

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,320
on the control of PM(2.5) is not as advanced as people tend to think.

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,180
China has very advanced sort of environmental engineering capabilities,

53
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,470
but in atmospheric chemistry, for instance, it's a very small community.

54
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,630
It's getting established, but the knowledge base

55
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,160
to inform the decision making is not as advanced as people think.

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,360
This is one of reasons why our program exists.

57
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,220
We partner.

58
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,520
We're bringing the much richer experience of Western countries

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,230
in atmospheric transport and chemistry developed

60
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,650
over many years of responding to the problems in the US

61
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,740
to China in partnership with our colleagues

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,150
and in fact sending people who were trained at Harvard to China to help

63
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,760
establish that atmospheric chemistry community in China.

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,450
So getting back to Mike's point, talking about how climate change-- you

65
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,580
make decisions based on what we know and how climate change actually

66
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,700
could be shifting the ground in ways that we

67
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,110
don't have a lot of strong empirical basis to decide for the future.

68
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,450
This is also true for the air quality problem.

69
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,842
There's a real open question, and it's an open scientific question.

70
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm not asserting this.

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,590
I'm saying it's an open scientific question whether or not

72
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,040
changes in meteorology from climate change

73
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,450
may be a cause, one of the contributing causes,

74
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,040
of these fine particle pollution episodes.

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,060
For instance, if the winds are slowing down over time,

76
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,079
you're having more stagnant air, and it allows the fine particle pollution

77
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,200
to build up more than it had in the past,

78
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,370
and it could be a factor in these episodes.

79
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,540
It very well could be a factor in these episodes.

80
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,585
BILL KIRBY: I thought you were going to say just the opposite,

81
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:31,180
that if the winds increase over time and you have more dust from inner Mongolia

82
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,140
and so on that you have a natural cause, historically natural cause

83
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,794
you can read about this centuries ago of pollutants in North China.

84
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:40,210
But that's not what you're saying.

85
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,084
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: I'm not talking about dust.

86
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:49,310
I'm talking about anthropogenic industrially derived air pollution.

87
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,196
I don't want to get into the gory science.

88
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:54,570
Actually, Mike would be better to talk about this anyway.

89
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,250
But there is evidence of shifting meteorological conditions in China,

90
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,160
also potentially more humidity in winter time, that

91
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,820
could be contributing to these fine particle pollution episodes.

92
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,050
So the takeaway point for people analyzing this

93
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,750
as an outside observer who are not experts

94
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:22,360
is that you can't simply see the existence of these terrible pollution

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,437
problems and assume therefore there has been policy failure to solve them.

96
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:28,270
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: A simple version of what

97
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,750
happens if you have this pollution.

98
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,480
Suppose that exists.

99
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,190
So you have a polluted day.

100
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,320
First thing that happens is the absorption of sunlight

101
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,910
in the top of the pollution layer warms the atmosphere.

102
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,250
If the atmosphere is warmer here than it was before,

103
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,030
the atmosphere becomes very stable.

104
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,637
So essentially, the air doesn't move vertically.

105
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,220
So you don't clean out the atmosphere.

106
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,730
So you keep putting more stuff into a stagnant layer.

107
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,930
Now, historically, some of the big problems

108
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,330
that we've had in the west with our air pollution--

109
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,430
the one that people talk about is the disaster

110
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,240
that occurred in London in 1951 where people died in the street.

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,070
That was caused by a similar phenomenon.

112
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,750
It was caused in that particular case by coal-fired heating

113
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,490
systems in individual houses.

114
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,980
Soot going into the air.

115
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,110
Normally the wind would blow it away, but for over a week,

116
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,200
it became stagnant, and the stuff kept accumulating,

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,920
and people dropped dead in the streets.

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,510
And in Donora, Pennsylvania in the US a few years earlier

119
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,790
was a similar episode.

120
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,080
So the feedback effects are really what makes its very complicated.

121
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,470
And to add to what Chris said, understanding

122
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,390
exactly what is going to happen from particular chemicals

123
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,790
that you release in the system requires a level

124
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,640
of understanding of the chemistry that's actually pretty demanding.

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,260
So let me tell you the story about Los Angeles smog.

126
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,540
Los Angeles smog was something that people began to recognize as an issue

127
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,750
only in the late 1950s, early 1960s.

128
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,427
It was sunny, it was clean, and people were getting sick--

129
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:20,552
BILL KIRBY: That's why the Dodgers moved out there.

130
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,200
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: Yeah, exactly.

131
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,530
So what was going on?

132
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,230
So Haagen-Smit, who was a famous engineer at Caltech,

133
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,100
said, I think maybe the automobile is responsible for this stuff.

134
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,440
So he brought his car into Caltech, and he hooked up the exhaust to his lab,

135
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,120
he simulated what happened with sunlight,

136
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,296
and he found out that they were making ozone.

137
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,275
And he said, ozone is made by automobiles.

138
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:46,990


139
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,690
So then the question is, how exactly do the automobiles make ozone?

140
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,990
It's not coming out of the tail pipe of the car.

141
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,031
It's a combination-- and finally you understand--

142
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:57,820
of oxides, of nitrogen, and hydrocarbons, and sunlight

143
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,310
that make ozone.

144
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,740
But depending on what mix of hydrocarbons, and oxides,

145
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,170
and hydrogen you have, you could either destroy ozone or make more.

146
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,320
And so it's a famous case where Ronald Reagan said,

147
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,750
when he was defending his attack on the Redwood trees,

148
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,450
he says trees cause pollution.

149
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,660
We don't have to worry about it, trees cause pollution.

150
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,297
Well, Ronald Regan was partially right.

151
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:23,380
It was trees that cause pollution with automobiles

152
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,060
that provide the oxides and nitrogen.

153
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,640
So the relevance to the China story is that if you

154
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,090
have to actually have to deal with oxides and nitrogen, sulfur

155
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:37,770
oxides, ammonia, particulates, and high levels of humidity,

156
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,120
you need to have a really detailed understanding of what's going on.

157
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,170
If you pick the wrong control, you actually make the problem worse.

158
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,380
So it's not easy to do this.

159
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,864
