[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,230


3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,640
The disasters of Mao's Zedong's rule on the mainland led,

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,480
as we know, his successor Deng Xiaoping to begin an era of opening and reform

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,800
on the People's Republic that had many similarities to Taiwan's model

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,620
of development of the 1960s and '70s.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,010
After Deng's return to power in 1978, the Chinese Communist Party

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,510
maintained absolute political control, as the Guomindang had on Taiwan,

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,550
but it permitted an ever widening range of economic activity.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,770
A new land reform took place as agricultural communes were dismantled.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,800
Land was returned to farming families.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,690
Entrepreneurship was encouraged with the legalization, or at least toleration,

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,090
of multiple forms of private enterprise.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,000
State-owned enterprises were increasingly corporatized

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,690
and foreign investment and expertise was sought.

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,879
As in the case of Taiwan and the other Asian Tigers,

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,770
economic development was guided by an increasingly strong technocracy.

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,930
China entered a stage of export-led growth

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,270
that would dwarf anything that had come before.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,740
Chinese capitalism-- which under Mao Zedong

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,460
had been forced underground or overseas, not the least to Hong Kong

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,930
and to Taiwan-- began again to flourish and to return.

23
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,420
Under martial law, the ROC and Taiwan had restricted connections

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,990
across the Taiwan Strait.

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,000
For 40 years, there were no direct postal, telephone, or transport links.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,650
A small amount of trade took place through third parties.

27
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,882
Even books printed on the mainland were banned from public circulation.

28
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,590
With the lifting of martial law, however,

29
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,760
came a set of powerful, if still indirect, links--

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,570
often via Hong Kong-- that permitted a great expansion

31
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:05,840
in the movement of goods, people, and investment across the Strait.

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,960
According to Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, cross-Strait trade in 1986

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,416
was less than $1 billion.

34
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:18,120
By 2007, it was more than $100 billion.

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,700
Today, it is over $200 billion.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,580
From 1984 to 2007, the share of cross-Strait trade

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,050
in Taiwan's total foreign trade grew from 1% to 22%

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,550
and the mainland is now the largest export and import market for Taiwan.

39
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,010
Taiwan businessmen invested, in this period, hundreds of billions

40
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,850
of dollars in more than 100,000 projects centered in Guangdong, Fujian,

41
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,000
Yangtze River Delta, and other areas.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,280
With investment came the movement of human capital

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,880
and the flourishing of cultural context.

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,580
More than 1 million ROC citizens now reside on the mainland

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,730
with perhaps as many as 500,000 in the greater Shanghai area alone.

46
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,980
There have been more than 300,000 cross-Strait marriages.

47
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,939
5 million Taiwanese visitors visited the mainland in the year 2007 alone,

48
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,730
bringing the total number of tourist visits

49
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,150
since the end of martial law in that year to more than 50 million.

50
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,050
Another measure of contact, I suppose, can

51
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,400
be seen in the form of telephone calls.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,650
In 1989, there were only 730,000 phone calls between Taiwan

53
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,210
and the mainland-- about 2,000 calls a day.

54
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:45,600
By 2006, this number had increased 480 times,

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,360
reaching 350 million annual calls-- a million calls a day.

56
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,560
The flow of venture and human capital from Taiwan to the mainland

57
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,420
gathered momentum even though the governments of Li Denghui and Chen

58
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,500
Shuibian sought to regulate and limit the scope of Taiwan's investment

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,470
on the mainland.

60
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,960
And indeed, even during Chen Shuibian's presidency,

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,780
the public pressure in Taiwan to open up direct transportation across the Strait

62
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,570
resulted an agreement between Taiwan and the mainland in June, 2006

63
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,780
to implement cross-Strait charter flights,

64
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,540
as they were called, for cargo, for holidays, and emergencies.

65
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,980
These flights are now daily and between some cities, hourly;

66
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,740
and they are regularly scheduled for the first time since 1949 thanks

67
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,640
to the rapid improvement in cross-Strait relations that began in 2008.

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:48,235
