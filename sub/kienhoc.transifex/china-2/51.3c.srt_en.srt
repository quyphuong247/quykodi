On Humor And Compassion

1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,240
I really think what distinguishes Mo Yan from his predecessors

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,160
in Chinese nativist tradition

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,520
is that he is able to look at the dark side of the countryside

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,280
with two very unusual approaches or attitudes

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,880
for me, one perhaps can be described as a sense of humor

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,240
this kind of exuberant sense with which

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,280
to laugh at things which otherwise would have been regarded

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,600
as miserable or even unbearable

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,360
but on the other hand, Mr. Mo Yan is also able to embrace

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,440
different kinds of circumstances of the rural life

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,880
with a sense of compassion and even mercy

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,640
So from the point of view of humor and compassion

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,240
how do you see your works and your own interpretation of the "native-soil" literature style in your works?

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,640
First of all, I feel that

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,840
the path blazed by Lu Xun of "native-soil" literature and realism started by Lu Xun

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,080
was actually broken after 1949 and the creation of the New China

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,720
The red classics that authors were writing at the time

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,760
were really a combination of revolutionary realism and romanticism.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,440
They came out from that tradition.

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:31,560
In the 80s when we started writing, I feel we really tried to continue down the path started by Lu Xun.

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,400
So I think that our writings contain Lu Xun's spirit and blood flowing through them.

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,280
Of course, we wouldn't dare say we superseded Lu Xun,

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,680
but we were definitely continuing his style of work,

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,760
and even developing it.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,520
This is for sure, right.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
And a lot of things that Lu Xun did not write about we wrote about.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,840
In Lu Xun's writings I believe there is the extremely unpopular realist criticism and opinions—

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,360
they also had the spirit of humor—

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,760
—including his "Story of Ah Q."

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,440
right.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,520
That also has a certain sense of humor that lets a person feel—A shocking kind of humor.

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,240
As for the descriptions of humor in my works, I think it comes from life,

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,480
and is not something that I invented, created.

34
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,160
Because I grew up in the environment of the countryside

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,480
when we were in the middle of living our lives we didn't really realize that our circumstances were so difficult.

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,280
right.

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
We thought this was a kind of normalcy.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
 It was the same for everyone.

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,680
So much that we even thought our lives were better than the lives of people in America

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Our lives were better than those in Taiwan.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,080
Our lives were blessed,

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,640
while it was the people in America and Taiwan, in the western capitalist countries,

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,600
that were living in midst of deep waters and burning flames.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,400
So as a child growing up in this kind of environment,  I think I still encountered a lot of happiness.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,920
For example, when a movie is suddenly released.

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,560
Of course they only played once or twice a year, but when one comes out we were very happy to watch.

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,920
Or suddenly discovering two dogs fighting in the street.

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,040
That also made us really happy. Right.

49
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,200
That is to say the happiness in our lives life really did exist here and there.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,080
Even if now looking back on this kind of happiness, it's such a pitiable happiness.

51
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,680
Humor, I think, for the common people, especially the people living in difficult circumstances.

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
a sort of wisdom, a means to survival.

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,160
It is also a way (to survive).

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:29,040
So I think no matter how terrible the external circumstances or how poor the material life,

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,280
there is often still a sort of humor that exists.

56
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,160
For example workers on a construction,

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
in the bitter cold,

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,560
laboriously laboring, without ever eating a full meal—

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
someone will suddenly say something and everyone will start laughing uproariously.

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,600
Of course, this kind of humor, when we now think of it, it really makes you sympathetic.

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,720
Yet at the time we didn't think it was anything, anything to be pitied.

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,560
So I think my humor comes from life, the absurdity also comes from life.

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,120
It's the same as humor.

64
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,200
We were living in an absurd life, we didn't realize it at the time.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,040
 Only after some years have past, only after society has established normal life,

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,760
we compare and think, "ah, how absurd it was back then!"

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,880
right, right, right.

68
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,600
So these kinds of descriptions really are a kind of realist description.

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,600
So earlier when I said that we draw on the realist tradition of Lu Xun, this is what I meant.

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,520
"But the part about compassion, especially in works like  'Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out,'

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,560
which use allusions from Buddhist sutras—

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,840
these are extremely compassionate.

73
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,840
As for this part, is it the case that you think there is something different between this

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,880
and the critical realism or revolutionary realism of the past?

75
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
"This is definitely something different from the traditions you just mentioned.

76
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,520
It's also different from my early works.

77
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,440
I also think my own works have developed since 'Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out.'

78
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,600
They've reached a new phase after Life and Death are Wearing Me Out.

79
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,680
In my writings of the past, evil—evil people, evil power,  evil phenomena—to be critical

80
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,640
sorely lacked finesse

81
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,520
When I would create so-called "bad guys" I would make them really bad, so that they were devoid of any merit.

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,360
It was a kind of absolutist concept.

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,080
It is also going from one extreme to another extreme.

84
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,640
in the past we would create "good guys" and make them  perfect with no flaws.

85
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,680
Now we take the people we loathe

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
the people we abhor, we write them devoid of any merit.

87
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,640
In reality this is not objective.

88
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,680
When it came to writing Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out,  the title itself comes straight from a Buddhist sutra

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,680
a dialogue in the "Eight Great Awakenings Sutra,"

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,640
 and I also took Buddhism as a kind of backdrop.

91
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,240
Looking at humanity from the perspective of Buddhist theory,

92
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,880
it really is very pitiable

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,320
Whether a "good" person or a "bad" person in reality —we are all living in a single path.

94
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,800
The human path.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,520
Within this path of living, dying, living, which we are all on, the reality is it is an extremely painful phenomenon.

96
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,480
right, right, right.

97
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,360
It simply is a sea of pain.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,400
Only when you reach this stage of unreality or nothingness within Buddha can you finally transcend it.

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
So I think with this kind of expansive backdrop,

100
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,080
a Buddhist backdrop, compassion is an emotion that naturally arises.

101
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,680
right, right, right.

102
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,560
It's nothing difficult to understand.

103
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,120
There is nothing that you can't forgive.

104
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,280
All people are the same.

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,440
Also within this novel I started to include the spirit of self-reflection.

106
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,120
In the past I was just looking at the negative aspects  of people,  their faults,

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,040
I was always looking at the scars and scabs other people left on me

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,400
But when I wrote "Life and Death" I started to self-reflect.

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,840
Say I truly received harm from another person.

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,120
But have I also done harm to others in my life?

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,080
If I want others to understand me, I must first understand others.

112
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,920
right.

113
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,560
This way I feel like we're looking from a rather high point down onto human society.

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,520
From a sober foundation, giving up our own ego, I try to understand others.

115
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,040
Right. I think you said this really well. You especially moved me.
