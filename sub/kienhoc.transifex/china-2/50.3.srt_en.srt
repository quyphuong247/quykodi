1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,740
With the founding the People's Republic in 1949,

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,180
Mao Zedong set the country on a development path

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,400
committed to the unrestrained exploitation

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,110
of natural resources for human gain.

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,020
As he said in 1966, "if people living in nature want to be free,

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,480
they will have to overcome and change nature.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,490
Only then will they obtain freedom from nature."

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,050
"Man must conquer nature," was one of his slogans.

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,560
"Battling with nature is boundless joy," another of the slogans of his time.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,350
Mao's first systematic assault on the environment during the Great Leap

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,550
Forward of 1958 to the early 1960s aimed to catch up

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,300
with the industrialized west in 15 years or less.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,320
And to achieve this goal, he mobilized a great intensification

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,879
of agricultural and industrial production.

15
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,360
Grain was planted everywhere-- on almost all cultivated land

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,530
regardless of its suitability.

17
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,080
This led to temporarily increased grain harvests

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,520
and to the widespread despoiling of land that had been better suited

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,450
to other crops, such as potatoes or peanuts.

20
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,770
To industrialize the countryside overnight,

21
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,150
Mao urged the widespread construction of backyard steel smelters.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,870
These amateur furnishes not only melted down useful household items

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,670
like pots and bed frames, but also consumed

24
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,270
enormous amounts of fuel and polluted the air.

25
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,390
Perhaps 10% of China's forests were turned to ash for this scheme.

26
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,646
