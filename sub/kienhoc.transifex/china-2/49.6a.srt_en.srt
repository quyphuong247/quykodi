1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,900
BILL KIRBY: So let's take look at a few pictures of this and then move on.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,780
And then also we have a little bit of a--

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:29,830
but this is Kunshan, which, if you look at this, it's high speed rail.

4
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,090
If you drive from here to Kunshan, it's about an hour, an hour

5
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,460
and a half in horrific traffic often enough.

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,710
High speed rail is 18 minutes.

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,610
18 minutes.

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,169
Just so humiliating when you come back to this country and look at Amtrak.

9
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,960
You go there, and it's a very modern place.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,184
It's not a boondocks place in the least.

11
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,350
And it's a carefully develop city, because it really

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,160
will have been planned only in the last 20 years as a modern city.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,740
Here's high speed rail that will-- now think of what it takes to succeed.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,270
Do you think it's easy to get two high speed rail stops?

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,950
These guys are politically really good somehow or other.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,440
It's not easy to have those kinds of resources come to your hometown.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,520
Whole cities in the course of history-- American, European,

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,840
and Chinese history-- have atrophied from missing out

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,860
on connections to train lines, or highways, and so on.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,830
Kunshan is extremely well positioned.

21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,330
It's been visited by the leaders of the country many, many times

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,030
to declare it to be a model.

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,400
And it is of course a model of strollers.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,396
Here's Good Baby, the company.

25
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:39,270
And look at these incredible strollers-- that

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,680
is, that you can find your own stroller here.

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,230
Look at that happy, happy, happy baby here.

28
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,550
And this is a homegrown company of a certain sort.

29
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,465
And then here is Duke.

30
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:55,980
STUDENT: This is built?

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,290
BILL KIRBY: This is built now.

32
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,870
When this picture was taken, it wasn't built.

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,703
And I will show you.

34
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:05,610
This is DKU, just opening now in this extraordinary campus.

35
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,320
It's a collaboration-- well, you know all this.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,370
This will be for our online friends.

37
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,650
This gives a sense in Duke's role.

38
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,652
This is just the first phase, which is now complete,

39
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:21,980
of the campus of a 200 acre residential campus.

40
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,740
There's the executive vice chancellor, Marry Bullock,

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,600
and the chancellor, Chancellor Liu, former president of Wuhan University.

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,170
Really a dynamic-- she's a very senior China scholar

43
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,970
and chair of the China Medical Board, former president of Agnes Scott

44
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,040
College.

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,230
And we have the aspirations we're thinking about

46
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,640
that Duke has for DKU and the aspirations for Kunshan--

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,417
for its economic development, a knowledge economy,

48
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,500
international partnership.

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,420
Also for Wuhan University, their partner--

50
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,850
interesting partnership-- a great research university.

51
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,560
Perhaps far enough away so that it isn't involved in the day

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,800
to day activities of the enterprise.

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,480
Very strongly supported by the Chinese Ministry of Education,

54
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,630
which sees this-- really as I do-- as the most

55
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,380
important international investment and commitment to Chinese

56
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,350
higher education since the founding of Yenching University in 1928.

57
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,640
Duke's strategy of program development beginning

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,010
with an undergraduate semesters, research centers, executive education,

59
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,680
and particularly with graduate degrees in phase one--

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,400
moving toward undergraduate degree programs and more research operation.

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,470
This is some look at the construction as I followed it

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,850
over the last several years.

63
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,610


64
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:53,700
And some take-aways here-- this remarkable history of development

65
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,620
of Kunshan, ideally a symmetry of benefits.

66
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,400
We shall see.

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,280
It just opened.

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,690
Here is Kun Opera, and there was a Kun Opera

69
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,990
to celebrate the opening of DKU, sung with a North Carolina accent.

70
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,760
I have no idea.

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,079
Here is the enterprise as it looks today, and a classroom,

72
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,769
and dorm rooms that are like hotel rooms.

73
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,470


74
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,960
This really blew me away when I saw this.

75
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,090
I'm sure that-- yeah.

76
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,280
[LAUGHTER]

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,900
Yeah, I have to say that if you compared this with our freshman yard

78
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,990
we have-- and this is the opening just this last year.

79
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,180
You never know what will happen in construction.

80
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,970
When I was watching over the construction of this,

81
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,910
there were-- one has to be careful.

82
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,190
Kunshan has never built anything like this,

83
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,470
and so construction was a little slow.

84
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,600
And when I asked one of the Chinese foreman

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,170
why is the construction so slow, he said, oh these Duke people,

86
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,090
they want corners like this.

87
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,100
But it's an extraordinary success.

88
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:16,800
