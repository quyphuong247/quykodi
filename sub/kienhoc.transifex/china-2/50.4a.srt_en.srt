00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,580
Mao's rule did have some unintended benefits for the environment.

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,720
Because under his rule, the modern Chinese economy

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,310
grew much more slowly than it had before or after-- much more

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,450
slowly than the economies of its Asia-Pacific neighbors

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,390
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,190
And while Maoism proved to be very destructive of natural environments,

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,090
it was an unconscious conservator of built environments,

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,810
for it built so little that lasted.

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,560
Throughout the 1980s and '90s, people in towns and cities all over the country

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,860
began to prosper, especially in eastern China

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,060
in places like Wuxi, the Yangzi River Delta,

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,100
and in South China, the Pearl River Delta.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,240
However, economic growth was accompanied by escalating environmental abuse.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,989
Growing degradation and under-investment in the environment

15
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,390
are reflected in the quality of China's water, air, land, and biodiversity,

16
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,100
and indeed, human health.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:18,783
