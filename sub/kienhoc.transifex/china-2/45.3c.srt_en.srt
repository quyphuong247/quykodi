[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,830


3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,000
Is there a theme that you could imagine--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,100
it doesn't mean that it's happened-- that would be galvanizing

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,080
more than locally, that would take a form that would be rather

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,680
difficult for the regime to ignore as movement?

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,930
I mean, one could imagine Falun Gong is a potential threat-- perhaps one could

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,160
argue-- that they saw in Master Li-- the Hong

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,180
Xiuquan of the 21st-- or the late 20th century,

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,630
and they nipped that movement in the bud.

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,790
What about a nationwide environment movement in this regard?

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,290
Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,675
The environment--

14
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:46,260
Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,580
--movement paid a large part in Taiwan's democratization--

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,080
Mm-hmm.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,860
--in the 1970s and the 1980s in a way in which the Guomindang really

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,350
had no easy defense.

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,920
Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,980
And indeed, tried to co-opt it in its own way,

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,000
but it was a very powerful plank of the DPP platform at that time.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,730
Can you imagine there being such a theme?

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,840
I can definitely imagine such a theme.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,370
As you suggested, religion is sometimes a source,

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,540
or spiritual kinds of movements are sometimes a source of the sort of theme

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,280
that can galvanize people, like the Taiping Rebellion under Hong

27
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,610
Xiuquan in the mid-19th century, like Falun Gong in the 20th century.

28
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,670
Environmental movement would be another one.

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,260
Obviously, the environmental crisis that China currently faces--

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,260
far more devastating than what Taiwan had to--

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,760
Yes.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,340
--deal with at an earlier age.

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,140
And both religion and environmental movements

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,180
were very important in the democratization

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,255
of Taiwan, the churches--

36
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:42,755
Yes.

37
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:48,330
--in Taiwan and also in South Korea played very important roles.

38
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,400
Those would be possibilities.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,650
In my own thinking, perhaps even a more likely candidate

40
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,380
for a movement that would galvanize people

41
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,090
across different geographical areas and different social classes

42
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,210
might be a nationalist movement.

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,789
Nationalism is something that is really difficult for the PRC government

44
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:12,330
to deal with.

45
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,810
It's a very slippery issue.

46
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,370
Because on the one hand, of course, the state

47
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,860
promotes nationalism, promotes patriotism, and much of the television

48
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,660
footage and much of the education in China is about the Second World War,

49
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,390
about anti-Japanese nationalism, which was so important

50
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,990
in the growth of the Chinese Communist movement itself.

51
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,290
We see again and again nationalist protests in China

52
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,530
that, often in their very early stages, appear

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,700
to have a good deal of government support--

54
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,520
sometimes even government mobilization and organization behind them.

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,870
But nationalist movements are also very tricky for the government

56
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,580
because, when students get out there-- not just students, but primarily

57
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,560
students, but others as well-- perhaps protesting

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,910
against Japan's involvement in the Diaoyu Islands, and the like,

59
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,480
they're calling for a very strong state to be able to meet that foreign threat.

60
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,450
And that call for a very strong state can also

61
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,700
be an implicit critique of the state for actually not being strong enough,

62
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,390
not being able to stand up in the international world

63
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,640
and exert the kind of muscle and clout that a young Chinese nationalist might

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,690
like to see.

65
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:34,980
So in the last big round of nationalist protests in China,

66
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,770
a year ago in September, that were on the anniversary

67
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,860
of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in the early 1930s,

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,830
it was very interesting that, in those protests, large numbers of protesters

69
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,840
were holding posters of Chairman Mao.

70
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,290
So on the one hand, of course, Chairman Mao

71
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,790
is an image that is endorsed by the center.

72
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,980
They certainly have not denounced Mao, and his image still

73
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,540
towers above Tiananmen Square in the center

74
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,110
of the political capital in China.

75
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,710
But on the other hand, by holding up posters of Mao,

76
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:17,350
the protesters also appeared to be offering a kind of oblique critique

77
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,940
of the regime-- suggesting that Mao was symbolic of an earlier,

78
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,990
stronger, more pure, less corrupt China.

79
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,780
And that's a very dangerous kind of critique for the current leadership.

80
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,640
So I think nationalism is very slippery, especially

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,630
because it's very hard to know what the difference between "nationalism"

82
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,910
and sort of "Chinese state nationalism" and "Chinese cultural nationalism,"

83
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,950
if you will.

84
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,760
China, of course, has 50-some minorities who

85
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,670
do not self-identify as Han Chinese, including Tibetans, Uyghur in Xinjiang,

86
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,630
and so forth.

87
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,150
"Nationalism" also has a very different meaning

88
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,570
for those who do self-identify as Han Chinese versus those

89
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,080
who are considered as national minorities.

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,240
So I think it's a particularly difficult issue for the Chinese state,

91
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,120
and I could well imagine a nationalist protest that is not well-handled--

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,330
whether it's a nationalist protest by Chinese in China proper

93
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,600
or whether it's a somewhat secessionist-colored protest by Uyghur

94
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,280
in Xinjiang or by Tibetans either in Tibet or in the Tibetan regions

95
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
of the rest of China.

96
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,760
Those kinds of demonstrations can, I think,

97
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,970
be very tough for the regime to handle.

98
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:47,179
