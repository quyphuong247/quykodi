00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:11,910
WILLIAM KIRBY: I'm here at the Jingji Guanli Xueyuan of Tsinghua University,

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,080
the School of Economics and Management, which is, as I've said before,

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,580
maybe the most difficult school to get into in the world.

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,920
And so any students who have come through Tsinghua Jingji Guanli Xueyuan

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,930
are by definition among the most talented students in China

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,600
and by definition among the most talented students in the world.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,190
They've had a rigorous education in economics and management

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,660
and in a series of other majors.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,150
They also, in recent years, have one of the most advanced

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,950
programs of general education that Dean Qian Yingyi

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,170
has introduced to this school, experimenting

12
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,910
with aspects of a liberal education within the confines of what,

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,040
from an outside point of view, would seem to be a business school.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,180
So I'm asking here, this incredibly talented group

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,017
of people, three questions, basically.

16
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:06,100
First to tell us something about their background.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,090
What is their laojia?

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,120
Where are they from?

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,440
Where are their families from?

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,640
What are their roots?

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,430
Second, what have they studied here at Tsinghua?

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,590
And where do they think those studies will take them?

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,270
Immediately, where do they want to go after Tsinghua?

24
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,110
And third, to have them reflect a moment about what

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,940
are, from their perspective, the strengths and the challenges

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,500
facing Chinese education, particularly higher education today.

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,190
So.

28
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,790
CINDY: My name's Xu Xin and my English name is Cindy.

29
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,730
I'm a Ph.D. student here, studying finance.

30
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,080
I came from a small town in south China, Anhui province.

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,810
Well, I'm very lucky to get the offer from one

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,930
of the leading international organizations, the International

33
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,200
Monetary Fund.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,060
Pretty exciting about that.

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,870
Let me talk about the strength of our higher education system here.

36
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,680
I think our Chinese students in college, we

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,130
are pretty good at statistical analyzing.

38
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,820
And also, we are good at mathematics.

39
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,460


40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,370
We study very hard at textbook.

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,960
And we have pretty good teamwork spirit.

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,720
In terms of disadvantages or challenges, I

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,470
think in the future our college should encourage more interaction

44
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,060
between students and the society.

45
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,650
And we should learn more about the real world.

46
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,240
And also, we should encourage more critical thinking.

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,770
That's very important for innovation and entrepreneurship spirit in the future.

48
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,100
Key for our country to grow sustainably.

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,070
Well, that's all.

50
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,880
Thank you.

51
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,380
RI KO: Hi.

52
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,110
Hello.

53
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,420
My name is Ri Ko.

54
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,770
I'm from Heilongjiang province.

55
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,700
That's in northeast of China, very far away from Beijing.

56
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,810
And I'm a Ph.D. Student in Tsinghua University

57
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,060
and my major is economics and finance.

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm going to graduate soon in July and get my Ph.D. Degree.

59
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,540
And I'm going to maybe devote myself to some public service

60
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,700
in some local area in China.

61
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,050
And in my opinion, China's higher education

62
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,900
focus more on the textbook learning, but not on education, not

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,490
on human education.

64
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,490
Actually, the Tsinghua University is a leading University in China.

65
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:48,800
And Tsinghua has already provided us a real liberal education.

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,840
But I think, in most other universities, textbook learning

67
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,150
is also the most important one.

68
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,530
So, in this way, in one hand, our Chinese students,

69
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,760
usually have some solid knowledge, but on the other hand,

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,620
we lack the ability of creativity.

71
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,250
We seldom to have some new ideas.

72
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,459
I think that's a shortcoming of our higher education.

73
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:16,959
OK.

74
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,329
Thank you.

75
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:18,870
ALLEN: Hello.

76
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,319
My name is Jin Xinye and my English name is Allen.

77
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm from Liaoning province, also the northeast of China.

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,890
And I just finished my undergraduate here at Tsinghua.

79
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:40,860
And I'm now the first year Ph.D. student.

80
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,260
If asked where I will go after graduation,

81
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,930
I'm not sure where I will go because I'm just a freshman.

82
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,090
But if only I have the chance like her or him,

83
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,480
I think I would take that great opportunity.

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:05,280
So what is the strength and the weakness of Tsinghua students.

85
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:14,530
I think that our weakness is that we are not that familiar with America

86
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,040
like American students.

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,130
But I think our strength is we study very hard.

88
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,670
We study very well.

89
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,220
And we have a good knowledge.

90
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,190
So I think that's our strength and our opportunity.

91
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,959
Thank you.

92
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,500
SUSIE: Hello.

93
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,150
My name Wu Shuyu and my English name is Susie.

94
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,700
I come from Jiangsu province.

95
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,300
It's in the southeast of China.

96
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,674
And I also had my bachelor's degree here in the School

97
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:50,840
of Economics and Management.

98
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,510
And my major, my undergraduate major is also economics and finance.

99
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,270
And now, I'm a second year Ph.D. Student here,

100
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,450
Ph.D student of Professor David Daokui.

101
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,120
My research focus is the internationalization of RMB.

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:18,310
And just as my research focus, I hope in the future, I can do some academic job.

103
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:28,660
I hope I can work in some international organizations like Xu Xin does.

104
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,480
As for the strength and weakness of the Chinese education,

105
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,980
I think the strength is that we Chinese students all work very hard.

106
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,240
And we did very good job in the textbook learning.

107
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,380
However, as for the weakness, I think we spent too much time in the textbook

108
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,100
learning and we rarely have any time to go outside

109
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,730
to learn from the world outside.

110
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,990
And we always devote all our time in school.

111
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:06,280
Yeah, I think that's-- yeah, that's the weakness for us Chinese students

112
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,370
and for the Chinese educational system.

113
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,100
WILLIAM KIRBY: So in speaking with our Tsinghua SEM students,

114
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,390
School of Economics and Management is one

115
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,930
of the themes, which is one we hear so commonly in China

116
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,500
and sometimes outside of China, is that China is outstanding at creating people

117
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,710
with deep knowledge in disciplines, the students are very hardworking,

118
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,800
but in some way that the university system or the school system before this

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,040
is not innovative enough.

120
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,320
And many Chinese think for reasons that are not always clear to me,

121
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,730
that the Chinese are hardworking and pragmatic

122
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,570
and the Americas are lazy and creative.

123
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,690


124
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,510
But I think, personally, that one seriously

125
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,670
underestimates the capacity for innovation here in China.

126
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,100
Professor Li Daokui was just telling us about China

127
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,060
being forced to innovate because it faces challenges of the kind

128
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,900
that the rest of the world simply does not have.

129
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,860
Also, I think as a historian, China has not

130
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,830
become the longest continuous civilization on earth

131
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,230
by failing to adapt and failing to innovate.

132
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,840
MICHAEL: Thank you, Professor Kirby.

133
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,429
I'm Michael Haochung and I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student in this school, SEM,

134
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,700
of Tsinghua University.

135
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,210
And I was born in Shandong province, a place with great history

136
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,179
and civilization and very beautiful, my hometown.

137
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,580
And I was brought up in a small city.

138
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,260
And I have relatives, close relatives in my family,

139
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,170
they are living in the rural areas of China.

140
00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:01,550
So from very young, I'm amazed by the stark difference between lifestyles

141
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,540
of the people living in rural area and living in urban area.

142
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,050
So I'm amazed by the rapid development of China's economic and China's

143
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,160
development in recent years.

144
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,410
And so I convert from a major in biology to major

145
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,280
in economics for my Ph.D. study.

146
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,430
And for the question about the challenge and the strength of Chinese

147
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,190
higher education, and I'll apply basic principles of economic.

148
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,530
So the strength is on the demand side.

149
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,000
Because in China, we have a huge population.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,820
And there's 25 million young men at my age.

151
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,710
And so there's a huge market for higher education.

152
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:56,480
But for the challenge side is on the supply side of higher education.

153
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,850
And what I mean by supply side, means by the faculty,

154
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,040
by the softwares and hardwares of universities.

155
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,650
So that's our challenge facing by Chinese higher education.

156
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,780
And for my career goal, I try to find some research post

157
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,640
in thinktank or some universities, both domestic and aboard.

158
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,180
And my thesis is about the Chinese real estate

159
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,910
market and the Chinese financial system.

160
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,530
And I'm very interested in China's economic development and the world

161
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,350
economy.

162
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,900
And I'm trying to become the expert on Chinese economic and China study.

163
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,960
Thank you.

164
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,640
SOPHIE: My name is Jin Xuewei, and Professor Kirby,

165
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,210
you can call me Sophie.

166
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,150
I come from Xinjiang province, the northwest of China

167
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,290
and it is a beautiful place.

168
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,060
And it's my last year in Tsinghua.

169
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,040
I major in economics and finance here.

170
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,180
And I'll get my bachelor's degree in July.

171
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,150
And after that, I think I'll go to a Korean fashion

172
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,870
company as my first career.

173
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,780
And after that, I think maybe two or three years later,

174
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:22,150
I'll go back to campus to go on my further study.

175
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,490
And about the question, what do I think about the advantage

176
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,910
of higher education in China.

177
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,900
I think as Chen Hao said, China has a very large population.

178
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,120
What I must mention is the diversity.

179
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,210
Because China has a large population, student like us,

180
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:51,770
we come from different provinces and we have different personalities.

181
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:57,090
So I think we can learn much from each other.

182
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,290
So I think it's our advantage.

183
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,617
Thank you.

184
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:02,450
SEAN: Hi, everybody.

185
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,330
My name is Xu Xiang and my English name is Sean.

186
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,970
I'm a third year PhD student here and my major is finance.

187
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,660
I think I will go to Harvard in the next year as a visiting

188
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,520
fellow to the Fairbanks Center.

189
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,880
So if you happen to see in Harvard campus, please feel free to say hello.

190
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,930
I come from Anhui province.

191
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,370
It's very hard to judge we are in the north of China or south of China.

192
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,240
We are really having a debate on that.

193
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,710
But my hometown is Hefei, which is the capital of Anhui.

194
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:40,030
Just like many Chinese cities, middle sized city with many students

195
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,100
and with many people.

196
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,810
So if you want to come to Tsinghua, you really have to make an effort.

197
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,350
About my career, I want to talk about my research interests first.

198
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,810
My research topic is like restructuring Chinese economy and global rebalancing.

199
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,970
And my career is closely related to my research topic.

200
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,680
Just like what I said before, I think I'm just

201
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,540
going to connect the Chinese problem to international issues,

202
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,100
so that I think I will try to do some research first based on China

203
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,150
and try to extend it to an international level.

204
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:18,680
And try to think about the world economy and also things like politics,

205
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,700
in a Chinese background or in a Chinese voice.

206
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,520
If I can do that, I think I can not only make a contribution to my own country

207
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,580
and also to the world.

208
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,320
And that's what my mentor, my advisor, Professor David Li

209
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,396
has always been telling us about.

210
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,000
About the strengths and weaknesses of the Chinese education system,

211
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,400
I think it's very clear-- two very clear points that we should think about.

212
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,830
About the advantages or strengths of Chinese education system,

213
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,570
I think it's that the system itself is being this learning.

214
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,880
We have learned from the American education system, like how we manage

215
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,930
or how we compose our universities.

216
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,660
We have learned from the English system, like we

217
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,410
have now the Schwarzman college, just like the Rhodes Scholars.

218
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,760
And we have learned from Japan.

219
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,080
We have learned from places like Australia.

220
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,940
So as long as our system is learning, I think we'll make more and more progress

221
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,470
and will be much better.

222
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,380
About the weakness of the Chinese education system now,

223
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,220
I think we lack some kind of continuity.

224
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,240
If you come from high school, which is my experience,

225
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,570
which is relatively high, very intensive.

226
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,240
Like the teachers and the mentors will push you very fierce

227
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,940
or push you very hard to try to get you into the highest universities in China.

228
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,930
But when you come to Tsinghua or Peking University

229
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,070
or any of the best universities, there will be nobody pushing you.

230
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,390
So I know some of the students who were really good in their high school years,

231
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,970
they may be the top one in their province,

232
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,240
but after they have come to Tsinghua, they

233
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,110
will drop the school like in only half a year.

234
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,330
So why things like this?

235
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,110
Because we have so many people and we have different education ways or modes

236
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,380
for different places.

237
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:17,090
And I think maybe a trend to stop this problem is that we should let the lower

238
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,640
level of education, like elementary level,

239
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,530
and also like high-- not high school-- maybe like primary schools,

240
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,270
we have more connections or let the schools learn from each other more.

241
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,290
And try to train or try to make up students

242
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,920
with very comprehensive learning skills and the ability

243
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,810
to teach themselves so that they will be adapt to the global needs now.

244
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,210
And they can be the student that China needs now,

245
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,400
with very high English skills and with the ability to communicate people

246
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,680
and with the ability to communicate things

247
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,760
and with the ability to make things out.

248
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,430
I think that's my suggestion for the whole system.

249
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,070
Thank you very much.

250
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,111
WILLIAM KIRBY: Thank you.

251
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:59,890
So we've had a really very interesting conversation

252
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,580
with an extraordinarily talented group of students, undergraduate and graduate

253
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,440
students from Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management.

254
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,892
Very diverse group in terms of geographic diversity, which

255
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:14,850
tells you something about their accomplishments

256
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,800
because Tsinghua University is very difficult to get into no matter what,

257
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,206
but it's even harder to get into if you don't live in Beijing.

258
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:24,840
And so no one here is from Beijing, which

259
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,140
I think is a very interesting thing.

260
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,070
And the odds of getting in from Anhui are much,

261
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,630
much higher than they are from Beijing.

262
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,220
And they're very difficult in any event.

263
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,230
And we've talked a little bit and Sean was just

264
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,720
mentioning about how universities learn from each other.

265
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,880
And how great universities learn and emulate each other.

266
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,530
Harvard, if we were to think of university rankings 100 years ago,

267
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:58,960
would not have been number one, as though I hope it is today.

268
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,040
It would not have been number 10.

269
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,550
Might have been lucky to be in the top 20 in the world.

270
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,819
100 years ago, probably eight of the 10 best universities in the world

271
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,160
would have been German universities.

272
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,810
Today, at least according to the Shanghai Jiao Tong university

273
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,130
rankings of universities, not one of the top 40 universities in the world

274
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,804
is a German university.

275
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:27,000
Now, the Germans disagree and they may be right,

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,600
but nevertheless it shows you, in a broad sense,

277
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,050
that the world changes and can change in rather dramatic ways.

278
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:40,002
Now a place like Tsinghua University is rising rapidly in global rankings.

279
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,740
It will be one of the leading universities

280
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:49,510
in the world without question, in I think a very short period of time.

281
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,150
Every university, in particular every elite university,

282
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,810
whether it's Tsinghua, Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley,

283
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,750
Michigan, claims not just to educate people

284
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,890
but to train and educate leaders.

285
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,610
I don't know of any university in the world who in their propaganda

286
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,440
or brochures says that they don't educate leaders, they only

287
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,810
educate followers.

288
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:18,170
But there's a much bigger market for followers than there is for leaders.

289
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,180
We all claim to educate leaders.

290
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,415
I can guarantee you if we were to interview

291
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:27,700
this extraordinary group of young people 10 and 20 years from now,

292
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:34,240
we will find that Tsinghua University has educated a generation of leaders.

293
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,571
