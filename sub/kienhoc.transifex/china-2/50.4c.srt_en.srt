00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,180
Let's talk about air.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,920
In the past, Chinese feared dust storms from Mongolia.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,420
They're still there.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,220
But today, they fear also the deadly smog

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,160
that plagues virtually every major metropolis in China.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,620
Modernizing, no matter the cost, China has

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:36,170
become notorious both for creating and suffering from serious air pollution.

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,630
Describing Beijing smog in 2013, the year

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,580
of what has been called there air-pocalypse,

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,800
a reporter for the Guardian newspaper Jonathan Kaiman wrote,

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,930
quote "100 on the air quality index correlates

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,750
to a thin gray gauze hovering above the horizon.

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,060
When the index for particulate matter hits 200,

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,570
the sky is visible only in a small patch directly overhead.

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,910
And air quality index reading of 300 blots out the sun,

16
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,140
smothering the city in drab uniformity.

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,590
When the air quality index reached 755 on the 12th of January, the worst day

18
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,220
on record, the air felt like industrial smoke-- chemical tasting,

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,700
high watering."

20
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,610
Much of China's air pollution is connected to dependence on coal

21
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,040
as an energy source.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,320
China's not only the world's biggest producer of coal,

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,190
it also burns nearly half of all the coal burned globally.

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,190
The burning of solid fuels-- coal and biomass-- for energy,

25
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,340
contributes to both outdoor and indoor air pollution, which are respectively

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:56,920
responsible for an estimated 300,000 and 400,000 premature deaths every year.

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,510
Coal, much of it so-called dirty coal, provides as much as 70%

28
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,260
of China's energy.

29
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,800
China passed the United States as the world's greatest producer of greenhouse

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,880
gases-- this is an unhappy competition-- in 2007

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,420
and it has surpassed both the global average of emissions per capita

32
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,380
as well as the per capita emissions of some European countries.

33
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,460
According to Greenpeace, China's coal consumption accounted for about half

34
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:34,360
of global CO2 emissions growth in the past 10 years.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,280
With China possessing the world's largest automobile market

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,460
and with urbanisation expected to consolidate over

37
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,420
60% percent of Chinese population in cities in the next 20 years,

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,720
managing these emissions will continue to be a major challenge.

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,798
