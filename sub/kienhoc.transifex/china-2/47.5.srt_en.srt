1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,430
So now what is Wanxiang American?

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,930
Adriann.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,590
So it was set up in 1993 by Ni Pin.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,840
By Ni Pin.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,611
The son-in-law.

6
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:15,110
Son-in-law.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,870
Son-in-law.

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,495
Remember how important sons-in-law are.

9
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,786
It's basically what the author, as you guys use, as a match-making strategy.

10
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:21,660
That's what you said.

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,993
That they would look for these companies that they were struggling, essentially.

12
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:28,240
And they felt that they could potentially relieve them or bring them

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,260
back to a better economic state.

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,760
Right.

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,593
So they're buying up what kind of companies?

16
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:34,500
Other manufacturing companies.

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,850
Other auto parts manufacturers companies.

18
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,294
This is in the 1990s.

19
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:40,210
Now if you guys know anything about American--

20
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,839
and they do so continuing through the 2000s.

21
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:47,130
Are there a lot of people buying up American auto parts

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,180
companies in this period of time?

23
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,130
Is this a great and growth industry?

24
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,780


25
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,430
It's catastrophic.

26
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,570
Going through a depression, or recession after depression.

27
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,649
They have a vision that this industry's going to survive.

28
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,940
Because they have this business model of this expansion

29
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,410
plan of the producing at China's cost and selling at US prices.

30
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,890
So they want to gain access to the US market so that they can do that.

31
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,390
Right.

32
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,900
And what are US prices versus Chinese prices of labor?

33
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,740
The US price of labor is much higher.

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,057
Something if they can utilize--

35
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:21,520
How much higher?

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,323
A lot.

37
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:23,230
I forget the number.

38
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,650
It was like nine cents.

39
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,550
Like 30 times higher?

40
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,636
Something like that.

41
00:01:27,636 --> 00:01:31,200
It's 20 cents for a Chinese worker per hour, and it's $22.

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,240
$22.00.

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,205
So basically 22 to one.

44
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,390
25 to one.

45
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,910
Something-- yeah, Sara.

46
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,130
Is this one of the first Chinese companies that's actually buying up

47
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,460
US companies, or have there been many previous?

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,750
This is one of the very first to enter the United States, and with a strategy.

49
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,540
The auto parts industry is in great distress.

50
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,510
So there are real opportunities.

51
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,890
You have companies closing, and this company, Wanxiang,

52
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,230
saves actually thousands and thousands of American jobs

53
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,380
in companies that otherwise would have gone under all together.

54
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,400
They have this matchmaking strategy Adriann has just described.

55
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,160
Trying to find the ones that fit their corporate niche very well.

56
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,055
What is their branding strategy?

57
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:17,555
Jake.

58
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,570
They decided to keep the brands of the company they takeover

59
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,689
rather than branding it with Wanxiang.

60
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,230
That's right.

61
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:30,280
So Julius Pontiac, this relic of the American automobile

62
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,340
industry, and it's history, has probably Acme--

63
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,840
I'm just making up the name-- Acme brakes that may be Wanxiang brakes.

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,940
Wanxiang may own Acme, but they'd maintained actually,

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,520
for continuity of sales and reputation, these fine American auto

66
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,210
parts companies, and they don't call them Wanxiang.

67
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,530
So they're under the radar screen.

68
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,010
Rose-Ann.

69
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,410
I think they also had a very large emphasis

70
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,660
on ensuring that their quality was the best that you could find.

71
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,690
High quality.

72
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,920
So they don't-- they're very conscious even though they don't use their own

73
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,000
brand, of very conscious of maintaining their reputation.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,500
Jasmine.

75
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,208
They really wanted to keep a low profile,

76
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:13,600
because they wanted to appear as an unthreatening partner --

77
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,100
Right.

78
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,170
So you think if suddenly we're known in the 1990s

79
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,200
that everybody's brakes are made by "The Chinese,"

80
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,720
even though it's a private company, not a government company.

81
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,508
Who knows?

82
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:25,757
There are a variety of things.

83
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:28,670


84
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,030
So basically, the way that I saw them fitting into the operation of China

85
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,000
is Wanxiang China office could leverage their capacity

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,610
to manufacture all these components, and then send them to America, where

87
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,770
a little bit of value add, which is not really precise in the case,

88
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,830
would be done in America.

89
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,702
And then you leverage the brand that you're actually buying.

90
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:49,910
Are you saying that part of it is kind of a warehouse

91
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,170
operation for selling Chinese goods in the states?

92
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,670
Exactly.

93
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,270
With a little bit of value add, which is not entirely sure what.

94
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,870
But I think the biggest value add is probably

95
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,850
is in the brands that they're acquiring, and the ability

96
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,530
to sell these Chinese products.

97
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,280
And then those brands which allow them to earn the prices.

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,424
US brands.

99
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:16,820
In a way, they're doing it in a very stealthy manner.

100
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,823
So when they did all the M & A, they kept all the brands , like Adrian said.

101
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:25,751
I think they also leveraged their existing house markets that way.

102
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:29,679
They started doing those by on the Chinese side.

103
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,610
It's really a good idea because--

104
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,562
Why is it a good idea?

105
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:36,846
Well, if you take into account this is 1980s, during that time

106
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:43,816
there was a lot of backlash against Asian M & A.

107
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:44,690
Chinese, or Japanese?

108
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,100
Japanese, actually.

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,800
But I don't think Americans at the time really distinguished the two.

110
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,086
So the fact that they were able to stay under the radar,

111
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:59,980
at least in the American minds, prevented a lot of backlash

112
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,377
towards any additional M & A.

113
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:05,585
Is that what you -- You think that's a good strategy?

114
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,945


115
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:13,140
What's another aspect of why you would keep the name of an American parts--

116
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,716
your now own the company.

117
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,240
You may have saved a bunch of jobs.

118
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,210
Victoria?

119
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,090
So people buy it.

120
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,180
So people buy it.

121
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,690
Right.

122
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,120
Because they're used to buying it.

123
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,078
They have a reputation.

124
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,420
They have quality.

125
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,156
And then you're buying it in part to get access to that quality.

126
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:30,320
To that technology.

127
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,820
Yeah.

128
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,510
Please, Yili.

129
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,630
So when we talk about M&A, we talk about BSSE.

130
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,075
So there are two basic strategy to M&A. One

131
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:43,070
is that you acquire, you absorb them to your home company.

132
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,630
Because you want resources.

133
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,846
But in this case the value rewards, is a brand processed --

134
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:52,192
and unique culture of doing business in America.

135
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:55,820
So you have to keep them separate and independent

136
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,910
so that you can realize all their so-called synergy,

137
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,180
otherwise if you call it Wanxiang, call it a Chinese company, then it just--

138
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,620
it won't work.

139
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,588
It's an absolutely good--

140
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:12,372
It's the right way to do things and use the local people

141
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,764
from that same culture.

142
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:17,350
How many people does Wanxiang America employ in this case?

143
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,062
So, I don't remember exact number, but it's

144
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:22,650
thousands of people with only 15 Chinese.

145
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,466
Only 15 Chinese overseeing.

146
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:28,720
Here's kind of a question, is it a Chinese company or an American company,

147
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,290
or series of American companies, with some Chinese oversight.

148
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,040
Or--

149
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,272
It's just-- you can say it's an American company, but maybe the leadership of it

150
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:41,250
is basically Chinese.

151
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,125
Do you think that Mr. Lu still has something to do with this company?

152
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,424


153
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:49,388
I mean like has influence, definitely, but--

154
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:50,870
You think he has influence, OK.

155
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,050


156
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,200
I'm going to interrupt.

157
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,980
Just one second.

158
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,610
Excuse me.

159
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,972
How often do you talk to Mr. Lu?

160
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,470
You mean talk about business, not something else?

161
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,571
Just business.

162
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,070
Business?

163
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,080
Not much.

164
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,820
Oh, OK.

165
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,380
That's an answer to your question.

166
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,208
We do talk almost everyday.

167
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:13,708
OK.

168
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,208
Everyday.

169
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,340
That's a very good son-in-law.

170
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,110


171
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,970
He call me.

172
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,660


173
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,190
I told him before long distance-- it was a lot more expensive--

174
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,920
In the old days.

175
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,836
Yeah, in the old days.

176
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:34,980
So I say you call me, but I'm not going to call you.

177
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,380


178
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,880
Tell me more about Wanxiang America.

179
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,755
What else do they do?

180
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:44,110
Debbie, what else are they up to?

181
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,210
So I agree, I think that operational, they seem very locally run.

182
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,140
But I think strategically, it was very much

183
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,620
run from China, in sort of the strategic vision of Mr. Lu.

184
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,790
I think one noteworthy point is the fact that they

185
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,240
were sort of finding arbitrage in low Chinese labor, and manufacturing.

186
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,740
And then high US prices.

187
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,065
And I think at that time, they were this matchmaker

188
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:09,590
because they have knowledge of what was going on in China.

189
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,430
What's the supply demand condition there?

190
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,480
And then what's the supply and demand condition in the US,

191
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,400
and they were able to -- and find the profit.

192
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,290
Which I'm sot so sure is the case.

193
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:25,680
And of the various ones in the case that they are-- the US companies that they

194
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,660
take over, what's their success rate?

195
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,620
I think they do pretty well.

196
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,285
They noted the two failures, but--

197
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:34,539
There are a couple failures.

198
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,620
But on the whole, if you were worried about the Chinese taking

199
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,524
over the world, would you be worried about Wanxiang?

200
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,780
Taking over the world?

201
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,520
Well, how about taking over American companies.

202
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,720
Just think kind of things that come up every four years --

203
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,910
election cycles or so.

204
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,650
And they own all of these-- the auto industry

205
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,030
used to be the heart of the American economy.

206
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,862
Now the Chinese own all the parts.

207
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:01,320
Well, they don't own all the parts.

208
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:09,835
But I'm just exaggerating this to what somebody-- and yet nobody says this.

209
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,740
Maybe because no one knows.

210
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,260
No one knows, and I think they do a good job in sort of staying under the radar.

211
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,174
But I think some people, even I think, someone from the Zeller Company

212
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:23,545
even said that they wanted this buyout to happen because it's either

213
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:27,330
the Chinese buying them out, or bankruptcy, or taking a loss of jobs.

214
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,885
So I do think that while there is this nationalistic, protectionist aspect

215
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:39,050
of keeping the car business owned by US companies,

216
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,140
I think it's kind of like the lesser evil.

217
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,420
So I don't think everybody was against it.

218
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,400
So, yeah, please.

219
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,950
Nick.

220
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,100
What I thought was interesting about their strategy was it seemed to be,

221
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,070
to borrow a quote, "crossing the river by feeling for stones,"

222
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,066
and they didn't really know what was going to work at the time.

223
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,647
And they thought, OK, we'll try this.

224
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:00,855
And it was very experimental.

225
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:03,770
By the way, no one ever uses that quote when they fail.

226
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,270
OK.

227
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,060
Just want you to know.

228
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,050
That's when you get swept away, down over the waterfall.

229
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,160
And so on.

230
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,035
They were successful.

231
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,128
And they did find a model that worked.

232
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:18,633
I thought it was interesting that it wasn't-- that wasn't the outset plan.

233
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:21,216
It was just see if we can get products through and let's see--

234
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:22,257
That's a very good point.

235
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:24,420
So it when Ni Pin comes to the United States,

236
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,850
he doesn't have a master plan of conquest.

237
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,970
He gradually accumulates experience, makes good deals.

238
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,200
One leads to another.

239
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,290
He gets more experience, and still nobody knows who they are.

240
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,270
Howard?

241
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,630
I have a slight different interpretation of their US strategy,

242
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,890
in terms of why they kept the local brands.

243
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:51,060
When I read it, I kind of thought it was because of labor unions and --

244
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,560
that Wanxiang can be--

245
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,570
Labor unions and politics together, or--

246
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,379


247
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,170
I thought it was mostly labor and politics,

248
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,432
and they could make a lot of changes in the companies.

249
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:04,080
And that's why they kept them.

250
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,750
My understanding of the auto parts industry is it's pretty monetized.

251
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,646
None of us know what goes into our cars.

252
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:13,580
We don't know where the companies are from.

253
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,990
And the case also mentions how the big three just routinely tells the US

254
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,370
supplies that hey, we don't make your parts cheaper,

255
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,980
we're just going to buy from China.

256
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,180
Right, so they squeeze the parts suppliers --

257
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,880
Yeah.

258
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,595
It seems like the big three doesn't really actually care about where

259
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:36,500
their supply from as long as they satisfy the ISO --

260
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,780
As long as they are certified.

261
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,000
ISO certified.

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,358
Which, in this case, I think they are.

263
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:44,080
So at least when I saw it, I thought it was just simply

264
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,279
because they can't change.

265
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,070
They had no choice.

266
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,720
So it's not just a great strategy, but they also

267
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,344
had no choice, if they're going to succeed in acquiring these--

268
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,200
--involved as well.

269
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,740
I'm sorry?

270
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,864
Perhaps there's some politics involved, in that they can't change the name.

271
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:59,335
When they bought the company, they'd be maintaining the employees,

272
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,810
and keeping the name.

273
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,285
Do you agree with that, Aaron?

274
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:04,285
Yeah, I agree with that.

275
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:08,670
I think one of the interesting things in their M & A strategies

276
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,296
they quite also their original customs in US.

277
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:15,579
It's very typical, vertical integrated.

278
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:16,990
Right?

279
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,270
Previously, the only produced universal joint,

280
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,150
which is a relatively small parts, and then

281
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,587
later on, you have parts of a company that

282
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:30,970
can field relatively more important and more complicated

283
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,090
parts, which used to be your customer.

284
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,290
And then you get close to those big three companies.

285
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,190
So with that, there's no need to change the brand name

286
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,420
because your original brand name is on some small parts.

287
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,415
And if you change the name of those big companies,

288
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:52,985
it takes some times to explain to the big three, hey, now we are Wanxiang.

289
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:56,580
We will produce this kind of stuff.

290
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,440
It doesn't need to take this time and effort to do that.

291
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,940
OK.

292
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,565
So I think we've nailed kind of what their branding strategy is

293
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,726
and what it isn't, or has been up to now.

294
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:05,226
Henry?

295
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:08,840
I was going to say something that wasn't mentioned.

296
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,950
I think there must be a lot of good labor Council.

297
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,910
Because you're entering a foreign market.

298
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,730
Obviously the management and the thinking before that

299
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,855
would be less legalistic than operating in the US.

300
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:20,980
US market needs to be highly regulated, and there's

301
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,810
all sorts of pitfalls and potential litigation obviously.

302
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:33,100
You are acquiring a number of companies -- to pay for legal advice.

303
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,670
So you think that somehow or another, they got stealth and brilliant lawyers

304
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,325
to make all this happen without anybody knowing?

305
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:41,950
We don't know that, but I think it would've helped facilitate--

306
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,080
Then we'll find out.

307
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,470
Not yet, but we'll find out in a little bit.

308
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,647
If that's-- Ian.

309
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:49,480
I thought it was interesting how they're set up, because it's almost

310
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,620
like they're an outsourcing company, but they're

311
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,000
a Chinese company that buys American companies to help them outsource back

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,734
to China.

313
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:59,650
Or at least that's what it sounded like to me.

314
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,150
Or to upgrade technologically, the kind of things

315
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,530
that they can make in China, at Chinese prices.

316
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,030
Right.

317
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,940
Which is very interesting, because the sort of more typical thought process

318
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,530
is you have an American company that realizes it needs to reduce its costs,

319
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,537
and then will outsource to China and try to find a partner.

320
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:18,870
But I guess in some ways, this seems a little bit easier

321
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,161
because they've already got everything set up in China.

322
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,640
So when they do this, they acquire-- is a good time

323
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,590
to put your eggs in the American auto basket?

324
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,370
How is the American automobile industry doing

325
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,290
in the first decade of the 21st century?

326
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,740
The heart of the American economy.

327
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,960
It's a great moment.

328
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,445
Devin, isn't it?

329
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:45,890
-- beginning of the century -- things fall apart, like Detroit --

330
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:52,160
The number of producers of car parts and things cut in half --

331
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,660
Right.

332
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,910
So it's bad times for auto parts companies,

333
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,650
so that means it's a good opportunity potentially, for Wanxiang.

334
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,130
So that might make a lot of sense, but then

335
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,747
who is Wanxiang's market in the states?

336
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:07,992
I think we could argue that it's a bad time.

337
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:12,234
That this is pretty much what Geely did in their acquisition strategy.

338
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:16,725
When assets are distressed or undervalued, you go there

339
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:17,723
and you buy it.

340
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:21,382
And then I think there's something to be said, when you're questioning what

341
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:25,707
is their market potential-- touched on that-- I think they're not just tapping

342
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:29,699
into the assets, but they're tapping into their relationships

343
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,720
with those big companies.

344
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,110
They're getting--

345
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,190
You mean the big three?

346
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,660
Or the big American auto parts?

347
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,069
Which ones?

348
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:39,860
You're getting closer to that relationship.

349
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,232
But they're buying these companies right?

350
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,440
Under the assumption that they'll be of use to them, not just for technology.

351
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,870
Who's the market for Wanxiang America?

352
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,970
Primarily who are their American companies selling to?

353
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,840
The big three.

354
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,940
So to big three.

355
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,960
Little Chrysler, Ford, which is back.

356
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,930
General Motors.

357
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:06,250
So, what happens if the big three become the little two, or the minus one?

358
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,520
It's not inconceivable a few years ago to see

359
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,130
the collapse of the American automobile industry.

360
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,560
And in fact, you could argue one way.

361
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,890
They're investing-- and they get these assets

362
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,130
really inexpensively for a market that one assumes kind of permanently

363
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,090
will be there.

364
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,780
But it almost isn't.

365
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,874
It all depends on what's your long-term view.

366
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:29,850
Do you believe there's an export market?

367
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,814
Do you believe that the US government will

368
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:34,790
allow those industries to fall apart?

369
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,250
I think even Mr. Lu, with his long term vision,

370
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,990
probably didn't anticipate the crisis of 2008.

371
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,610
I may be wrong.

372
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,020
You're right.

373
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,480
So that would've been a big shock and a big moment, and yet they stick it out.

374
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
Do they invest in other things besides auto parts over time?

375
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,542
Yeah.

376
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:55,704
Like what?

377
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:59,550
Like golf courses.

378
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,840
Golf courses, fisheries, this is a big question.

379
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,740
This is a big question that when we've taught this at HBS,

380
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,520
the HBS students always say focus on your core competency.

381
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,130
Don't buy golf courses.

382
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,329
And there's a question which we don't know the answer to.

383
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,410
But this extraordinarily successful company,

384
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,349
which is doing so well, that it has excess cash to invest.

385
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:23,801
So it does buy things that are ancillary to its core business.

386
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:26,550
Some, and my colleague, Professor MacFarlane, the business school,

387
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,205
says reminds him of the Japanese in the 1980s doing so well.

388
00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:32,620
They bought Pebble Beach.

389
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,950
They bought Rockefeller Center.

390
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,270
Investment center that looked great at the time,

391
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,540
but turned out actually not to be so great.

392
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,520
We shall have to see.

393
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,660
But this is the Wanxiang headquarters in Chicago.

394
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,960
So it's on the one hand, under the radar.

395
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,510
On the other hand, this is a highway right out here,

396
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,770
going to O'Hare airport.

397
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,910
So it's not exactly a secret that it exists.

398
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,560
They're very active in the community.

399
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,940
Very corporately social responsibility.

400
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,620
What do you think of why this is important?

401
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,460
And this case is important.

402
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,490
It is, in many ways, a mirror of modern China.

403
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,920
1958, the first idea of Mr. Lu of starting a company.

404
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,120
The height of the Great Leap Forward.

405
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,390
'69, when they did start a company.

406
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,490
'73, when they really got going, after the three years of Julia

407
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,630
hammering these things into tractor piles.

408
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,900
You'd be so tired after this.

409
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,310
You could have finished graduate school.

410
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,410
And 1979, getting into the state plan.

411
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,620
But these are interesting years because they tell you

412
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,130
they're also reflective of political movements.

413
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,960
And open-- both closings and openings in Chinese history.

414
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,510
So now they've done this.

415
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,360
