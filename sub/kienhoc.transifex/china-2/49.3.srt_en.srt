1
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:12,360
STUDENT: Because Kunshan wasn't originally chosen

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,384
to be this favorable economic area.

3
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:16,550
So it had to develop itself.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,370
BILL KIRBY: So Kunshan was not favored?

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,407
STUDENT: It was not.

6
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:20,240
BILL KIRBY: Why not?

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,731
Why not, with this Gu Yanwu's great history, hairy crabs?

8
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:24,230
Why not?

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,850
STUDENT: Well, at the time, it was solely agricultural.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,210
So it was too small.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,515
It didn't have the advantages, the government thought.

12
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:30,140
BILL KIRBY: OK.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,080
So it wasn't chosen.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,590
Suzhou gets to have an export processing zone, Shanghai, Shenzhen, earlier.

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,610
Jasmine?

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,770
So poor Kunshan, left into the cold.

17
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,070
JASMINE: Yeah, its county government invested in its own infrastructure

18
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,494
and created its own development, which attracted

19
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:46,910
the central government eventually.

20
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,839
But it was kind of a case where the local government took the initiative.

21
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,880
BILL KIRBY: So the local government took the initiative without question.

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,208
How did they take the initiative?

23
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,200
Roseanne?

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,950
ROSEANNE: I think that part of it was that they were very open to business

25
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,489
partners, including international opportunities.

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,042
And so I guess sort of to segue around what Professor Bol is saying,

27
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:13,000
I actually think that one of the big reasons that they made a reach out

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,502
to Duke was that both of them do have a very

29
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:17,799
big history of internationalization.

30
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,590
BILL KIRBY: Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,895
They certainly both do.

32
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:21,657
Jasmine, you want to--

33
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,490
JASMINE: So the local government systems are

34
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,436
very conducive to entrepreneurship and FDI.

35
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:27,060
BILL KIRBY: OK.

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,448
JASMINE: For example, they had official liaisons to help foreign investors.

37
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:33,870
They had websites in English and Chinese,

38
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,070
which made investment information accessible.

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,100
And there was this emphasis on zero barrier, low cost, high efficiency.

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,880
So in a country where there's a lot of bureaucracy

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,059
and people typically have to go to many government officials,

42
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:49,975
the fact that they could go to just one government official in Kunshan

43
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,190
was a huge advantage.

44
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,060
BILL KIRBY: So they could make it easier.

45
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,780
So but you used this phrase.

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,705
Local government-- at least I think you did-- entrepreneurship.

47
00:01:57,705 --> 00:01:58,955
Are governments entrepreneurs?

48
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:01,590


49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,470
We've been talking about governments being

50
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,095
a problem sometimes for businesses, particularly for private businesses.

51
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:08,289
Obviously, Adrian?

52
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,030
ADRIANN: I don't know if I'd call it an entrepreneur in this case.

53
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,120
But they're definitely investors.

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,205
So they created this infrastructure that they contracted to foreign investors.

55
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:17,455
And as Jasmine was just saying, the fact that they created this infrastructure

56
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:21,280
allowed eventually in 1983 the first Japanese company to jump in.

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,030
BILL KIRBY: Right.

58
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,192
So they were an early mover in bringing in foreign-- 1983

59
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:27,150
is actually very early.

60
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,860
Emma?

61
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,050
EMMA: Their relationship with Taiwan was also hugely important.

62
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,360
BILL KIRBY: So how did they do this?

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,990
Does China have relations with Taiwan?

64
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,080


65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,420
What are Chinese political relations with Taiwan today?

66
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,200
EMMA: Currently?

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,033
BILL KIRBY: Current.

68
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,386
Currently or even back then.

69
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,330
SARA: It depends who you talk to.

70
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,790
EMMA: Pretty awkward.

71
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,440
BILL KIRBY: There are no political relations, formal political relations,

72
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,590
that is to say, between the People's Republic on the mainland

73
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,020
and the Republic of China on Taiwan.

74
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,400
And yet, there are extraordinary-- and think about it.

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,420
From 1949 really until mid 1980s, there are no relations at all.

76
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,820
There's no investment.

77
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,260
There are no telephone calls.

78
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,000
There's no mail.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,510
Taipei seems closer in the mid 1980s to Los Angeles than it does to Shanghai.

80
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,690
And this is one of the reasons why this begins to change.

81
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,300
So what kind of-- so how did they do this?

82
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,510
So they're not a special economic zone to begin with.

83
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,230
We have all these things of what they are,

84
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,159
an SEZ, an ETDZ, an EPZ, and so on.

85
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,200
They aren't these things.

86
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,310
And so what do they do?

87
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,620
How do they-- Joshua, do you remember?

88
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,712
How did they get going?

89
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:47,586
JOSHUA: They had local businessmen reach out to Taiwanese businessmen

90
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:52,250
to ask-- sort of to invite them in to trade and to invite them in to buy.

91
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,160
BILL KIRBY: They do it without any formal relationship,

92
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,030
and they make it easy for people to come and invest there.

93
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,990
That's part of it.

94
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,560
But it isn't just Taiwan.

95
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,180
If you're getting people like Taiwanese businesspeople

96
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:13,130
to come to Kunshan-- so getting foreign investment first with bicycles

97
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,940
and so on, how do you do it?

98
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,760
JONATHAN: In 1985, essentially the local government

99
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,345
unilaterally set up and ETDZ without higher approval.

100
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,590
BILL KIRBY: That's right.

101
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,240
They set up this Economic Technological Development Zone at a time-- 1985,

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,660
very close to the time when the first Special Economic Zones set up,

103
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,000
Shenzhen and others.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,750
So what's the lesson you take away from his declaring

105
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,670
an Economic and Technological Development Zone

106
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,697
without having the permission to do so?

107
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:52,113
MICHELLE: It's kind of like-- I think this was in the book

108
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:53,289
that we have to read for Wednesday.

109
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,288
But that saying, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission.

110
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:57,700
BILL KIRBY: That's right.

111
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,880
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,290
Otherwise, you miss a huge opportunity possibly for this town.

113
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,740
This is one of the fundamental lessons of business in China

114
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,400
that you must always remember.

115
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,220
Shoot first and ask permission second or ask forgiveness and not permission,

116
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,020
if need be, if it doesn't turn out so well.

117
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,020
But they move into an area where no one else is.

118
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,520
How can he do it?

119
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,350
He can do it in part because he-- does he answer-- he's within Suzhou,

120
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,080
but does he answer to Suzhou?

121
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,420


122
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,060
Not really.

123
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,410
This place is really unimportant in the early 1980s.

124
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,440
Nobody cares about Kunshan.

125
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,950
Suzhou cares about Suzhou and building up Suzhou fast.

126
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,820
It had been a great metropolis and an industrial center in the republican

127
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,500
period and a great center of learning and industry in earlier periods.

128
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,660
Shanghai, of course, the greatest metropolis.

129
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,570
Kunshan is a total backwater.

130
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,360
No-- I mean, it's got the crabs.

131
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,040
Fine.

132
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,660
But it's just about it.

133
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,240
It's a total backwater.

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,660
And so they declare an Economic and Technological Development Zone.

135
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,720
My guess is that nobody knows.

136
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,620
So what is this zone allow them to do?

137
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,480
Between Shanghai and Suzhou, what is their advantage comparatively?

138
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,980
Sara?

139
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,771
SARA: I think the fact that they're smaller

140
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:26,350
actually is an advantage in that these larger cities are not

141
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,960
going to favor the smaller investors.

142
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,990
But they're not picky about it.

143
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,020
So they'll take--

144
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,850
BILL KIRBY: They'll take anybody to start with, to be sure.

145
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,350
SARA: Yeah.

146
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,780
And they can also have more personal relationships with the investors

147
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,900
because they are smaller.

148
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,691
BILL KIRBY: So they're right on the border of the Minhang district,

149
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:45,780
for example, of Shanghai or other districts of Shanghai.

150
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,729
If you want to invest in the Minhang district

151
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,520
in Shanghai, something very large, you will

152
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,020
need to get the agreement of that district, which

153
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,120
is bigger than the size of all of Kunshan in population.

154
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,160
Then you might need several more at the city

155
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
and municipal and other government.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,500
Julia?

157
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,060
Location indeed.

158
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,490
They get the people who don't find what they want in Shanghai or Suzhou,

159
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,210
and they get the overflow from this initially.

160
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,630
But they do it also by having this-- allegedly,

161
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,390
but really seems to be true-- one chop shop.

162
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,860
It can take you 60 or 70 official stamps to get something approved,

163
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,000
which means 60 or 70 officials who need to be banqueted frequently or otherwise

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,380
taken care of.

165
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,150
Here, you just-- a couple of hairy crab banquets might-- no, I'm kidding.

166
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,219
It's really very straightforward as to-- Michael.

167
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:39,510
MICHAEL: Another advantage that Kunshan had, especially

168
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,954
compared to other neighboring cities, was their migrant policy.

169
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:43,621
BILL KIRBY: Yes.

170
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:44,120
Yes.

171
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,110
MICHAEL: Because they had a very dynamic labor

172
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,106
force that even received United Nations recognition in how great

173
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,814
it was in how it treated migrant workers.

174
00:07:51,814 --> 00:07:56,091
So let in a lot of migrant workers that had been critical to the labor force

175
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,632
but also treated them relatively well in terms of giving them

176
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:02,599
educational and health care benefits, et cetera.

177
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:03,640
BILL KIRBY: That's right.

178
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,140
So why do they need migrant workers, Michael?

179
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,015
MICHAEL: To have low cost-- to have sort of low cost labor but at the same time

180
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:16,200
have high cost labor managers from other neighboring cities.

181
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,380
So they sort of have it all.

182
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,760
BILL KIRBY: Right.

183
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,700
But they need the labor.

184
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,950
If they're going to be a center of foreign investment,

185
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,200
they don't have the labor, a sufficient labor pool right there.

186
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,450
And so they welcome-- it isn't like they're

187
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,900
inundated with migrants kind of camping out in shanties.

188
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,750
They welcome them and integrate them into their developmental strategy,

189
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,330
which as a small, effectively autonomous city,

190
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,250
even though formally under Suzhou, they can

191
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,590
do pretty much what they want in part because they're originally

192
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,730
really unimportant.

193
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,750
They can do what they want.

194
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,320
And suddenly, now they are very, very important,

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,702
and they're the model of small town success.

196
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:54,910
JACKIE: Another thing adding on that was their policy

197
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,830
of cheap land and cheap labor.

198
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,950
So you had companies wanting to import their business there and begin

199
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,014
factories and production in a place where labor and land were cheaper.

200
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:04,930
BILL KIRBY: Excellent.

201
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,190
OK.

202
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,690
Very good.

203
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,430
Jasmine?

204
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,850
JASMINE: They also had preferential policies like tax exemptions,

205
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,600
land use free concessions, and incentives

206
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,250
to encourage companies to invest.

207
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,062
