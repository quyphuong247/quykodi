Introducing Mo Yan

1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,760
My name is David Wang

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,840
I teach modern Chinese and comparative literature

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,040
at Harvard University.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,040
It is a great pleasure and honor for us to have Mr. Mo Yan

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,040
who is visiting Harvard University for the first time

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,400
many of our students have read

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
quite a number of Mo Yan's works

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,280
From "The Republic of Wine: A Novel"

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,400
to "Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out"

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,280
and indeed Mo Yan has earned his reputation

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,720
as a chronicler of Chinese life

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,160
particularly on the rural side

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,200
we all know that Mr. Mo Yan is the first Chinese winner

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,040
of the Nobel Literary Prize

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,560
and to date he has produced more than 80 short stories

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,560
more than 30 novellas, and 11 full-length novels

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,200
indeed he is quite productive and prolific

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,600
and he has won numerous awards for his

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,680
exuberant descriptions of Chinese life

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,760
for good, and for ill.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,520
Today we are very pleased to have Mr. Mo Yan here

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,000
to describe for us his experience as a writer

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,160
and the circumstances under which he undertook

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,120
the career as a writer

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,800
Mo Yan started out being a country boy

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,200
and he came from Gaomi County in Shandong province

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,080
traditionally a poor country place

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,800
and yet eventually he chose a military life

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,160
for more than 20 years

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,040
and then, starting in the early 1980's

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,160
he created a series of short stories

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,840
first describing military life and the country life

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,680
and then, he developed his own kind of magical realism

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,200
for which he has earned tremendous popularity

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,720
so we would like to invite Mr. Mo Yan

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,280
to share with us his experiences as a writer

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,520
and of course as a reader of world literature.

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,480
Mr. Mo Yan's original name is "Guǎn Móyè"

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
and yet he as adopted "Mo Yan" or in english

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,240
"no talk" or "little talk" as his pen name

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,160
so probably we will start with this question by asking Mr. Mo Yan

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,800
Why did you choose a pen name that is

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,600
the opposite of what you as a writer literally do?

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,200
That is you use "莫言" "to not speak" as your pen name,

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,360
yet your pen speaks a litany of words

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,120
that amaze and excite us in their spectacular eloquence.

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,120
In regards to my pen name...so that has become a topic huh?

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,640
With all the different debates and explanations,

49
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,440
I also find it very amusing.

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,520
At the time when I chose my pen name,

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,240
I actually didn't put that much thought into it

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,520
My original name 管謨業 (Guǎn Mò yè)

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,080
the traditional character for Mo "謨"

54
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,120
has a "言" (yán) on the left and a "莫" (mò) on the right

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,000
Split it in half and it becomes two.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
According to traditional ways of reading, we used to read

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,440
from right to left, so 莫 (Mò) 言 (yán)

58
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,160
This is the first reason

59
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,240
The second reason is

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,040
"莫言" in terms of the characters literally means "don't speak"

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,760
or speak very little

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
This might have to do with how I was brought up.

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,840
I was born in 1955

64
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,480
My childhood took place in the 1960s

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,000
At that time China had collapsed.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,560
They were engaged in class warfare

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,040
and various political movements.

68
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,000
The societal environment was really bad.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,560
A lot of people, maybe because they say one inappropriate thing

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,400
bring about a lot of trouble for themselves, for their families

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:00,400
My parents were down to earth, kind, conservative farmers

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,880
They taught me to speak little,

73
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,360
to only bring my ears when I go out.

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,600
Be cautious and careful.

75
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,480
Children, when other speaks, don't interrupt.

76
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,600
When other speaks, you listen.

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,680
Don't speak extra useless words.

78
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,800
Actually when I was little, I really liked to talk.

79
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,280
I think my parents were right to educate me this way

80
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,000
 because I liked to speak too much.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
And also my speaking had brought my family trouble,

82
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
so they treated this as a bad habit of mine,

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,160
treated this as a serious issue,

84
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,480
they constantly reminded me about it.

85
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,360
After I turned twenty

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,920
 when I picked up a pen and started to write

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,320
I felt like an author should have a pen name.

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,880
Lu Xun, Ba Jin, these famous writers,

89
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,520
even many famous writers outside of China

90
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,400
all had pen names,

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,360
shouldn't I also create a pen name?

92
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,320
So I thought to myself first, of the character in my name,

93
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,160
second of what my parents taught me,

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,760
so Mo Yan 莫言 became my pen name. Yes, Yes, Yes.

95
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,800
And now Mo Yan has become my officially used name.

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,120
Officially used name.

97
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,000
Because it was very bothersome.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,040
At the time, I couldn't receive my royalties with my pen name

99
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,920
Every time I had to go to my unit to get proof I was me

100
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,840
and have it stamped. It wasn't the 2 rmb transaction fee,

101
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,240
but I had to make the trouble of a trip

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,680
In the end I decided to change my name.

103
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,800
Now my passport, ID all say Mo Yan.
