1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,667
We'll start in-- first, Roland, do you want

2
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,250
to introduce-- we have several guests.

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,916
So we're holding a conference this week.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,230
And we've brought 42 Chinese high school students

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,580
in through a very rigorous selection process.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,250
And we have three of them here with us today.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,240
It's Carter [Zhu Hao], Nizi [Zhang  Anran], and David [Ji Shiyu].

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,350
And David's from Shanghai.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,510
Nizi is from Chengdu, and Carter's from Beijing.

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,290
And they're here to observe the class.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,680
Then also to observe this room will be the whole world

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,740
thanks to our filming of this case for ChinaX.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,656
I wanted to introduce Meghan Morrissey who

14
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:48,709
is the executive producer of ChinaX.

15
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:50,000
So Meghan, thank you very much.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,102
Thank you all for agreeing to do this.

17
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,810
Before we start, I just want to make sure

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,770
that-- totally separate from what we're going to be talking about today

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,200
but-- make sure you follow the news every day.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,246
Who was recently in Beijing?

21
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,519
Obama.

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,645
Mr. Obama, our President of the United States.

23
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:09,255
It doesn't happen every week, very interesting

24
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:15,950
set of meetings, maybe an extraordinary agreement on climate change,

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,444
bilateral climate change, fair amount of tension

26
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,984
as well, very extraordinary moment.

27
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:23,900
It seems like every year is an important year,

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,610
but this is an important year in many ways.

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,080
I was this last weekend in Berlin.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,790
What happened 25 years ago in Berlin?

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,470
The Wall.

32
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,240
The Wall came down in Berlin.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,670
It actually didn't come down.

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,430
People got through the Wall, then they tore it down,

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,090
and they sold pieces of it.

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,840
You can still buy pieces of the Berlin Wall today.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,145
I mean they'll make more if you needed it, probably made in China.

38
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,640
But anyway, you can buy it.

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,580
And it's a very interesting-- think of 1989

40
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,806
and how moments in history that really matter over time.

41
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:05,625
You have the 25th anniversary not celebrated in Beijing, 1989.

42
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:11,810
A 25th anniversary robustly celebrated in Germany, 1989.

43
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,810
And apparently, a very hot video by Taylor

44
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,460
Swift having nothing to do, naturally, with any of this.

45
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:24,110
It just happens to be in this usual rock center, self-centeredness,

46
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,740
just the year she happened to be born.

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,720
In any event, we won't talk about Taylor Swift.

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,284
Let's talk about a company, and let's start with this case,

49
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:38,450
and we're going to do this one through these slides.

50
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,160
I want to use the case of Wanxiang to talk about how these cases are done.

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,864
What makes for a Harvard Business School case,

52
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:51,810
and how do we come across-- how do we decide to do them?

53
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,870
We haven't yet really looked, in a fundamental way,

54
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,650
at a Chinese international enterprise.

55
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,450
And that's what we do today in the case of Wanxiang,

56
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,907
and it's a great pleasure to welcome, and indeed

57
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:06,490
welcome back to the Harvard Business School, Mr. Ni Pin, who's

58
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,000
the president of Wanxiang America in Chicago.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,880


60
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,210
Thank you, very much, for joining us.

61
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:23,040
And we'll have at least a half an hour with Ni Pin at the end of the class.

62
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:32,660
So let's get started with, seems to me, a relatively simple question

63
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,340
that one can ask about this firm, which we

64
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,580
tend to ask about almost every company when we come into it.

65
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,750
How many of you have heard of Wanxiang before opening your books?

66
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,120
OK.

67
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,030
So let's see, Henry, how have you heard of Wanxiang?

68
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,012
I just heard that it was one of the few Chinese companies

69
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,570
that had undertaken a successful and high profile

70
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,790
acquisition of a series of major US assets.

71
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,910
OK.

72
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,750
How many of you had never heard of Wanxiang before this case?

73
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,230
Wow!

74
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,436
So that's pretty impressive, it seems to me,

75
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:10,560
because it is one of the most successful Chinese companies in this country,

76
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,710
but it's also one of most successful Chinese companies in China.

77
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,210
But Eric, you have heard of Wanxiang, and how have you heard of Wanxiang?

78
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,295
They were in the news last year for acquiring A123.

79
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:25,360
They were in-- They were, actually, if you guys actually read the news.

80
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,130
Do you ever read the newspaper?

81
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,880
It's a thing that comes in the morning.

82
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,930
You open it up, or you can get it online, I'm told.

83
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,840
But New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, but they

84
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,330
were big in the story about an American acquisition

85
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,040
actually right here in the Boston area.

86
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,450
In Waltham, Massachusetts, Watch City-- if you go through Waltham

87
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,912
today, it's called-- There is Watch City Brewery.

88
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:52,870
They used to make-- about half of the watches made in the United States

89
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,930
were made in Waltham, Massachusetts in plants

90
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,900
powered in part by the mighty Charles River that

91
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,580
dribbles through there today.

92
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,800
And who else had heard?

93
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,300
All right.

94
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,906
Yasu, how had you heard?

95
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,592
I was doing business with Wanxiang.

96
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:09,175
You were doing business with Wanxiang.

97
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:09,675
Yes.

98
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:13,078
Were they easy to do business with?

99
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,539
It was a good experience for me.

100
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,487
Good experience, OK.

101
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:17,948
Well, yeah, I did.

102
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:20,570
I was doing a finance business, and Wanxiang

103
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,400
has the Wanxiang auxilary finance companies.

104
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,750
So we're talking about the cooperation in that business in Hangzhou

105
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,560
In Hangzhou very good.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,091
Zack, you've heard of Wanxiang.

107
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:36,590
Yeah.

108
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,882
How have you heard of Wanxiang?

109
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:40,173
My dad actually does a little bit of business in China,

110
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,820
so he's spoken a lot about Wanxiang.

111
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,549
So your dad does business in China, and what kind of business does your dad do?

112
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,090
He works for a company called Henkel.

113
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,840
Henkel, OK.

114
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,340
It's an adhesive company.

115
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,160
They're like global, but he's actually been to China before.

116
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,450
And what does Henkel do?

117
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,910
They produce adhesives for industry, especially actually automotive parts.

118
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,930
Automotive parts.

119
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,486
I'm sure that's probably why I

120
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,236
have heard of them

121
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,320
So you had heard of Wanxiang.

122
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,680
Anybody else?

123
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,100
I thought I saw another hand.

124
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,805
No.

125
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:12,380
So no one has heard of Wanxiang before this.

126
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,050
It's not surprising.

127
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,470
Any of you drive a car?

128
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,123
Josh, do you drive a car?

129
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:19,665
Have you driven a car?

130
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:20,460
Yes.

131
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,900
I have driven my mom's car.

132
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
And what does your mom--

133
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,750
A Subaru.

134
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,750
A Subaru.

135
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,030
It depends on where it's produced and so on.

136
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,975
Probably no Wanxiang parts in that particular one.

137
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,229
Who else?

138
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,650
I haven't driven since high school, but I drove an Acura.

139
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,930
An Acura.

140
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,170
Anybody drive an American car anymore?

141
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,040
No American cars?

142
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,750
Yes, I drove a Jeep--

143
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,250
A Jeep!

144
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,625
--actually, it was Chrysler made.

145
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:52,070
Chrysler made, so big three, kind of the mini me of the big three,

146
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,220
but nevertheless, one of the major American auto parts.

147
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,340
Very likely some serious parts made by Wanxiang.

148
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,740
Would it bother you to know that?

149
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,150
Probably not.

150
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,940
I mean, it seems like they emphasize quality a lot.

151
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,180
Is your Jeep OK?

152
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,710
It has worked pretty well.

153
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,817
Typical Chrysler product, pretty well.

154
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:18,650
How about you Derek.

155
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,220
Have you ever heard of Wanxiang?

156
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,510
I have not.

157
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,420
Never heard of Wanxiang.

158
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,850
Does it bother you that half of your car might be made by them,

159
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,540
and you have no idea who they are 'til this case?

160
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,910
It doesn't bother you?

161
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,290
Maybe, I don't know.

162
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:35,790
Julia?

163
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,958
It was a Pontiac.

164
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:37,458
American?

165
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,450
Pontiac, yes!

166
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,900
Somebody drives a Pontiac.

167
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,120
It's dead that brand, but never the mind.

168
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,150
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

169
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,240
So would it bother you or would you feel pleased to know

170
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,036
that Wanxiang might have made your breaks?

171
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:51,964
I don't know.

172
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:54,590
I don't know how I would feel, because there

173
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,940
is this controversy over the quality of Chinese produced goods,

174
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,185
but being a Chinese person--

175
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:02,510
Some people say that there's a controversy, but you had no idea.

176
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,600
Did the brakes work?

177
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,160
Yeah.

178
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,440
So there.

179
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,040
The last Pontiac on Earth, you heard it here.

180
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,360
What model year, do you know?

181
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,300
I don't know it was a Pontiac Sunfire.

182
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,694
Pontiac Sunfire, it's not new.

183
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:16,360
That's for sure.

184
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,390


185
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,890
Hannah?

186
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,450
A Jeep, good for you.

187
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,410
Well, when we get to Beijing Jeep, in that case,

188
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,091
but the Jeep-- So who makes Jeep?

189
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,350
I think it's the US.

190
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,010
Yes.

191
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,130
Yes, and as we'll see, China.

192
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,189
And you remember what company?

193
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:37,070
No.

194
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,900
No.

195
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,919
Two companies actually, first, American Motors and then Chrysler,

196
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,994
and both of them had the great honor of going bankrupt.

197
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,410
Chrysler is now out of bankruptcy.

198
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,100
AMC is dead.

199
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,390
But it's probably a Chrysler Jeep that you had.

200
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,598
But it's certainly possible that some of the parts would be made by Wanxiang.

201
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:57,990
The questions that one would say if one thinks about,

202
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,330
why you write a case on Wanxiang?

203
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,072
And if we could start with why Wanxiang?

204
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:06,280
Why would I have decided to write a case on Wanxiang?

205
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,250


206
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,490
Just boredom.

207
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,960
I actually like cars, so that's-- but that's not why I did it.

208
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,419
