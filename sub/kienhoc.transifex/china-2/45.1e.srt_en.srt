1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,390
1992, in some sense, Deng's is a career of so many ups and downs,

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,170
and in some sense, at least in terms of the international reaction

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,380
to 1989, and to some degree the domestic one economically,

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,940
is one of further retrenchment, some very significant outrage

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,020
internationally.

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,845
But in some sense, if he has a second large chance in 1978,

7
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:38,100
he has a third chance in 1992 to make his mark on the country.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,280
Why is that date so important and still, not only remembered today, but emulated

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,980
by every Chinese leader thereafter?

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,380
In the summer of 1988, Deng felt that before he retired,

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,790
he ought to allow prices to be decontrolled, and so he took that step.

12
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,870
And then inflation took off and people were extremely unhappy.

13
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,290
Then at the end of the year, conservatives

14
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,070
got control of the economy.

15
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,420
Inflation had been too wild, and so everything

16
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,060
was restrained growth, don't have risk.

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,200
One of the reasons there were so many people supporting the students in '89

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,790
was not because they knew anything about democracy

19
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,970
but because they were concerned about inflation,

20
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,820
and then they were concerned about the very tight money policy.

21
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,970
So '91, '92, they continued the very tight money policy.

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,930
Of course, foreign sanctions had slowed down the economic growth,

23
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,350
and Deng believed that if they didn't begin to grow faster again,

24
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,150
there could be real chaos in the country,

25
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,360
that there could be a real revolution and people could go wild.

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,050
And so he tried to encourage them to do that.

27
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,660
He went to Shanghai in the summer of '91 and tried to encourage that,

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,010
but it didn't take.

29
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,040
He didn't have a formal position at that time.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,410
It was just a retired old man-- something

31
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,887
I can identify with-- a retired old man saying, look,

32
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:11,970
things aren't going right.

33
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,520
We've got do something about it.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,020
And so he decided he would take a family vacation.

35
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,250
If he had announced that he was going south to urge people

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,560
to speed up reforms it wouldn't have happened,

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,415
but he said he was going on family vacation.

38
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:28,710
Who could object to that?

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,850
So his family did indeed go on a vacation.

40
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,530
They stopped at a few places.

41
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,270
In the very first place they stopped at, Wuhan,

42
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,330
he said if people don't believe in reform and opening

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,910
and aren't pushing it, they ought to step down off the stage.

44
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,300
People knew that meant he was stirring up opposition.

45
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,810
Perhaps some of the army would stand by him.

46
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,330
But he was smart enough then to head for Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai,

47
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,220
where he knew people wanted to move ahead,

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,420
where they wanted to have more market reforms,

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,840
and where they would be eager to push ahead.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,220
So he went down to those places, and when

51
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,940
he arrived for this family vacation, reporters had gotten word,

52
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,910
and also reporters in Hong Kong got the word.

53
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,910
So although you couldn't report his trip inside China,

54
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,330
the Hong Kong press and television was reporting it

55
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,355
and it was seeping across the border to all kinds of people.

56
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:27,700
The broadcasts from Hong Kong can seep in all over southern China.

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,190
So people were getting wise and there was beginning to be popular support.

58
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,440
Within a week or two, Jiang Zemin, who was the new head,

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,800
said he thought that Deng was going to have his way

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,670
and that he was on trial to see if he was going to bring reform or opening

61
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,770
and continue or whether he was one of those who ought to step down.

62
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,730
And he decided to follow Deng's pattern, and within a couple weeks,

63
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,030
people in the south who wanted more reform and wider opening

64
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,860
were delighted.

65
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,540
Things were beginning to happen.

66
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,850
The same kind of wide open policies and the wide open strategy

67
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,800
was working again, and so Deng took off.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,890
Of course, it led to a little inflation that somebody, Zhu Rongji,

69
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,980
had to come in and bring down in the next several years,

70
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,730
but they were able to do it in a way this time there was a soft landing.

71
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,300
So in a way, his legacy in 1992 was to get the economy back

72
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,220
on this rapid growth strategy, and it worked.

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,525
Last question, Ezra.

74
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:38,900
China has had many dominant leaders over the course of the 20th century--

75
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:45,450
Yuan Shikai, Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, Chiang Kai-shek again

76
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,970
on Taiwan, Chiang Ching-kuo.

77
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,080
How do you rate Deng Xiaoping?

78
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,100
First of all, I would say a lot of them had in common

79
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,850
that they wanted to modernize China.

80
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,620
A lot of the things that Deng wanted to do is something that they shared,

81
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,320
and they had a similar vision, but Deng was the only one who really succeeded.

82
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,240
He was the one who was able to enrich the Chinese people

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,220
and to strengthen the nation.

84
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,860
Not only did he turn China around, but he

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,720
helped China rise to where they are influential in the world.

86
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,950
If you say, which leader of the world in the 20th century

87
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,570
really changed the course of history?

88
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,400
You're a historian, I'm not, but I've lived 50 years of research

89
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,305
and I've seen that much of history, that nobody has had the impact on the world

90
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,760
that Deng did-- raising several hundred million people above the poverty line,

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,360
bringing back an ancient civilization to the first time where it was not only

92
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
a power in the region but taking part in the world activities

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,370
and accepting world norms, joining World Trade Organization,

94
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,330
taking part in other international organizations,

95
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,690
and then being so influential that it's one of the two dominant powers

96
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,790
in the world today.

97
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,760
It was Deng Xiaoping who did that.

98
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,820
And I think in Chinese history, maybe one or two

99
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,040
other leaders could rank with that kind of accomplishment.

100
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,750
Of course, it wasn't just one person who did this.

101
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,160
He had to have a lot of other people who realized that changes were needed

102
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,680
and they cooperated and had the ability.

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,510
It depended on Mao Zedong having unified the country.

104
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,550
If the country weren't unified, he wouldn't

105
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,150
have been able to do those things.

106
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,370
But to take it from a country that was absolute mess, chaos, practically

107
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,910
civil war to putting it on the path to modernization,

108
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,820
it was an extraordinary accomplishment, and having

109
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,990
the wisdom to manage that political process was unusual.

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,610
I've been amazed in going through the minutes

111
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,590
of the meetings with foreign leaders how much he knew about the world.

112
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,040
This was an extraordinarily well informed person.

113
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,100
He could spontaneously, given our lecture

114
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,690
on Vietnam political economic history, or Russia, or the United States,

115
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,380
of course China, he had met the leaders of the world.

116
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,700
He was extraordinarily well informed and thoughtful and strategic.

117
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,750
He was not a micromanager, but he had the big picture

118
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,620
and he led the great ancient civilization into the modern world.

119
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,160
Ezra Vogel, thank you very, very much indeed.

120
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,660
Welcome.

121
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,243
Ganxie ganxie.

122
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:29,210
Buyong xie, buyong xie.

123
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,118
