[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:09,130


3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,700
If world history is any guide, there is no automatic connection

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,230
between economic integration on the one hand

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,820
and political partnership on the other.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,220
Think of the unification of other countries.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,600
Germany established a customs union in the decades

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,120
before its unification in 1870.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,810
But it was iron and blood, not trade, that defined Bismarck's Reich.

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,260
Italy united without any pretense to economic solidarity

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,630
among its different parts.

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,570
Europe was well integrated economically in the years

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,260
before its unimaginable fratricide in World War I. In the 1980s,

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,110
East Germany became economically dependent on West Germany,

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,450
but it collapsed and it was absorbed politically

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,360
because its rulers lost their political will

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,709
and their international protectorate.

18
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,200
In China's own much longer history, there

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,260
are many examples of empires founded by political ambition

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,920
and military conquest, which then enforced economic unity.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,180
Think of the first emperor of Qin, who unified weights and measures,

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,300
or Mao Zedong with his people's coming.

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,900
But no Chinese empire was ever unified because of trade and commerce.

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,470


25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,540
What does the Hong Kong model tell us?

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,600
Hong Kong became more integrated economically

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,110
with China in the years before its political reconnection.

28
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,510
Hong Kong businesspeople recognized earlier than anyone

29
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,710
else the great potential of the Chinese economy in the Deng Xiaoping era.

30
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,040
They understood better than anyone else that Hong Kong's political future

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,640
was ultimately China's to decide.

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,380
Economics, however, did not dictate politics.

33
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:06,790
Investment flowed before and would have flowed without political reunification.

34
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,900
And no matter what the economic relations, political reunion

35
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:17,670
was inevitable and would have occurred under any Chinese government.

36
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,640
Taiwan, as we have seen, followed Hong Kong

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,850
in doing business in China in a big way.

38
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,500
70% or more of the firms surveyed by Taiwan's economics ministry

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,380
admit to making investments on the mainland.

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,820
This makes business sense for small and medium sized enterprises, many of which

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,250
relocate sunset industries to China.

42
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,530
And it makes sense from larger industrial combines,

43
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,270
such as Formosa Plastics, not to mention for the localities in China

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,020
that receive these investments.

45
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,790
At the same time, there were growing cultural connections across the strait.

46
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,460
Taiwanese and Fujianese may worship the same deities, swoon at the same rock

47
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:11,770
stars, and even get married one to another, sometimes more than once.

48
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,890
But these commonalities have nothing automatically

49
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,180
to do with the prospects for political unity.

50
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,640
Unlike Hong Kong before 1997, Taiwan is politically autonomous.

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,320
Unlike Hong Kong, Taiwan has an army, a navy, an air force,

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,350
even if the balance of forces are shifting in the mainland's favor.

53
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,910
Unlike Hong Kong, Taiwan has strong political parties, each one of which

54
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,210
is committed to maintain Taiwan's autonomy.

55
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,840
In short, in Taiwan, there is no compelling economic reason

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,670
and no political constituency for political unification

57
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,170
with the People's Republic of China.

58
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,030


59
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,890
While Beijing insists that Taiwan be part of one China,

60
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,970
China's enticement of Taiwanese investment

61
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,510
shows that economic cooperation is very possible without political relations

62
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,250
of any sort.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,649
Indeed, it may be that the lack of formal political ties,

64
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,250
and until very recently direct transportation links,

65
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,830
has been a push factor for Taiwan industries to relocate to the mainland,

66
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,580
to be nearer their customers and their work forces,

67
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,280
and to cement good relations with the legions of local Chinese authorities

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,210
that welcome investment from Taiwan.

69
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,370
Better political relations do not automatically mean more trade.

70
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,660
Taiwan's exports to the mainland plunged in the first period of President Ma's

71
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,690
presidency, but that was because of the global financial crisis

72
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,780
that neither side of the Taiwan Strait anticipated.

73
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:02,680
If political relations across the Taiwan Strait were ever fully normalized,

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,425
think of it.

75
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:07,840
There might actually be less incentive for Taiwan businesses,

76
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,560
particularly in high tech industries, to expand to or relocate to the mainland.

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,480
After all, Taipei is geographically closer to the largest Chinese markets

78
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,620
than is Beijing, and if one can do business in China from a Taiwan base,

79
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,480
enjoying Taiwan's political system and Taiwan's legal system,

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,020
having all the advantages of being able to invest in the Chinese mainland

81
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,740
from Taiwan, why not?

82
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,450
In the long run, of course cross-strait trade

83
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,900
will likely benefit via normalization of political relations.

84
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,560
But economics alone will not determine political outcomes.

85
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,570
Even in an age of economic interpenetration,

86
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,350
governments are much more than economic actors.

87
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,290
For the rulers of governments, there are almost always

88
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,590
higher priorities, not the least of which is their own political survival.

89
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,230
That was true of Chiang Kai-Shek and Mao Zedong and of their many successors.

90
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,670
Whatever the future political relationship

91
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,380
between Taiwan and the mainland, it will be decided by statesmen, not

92
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,040
by businessmen.

93
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:27,712
