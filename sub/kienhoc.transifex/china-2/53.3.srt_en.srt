[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,300


3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,790
If we think of a distinguishing feature of China today,

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,870
it is that of the Chinese infrastructure state.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,550
And nothing has been more consistent and sustained in the past 30,

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,980
35 years than the massive investment in Chinese infrastructure.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,160
The plans, we know, date back to Sun Yat-sen.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,650
Sun Yat-sen we've met before.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,330
You remember that he is the father of the modern infrastructure state.

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,560
These are his plans for the proposed railway system of 1921,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,990
and these are the plans of China's proposed railways for 2020.

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,150
Still haven't quite caught up with all that Dr. Sun had set out in his plans.

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,820
And yet the Chinese government today is even more ambitious

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,850
than Sun Yat-sen in the sense that even he never

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,180
thought, as this map shows, of a railway from mainland China to Taiwan.

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,290
But it is on Chinese plans today.

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,680
I don't know if they've told our friend Ma Ying-jeou about this.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,995
China today is an infrastructure state, as we

19
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,070
have seen, unleashed and unchecked.

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,560
This is an investment that continues with evermore ambitious projects.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,610
High-speed rail that is the envy of the world, certainly

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,960
the envy of me when I take American trains.

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,240
China has recently opened the world's longest high-speed rail line

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,020
from Beijing to Guangzhou, airports the likes of which

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,350
we will never see in our lifetimes in this country.

26
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,810
There are 45 airports planned for the next five years.

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,540
Beijing is rumored to be planning yet another large airport, the world's

28
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,350
largest that will be the size, it is said, of Bermuda.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,660
Here's the Beijing subway system in 2003,

30
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,530
the Beijing subway system in 2008, the Beijing subway system in 2013.

31
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,660
Here in Boston, you'll remember, we have a plan

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,680
to add about four miles to what we call the Green Line.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,150
This is our big infrastructure project, 4 miles of a 19th-century trolley line,

34
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,250
and it probably won't be built.

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,770
The longest sea bridge in the world over Qingdao Bay, they're in China.

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,920
A network of roads extending across the empire, in this case from Turpan

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,050
to Urumqi.

38
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,350
Infrastructure and telecommunications, China Mobile,

39
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,060
make sure that people in Kashgar get to watch the Olympics in 2008,

40
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,660
whether they want to or not.

41
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,380
To test this infrastructure state, I went to the farthest place in the realm

42
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,850
that I could find, Lhasa, the most distant place, the highest place,

43
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,690
to see if my cell phone would work there.

44
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,570
My wife called me up from the Great Wall on the other side of the empire.

45
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,510
And I figured probably my phone won't work in Lhasa, too high, too far away,

46
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,940
or maybe for political reasons.

47
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,660
But no problem, no problem whatsoever.

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,110
This is an infrastructure state that works, as the Three Gorges Dam, first

49
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,490
proposed by Sun Yat-sen, worked on under the regimes of Chiang Kai-Shek and Mao

50
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,890
Zedong, and built by Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao's, governments, the largest

51
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,670
hydroelectric and water management project in world history.

52
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,350
So if one thinks of infrastructure, there's no question, can China lead?

53
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,350
China is leading.

54
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,110
China does lead.

55
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,870
This infrastructure state allowed a place like Chongqing

56
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,360
to become a Manhattan on the Yangtze even though 1,500 miles upriver

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,420
from Shanghai.

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,840
And you know that Chongqing is a Manhattan on the Yangtze

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,673
if you look at this building because the characters on the left side

60
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:39,060
of the building say New York, New York.

61
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,040
And the building is kind of shaped a bit like the Chrysler Building in New York.

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,885
And it oversees Liberation Square.

63
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:49,510
And this is the Liberation Monument in Liberation Square

64
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,060
in downtown Chongqing, a monument put up by Chiang Kai-Shek

65
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,360
to celebrate liberation from the Japanese,

66
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,200
a monument that was renamed People's Liberation Monument by Mao Zedong

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,640
to celebrate liberation from Chiang Kai-Shek.

68
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,170
In their days, however, there was not a Rolex clock

69
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,810
on the top of the Liberation Monument as there is today.

70
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,830
And if you go to the Liberation Monument and to Liberation Square,

71
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,329
I can guarantee you that you'll be liberated from your money

72
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:26,650
by international stores such as this or by great Chinese emporia such as this,

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,270
a place of consumption without parallel, certainly in all of Western China

74
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,684
and a place of extraordinary entrepreneurship.

75
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,350
Still, at the end, there will be limits.

76
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,280
There would have to be limits to the number of roads, railroads, airports,

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,220
electric lines and amount of telecommunication bandwidth

78
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,640
that can be delivered.

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,040
This engine will likely begin to run out of steam

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,600
as the current migration from country to city begins to slow.

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,680
In the next 20 years, however, there will be new needs

82
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,000
as the population living in cities passes 60% and then 70%,

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,860
and as roads expand to support the cars that an anticipated production

84
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,540
rate of 32 million units per year will bring.

85
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,440
But the bottom line on infrastructure is this.

86
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,760
Not only can China lead, China is already

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,110
leading the world in infrastructure.

88
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:29,579
