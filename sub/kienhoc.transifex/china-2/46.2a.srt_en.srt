1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:19,260
Post '49, the decision is first to give what?

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,860
What happens first to farmers post '49?

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,380
Sachin?

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,440
Mao basically takes land from his landlords

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,567
and redistributes it to farming families,

6
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:30,775
and they the set up these things called cooperatives,

7
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,390
and then ultimately collectives.

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,560
So he basically makes it more equal.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,490
So initially, he does in some degree what

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,980
Sun Yat-sen had offered to do, redistribute the land,

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,030
make it more equal.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,400
He also kills millions of landowners-- small, big, medium, mostly small--

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,350
in order to show the power of this new state.

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,790
So there's a terror and a distribution of land.

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,906
Jasmine?

16
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:59,552
With the larger collectives, as Sachin said,

17
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:01,670
there was a collapse of the cultural connectivity

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,775
because individual farmers no longer had incentives

19
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:09,540
to produce because everything that they produced had to go to the state.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,110
OK.

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,400
So you have this short period of time when farmers are actually

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,900
given the rights to own their own their land, the property rights, and then

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,840
all these rights go into what are called collectives,

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:32,430
and then eventually into what are called people's communes by 1958.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,540
So who owns the land in this context?

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,040
Jake?

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,890
The state.

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,595
The state.

29
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:39,530
The government.

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,990
Local governments or collectives in principle, but the state owns the land.

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,060
And I think it's fair to say from this period on, no group in China

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,780
has been more disadvantaged-- it's one of the great tragedies-- been

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,160
more disadvantaged in this revolution from the beginning of it,

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,400
probably even until today than farmers because they lose the most

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,690
valuable resource that there is historically in China, which is land.

36
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,720
They lose right to the land that they farm,

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:20,640
and it's an issue that is in some sense still with us today.

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,717
So Julia had a point about collectives.

39
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:25,050
Are collectives an improvement, at least more efficient,

40
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,540
than small, medium sized farming?

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,710
No, she says.

42
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,051
Do you agree?

43
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:30,550
Disagree?

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,211
Sara?

45
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:31,710
Yeah.

46
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,690
I do agree.

47
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,720
I think someone mentioned this already, but small farmers

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,200
are more incentivized to produce at the highest level,

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,260
and the government, it even says in the case,

50
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,361
is not even investing in these agricultural communes.

51
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,110
They're putting the money into the cities,

52
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,380
and the money's being lost in the market.

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,340
Right.

54
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,760
And if you remember in the-- Jackie, please.

55
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,800
I think another issue that arose was the competitive patriotism.

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,830
So as each area was supposed to produce a quota of food, the competition

57
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,160
to be more patriotic and produce more food

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,470
and be more abiding by the revolution ultimately,

59
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,260
when people weren't able to produce the amount that they said that they were,

60
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,350
there were shortages leading to mis-distribution of food and famine.

61
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,600
Right.

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,305
The state has always had a huge interest in the regulation of agriculture.

63
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:32,260
It's one of the fundamental principles of Chinese government

64
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,385
from the beginning of this.

65
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:36,830
And with the idea, you remember, that farmers

66
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,540
are the most valued part of society, even though, in fact,

67
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,290
that historically hasn't been the case.

68
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:50,030
In the PRC, farming is to be, first of all, one is to march into socialism,

69
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,800
so private property disappears, particularly in the countryside.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,870
It disappears in the countryside.

71
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,420
We've already seen that all private businesses in urban areas

72
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,870
are socialized by 1956.

73
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,290
Farms are even ahead of the game in that, but certainly all

74
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,540
collectivized by 1955, 1956, and then communized

75
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,040
in much larger areas, the idea being a larger

76
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,730
area might be more efficient in 1958 and 1959 under the Great Leap Forward,

77
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,140
and incentivized, really politically incentivized by this incredibly

78
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,690
powerful state to produce, and in many cases

79
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,960
to overproduce in their late '50s and early '60s,

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,150
and to do many other things.

81
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,250
And what is the result of this?

82
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,210
What happens?

83
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,960
The Great Famine.

84
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,210
The Great Famine.

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,100
The greatest famine in all of Chinese history, the long history that we've

86
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,310
studied, but by far the largest occurs in the early 1960s

87
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,592
as a result of these agricultural policies.

88
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:52,300
Somewhere no less than 30 million people,

89
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,950
but probably the best estimates are closer to 50 or 55 million people

90
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,120
perish during the Great Leap Forward Famine,

91
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,485
so it is a disaster, a catastrophe.

92
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:08,880


93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,760
There's a debate in whether it's a-- the weather isn't great,

94
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,120
but it's not really three bad years.

95
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,370
It's a man-made famine.

96
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,400
It's really a Mao made famine.

97
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,980
Julia?

98
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,240
And this is a period in which people could not meet their state quotas,

99
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,980
and yet in this period, one of the tragedies

100
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,630
is that the government, to meet its international obligations

101
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,600
to its socialist brothers, is still exporting food

102
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,174
to pay for Soviet and East European imports.

103
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:39,840
Jasmine, please.

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,920
I feel like a lot of it was an inability for the CCP

105
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,133
to admit that Mao could have been wrong in this collectivization campaign.

106
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:53,545
Right, or Mao himself, because there was a courageous defense minister, Peng

107
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:56,385
Dehuai, who challenged this and was purged as a result.

108
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:57,650
The Lushan conference.

109
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,400
At the Lushan conference, you'll remember.

110
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,810
So because Mao was unable to admit that he himself was wrong and the CCP

111
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,760
was unwilling to show that he might have been wrong,

112
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,890
they would take food that the farmers would actually need for eating

113
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,280
and give it to the state.

114
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,210
Now, that's right.

115
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,720
It's actually highly differentiated across China as to which places.

116
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,430
It has a lot to do with the capacity and strength

117
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,180
and political, ideological loyalty of certain parties, cadres

118
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,010
in different provinces that have either better

119
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,160
or catastrophic outcomes for people.

120
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,510
And so if you're a farmer, Joe.

121
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,680
You're in Ningxia.

122
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,676
It's a very poor area, and you want to leave Ningxia,

123
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:47,800
you want to sell your land.

124
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,425
What do you do?

125
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:49,600
Can you leave?

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,920
You can't leave because they've put a tax on you,

127
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,010
and then if you go to the cities, you don't get any benefits.

128
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,000
They made it so you were basically tied to your land.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,980
It is a form of serfdom in a way that is as great in legal and economic terms

130
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,970
as Russian serfdom in late Imperial Russia

131
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,610
or in Prussia, Poland, and Eastern Europe, but in many ways

132
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,740
a shorter period to be sure, but people tied to the land.

133
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,460
Today, people move around.

134
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,340
Even though their household registration, or their hukou,

135
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,390
may be a rural one, people can move around.

136
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,774
But in the Maoist period, if you wanted to leave Ningxia,

137
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:36,690
how would you get out?

138
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,610


139
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,130
Actually, there aren't the roads, or railroads, or airplanes.

140
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,690
It's not that easy to just walk out of Ningxia.

141
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,960
You can be stopped on the few roads that there would have been.

142
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,490
But you stay in situ, and this is part of the great tragedy of the Great Leap

143
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,060
Forward.

144
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,780
People starved in place.

145
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,950
They were legally and physically frozen in place

146
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:11,400
and had no capacity to go where food was in that context.

147
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,078
