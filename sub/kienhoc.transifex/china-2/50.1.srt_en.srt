[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:25,360


3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,220
Lake Tai, Taihu, lies 80 miles west of Shanghai in Jiangsu province.

4
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,940
For centuries, its tree-lined shores have drawn painters, poets,

5
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,760
and scholars from throughout the realm.

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,770
Its clear waters, laden with fish and white shrimp,

7
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,410
have attracted fishermen from across the Yangzi River Delta.

8
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,350
Lake Tai has enjoyed a rich and long history

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,640
at the center of China's cultural and economic heartland.

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,420
Today this same region is, by most standards, booming.

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,696
It's the leading site of economic growth and industrial development

12
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:06,640
that has gripped China now for the last 35 years.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,810
Wuxi-- a heavily industrialized city of over 6 million people

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,230
on Taihu's northern shore.

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,080
Wuxi boasts a growing skyline, modern bridges, elevated highways,

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,050
and a per capita GDP of over US $17,000-- very high

17
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,060
by Chinese standards.

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,650
Based on all the standard development indicators, including literacy, income,

19
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,220
and mortality, the quality of life in this area

20
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,870
is better than it has ever been.

21
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,380
But Lake Tai is dying.

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,830
The shores of Taihu are now lined with thousands of chemical factories, 2,800

23
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,360
of them in the Wuxi area alone in 2007.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,740
Its waters are polluted beyond recognition.

25
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,640
And the transparent brightness of which the poet Fan Chengda wrote

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,720
has given way to a neon green layer of toxic cyanobacteria--

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,150
that is, pond scum, chemical pond scum.

28
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,010
The source of Wuxi's tap water, not to mention regional fisheries,

29
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,610
is in danger of extinction.

30
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,920
Perhaps only its famous limestone rock industry-- you know,

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,980
those crag boulders notable in Chinese gardens, shaped under Taihu's waters--

32
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,420
perhaps this industry will benefit from the fact

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,255
that maybe now these rocks will arose much more rapidly in this degraded lake

34
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,380
than they would have before.

35
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,250
Once a symbol of beauty, Lake Tai exemplifies

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,400
the environmental sacrifices that China has

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,880
made for the sake of sustained industrialization and development.

38
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,600
The water is green.

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,300
The air is noxious.

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,420
Soil erosion is severe.

41
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,740
These are among the environmental consequences

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,210
of China's post-1978 reforms, which threatened

43
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,560
not only the natural environment, but also the social and economic stability

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,830
of the country.

45
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,690
These dangers are perhaps greater in China than anywhere else,

46
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,580
in part because China has such a long history of environmental degradation.

47
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,853
