00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:17,950


3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,310
BILL KIRBY: So welcome to Kunshan Duke Daxue, Duke Kunshan University.

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,190
And here we are at DKU in its final months of construction

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,650
in the middle of Kunshan in the middle of Jiangsu provence.

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,360
And I'm here with Dr. Mary Brown Bullock,

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,610
who's the executive vice chancellor for Duke Kunshan University.

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,835
And Mary thank you very much for welcoming us.

9
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:43,960
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: Well, thank you for being here.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,597
This is you fourth, fifth, sixth time?

11
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:47,180
BILL KIRBY: I've been here many times.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,120
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: Many times, right.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,120
So you've seen these building grown.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,911
BILL KIRBY: I've seen these buildings grow.

15
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:55,400
And I've seen grow here-- and I've never imagined quite frankly it

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,380
would be as beautiful as it is, this main academic building.

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,260
But we're in the middle of the most ambitious American effort

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,800
in higher education in China, since the building

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,860
of the Yenching University in the late 1920s, a university that

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,880
would have an enormous impact on China in the Republican period and then

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,270
still today as the campus of Peking University.

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,381
So Mary tell us what's behind us and what's going on.

23
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,130
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: Well, as Bill said, we

24
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,080
are in the final months of construction Duke Kunshan University.

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,440
We will open in August for our first classes.

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,070
BILL KIRBY: Of 2014, so this may be aired after that.

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,990
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: 2014, and the building behind you

28
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,170
is the centerpiece of the campus.

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,000
We call it the academic building.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,843
You can see that it has-- I don't know if you can pick up

31
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:51,100
the fine glass edging, but it has some elements from Suzhou Gardens,

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,380
as well as having a very distinct, modern look.

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,270
And I think that's what this campus is designed to do.

34
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,220
It'll be a cutting edge technologically.

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,360
But aesthetically it tries to draw on the region we're in, the Jiangnan

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,699
region, particularly the Suzhou region with canals and lakes.

37
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,420
You can't see it here, but there will be water everywhere on campus.

38
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,170
And instead of a grass quadrangle, we have

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,730
a lake in the center of the campus.

40
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,750
So this is one of the ways that we're trying

41
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,990
to really develop the elements of the region.

42
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,320
This building will house faculty, students, auditorium, classrooms,

43
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
dining room.

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,960
It's about 200,000 square feet.

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,230
But as you can also see, we have four additional buildings,

46
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,310
which will be opening this fall.

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,720
And we will have housing for 200 students, a 200 bed conference center.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,942
You're welcome to come and use our conference center.

49
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:49,160
BILL KIRBY: Thank you.

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,220
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: And a service building.

51
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,140
So this is really the beginning of Duke Kunshan University.

52
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,580
BILL KIRBY: And it's phase one of Duke Kunshan University.

53
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,840
It's phase one of three on a 200 acre campus right

54
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,990
in the heart of the fastest developing part of China between Shanghai

55
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,680
and Nanjing-- right in the heart of what may someday be, I think,

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,260
a city called Nanhai-- Nanjing-Shanghai.

57
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,960
Or maybe not just a city, because this will ideally remain green.

58
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,720
Now in terms of getting around, so much water here, will you have gondolas?

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,470
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: No, I don't think-- we have beautiful bridges.

60
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,010
We have beautiful bridges that evoke a Chinese bridge feeling.

61
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,860
But it's actually true that when you come from the student dormitory

62
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,155
to the classroom, you have to go across two bridges.

63
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:38,870
So that will be kind of fun.

64
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,410
I think we all enjoy seeing the lake in its final manifestations.

65
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,760
BILL KIRBY: Well, we're here right before the opening.

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,630
And this will air after the opening.

67
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,040
And we'll know a bit more at that point how things have gone.

68
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,150
But it's an extraordinary effort and extraordinary ambition

69
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,560
on the part of Duke and also on the part of Kunshan.

70
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,227
So congratulations, you're almost there.

71
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,851
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: We're almost there.

72
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:03,180
BILL KIRBY: Thanks, Mary

73
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:13,462
