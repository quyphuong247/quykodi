Interview with Kunshan Party Secretary Guan Aiguo June 20, 2014

1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,640
What is your vision for what Duke can do with Kunshan,

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,480
for Kunshan and together,

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:27,640
if you think of Duke Kunshan University 20 years from now?

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,080
We have just founded Duke Kunshan University.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,000
To speak of twenty years from now,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,400
we must first speak of the present

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,680
right, right, right

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
Why do we collaborate with Duke University?

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,160
I believe, uh... in 1997 we experienced

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,720
the effect of the Asian financial crisis on Kunshan

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,000
Of course,  it wasn't just Kunshan that was effected

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,480
Kunshan was effected relatively badly

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,840
2008, 2009 it was effected even worse

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,480
Throughout Kunshan's more than thirty years

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,600
of opening up and reform, during this time of development

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,320
we feel that one of its biggest difficulties was

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,440
the dearth of human capital

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,080
because Kunshan does not have very prestigious universities

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,400
Kunshan has universities, but our foundation is not deep.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,440
Every economically prosperous, or stable city

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,120
with sufficient human capital

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,120
all have universities to support them

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,000
North Carolina is prosperous because it has Duke University

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,360
the Bay Area has University of California Berkeley

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,200
no matter where, even what used to be an industrial city,

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Pittsburgh, has Carnegie Mellon

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,520
It's because of Carnegie Mellon

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,920
that they were able to revitalize the city

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,480
So for Kunshan, even though we are not an old industrial city

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,640
we are a new industrial city

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:17,160
But if we don't build up our human capital,

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,120
our growth will not last, it will not last

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:33,600
So we really hope to attract or found some prestigious universities.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,760
to attract some research institutes

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:45,360
to support our city's  economic, societal etc. development

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,600
When we attract these institutions,

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,640
we are not just attracting purely science or technological institutions

38
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,000
We also emphasize researching strategy.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,560
We created Kunshan industry innovation research institute

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,840
We invited many mainland China's prestigious experts,

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,600
experts in economics.

42
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,920
We invited experts from Taiwan

43
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,440
to research Kunshan's industry's innovation and position

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,840
How should the city continue to develop? We are researching this.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,400
Once we had this opportunity with Duke University

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,520
we really hope that we can through collaboration with Duke University,

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,200
we can take many of the problems of Kunshan's next steps

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,440
and give them to Duke University to solve

49
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,760
to help us, or push us to mutually develop and improve

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Our relationship with Duke has also spurred other schools' interest

51
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,120
for example Harvard University, you professor Kirby

52
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,840
for example other American universities,

53
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,760
such as Yale, respect Kunshan

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,280
Lots of american universities are now investigating

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,640
"Why did Duke University come to Kunshan?"

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,160
"What is Kunshan?"

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,240
This already achieves one small part of our goals

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,200
We have incited other people's interest.

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:45,360
Through Duke University, we can build up our human capital

60
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,720
At the same time, through Duke University,

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,000
we can allow the world to better understand Kunshan

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,360
This will also improve our ability to access the world's resources

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,000
Duke University, when president Brodhead came to Kunshan

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,720
The Financial Times (UK) wrote about it.

65
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,440
Without Duke, the Financial Times would not mention Kunshan

66
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,400
They would not know about Kunshan.

67
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,720
Who knows of Kunshan?

68
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,760
Only most manufacturers do.

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,640
I asked my teachers and classmates, how do you see Kunshan?

70
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,440
What is your impression of Kunshan?

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:41,200
They told me, Kunshan is just a big manufacturing factory.

72
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,120
If it continues down this path,

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,080
it may become where pollution is instigated

74
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,000
I was heartbroken

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,520
I was heartbroken

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,880
Kunshan worked so arduously

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,320
The Kunshan people sweated blood and tears

78
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,280
and we get described by outsiders this way

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,800
we must change our method of economic development

80
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
But if you are to change your methods

81
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,160
without other forms of human capital, it is impossible.

82
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,840
So we want to invite Duke University here.

83
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,320
Duke University's history is not long,

84
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,920
compared to other American universities, its history is not long.

85
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,040
One hundred plus years, yes, one hundred plus years

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,520
but it is extremely successful.

87
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,080
It even spurred on North Carolina's development.

88
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,560
North Carolina's research triangle's development

89
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,120
This is something we really appreciate.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,600
We hope that Kunshan Duke University, DKU, can in Kunshan

91
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:56,640
like Duke University did for North Carolina, grow its high tech sector

92
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,680
can act as an instigator.

93
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,920
This is why we want to collaborate with Duke University.

94
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,680
So I think in twenty years,

95
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:14,600
DKU will in Kunshan act as a pillar in its new sector

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,480
But one Duke is not enough, one Duke is not enough

97
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,080
We hope to use other methods to create a system

98
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,720
for Kunshan's economic and societal development

99
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,200
Secretary Guan, I know how busy -

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,840
you are so busy

101
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,160
and we've taken so much of your time

102
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,720
and I want to explain to our learners out there that we

103
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,600
had a wonderful conversation

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,520
with Secretary Guan Aiguo

105
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,920
of Kunshan, China's most successful small city,

106
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,320
led by China's most extraordinary

107
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,160
at least in my acquaintance

108
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,600
local leader who is

109
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,840
entrepreneurial in the absolute best sense

110
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,880
and a man who has helped with

111
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,600
of course, helped with, by many others,

112
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,360
to make Kunshan the remarkable story that it has become.
