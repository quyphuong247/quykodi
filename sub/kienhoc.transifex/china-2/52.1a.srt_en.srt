1
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,265
What is Taiwan?

2
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:14,660
Is it a model of export-driven development

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,390
so successful that its foreign reserves are the fifth largest in the world?

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,440
Yes.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,550
Is a self-governing state with its own constitution, flag, anthem, army,

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,780
air force, and navy?

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,960
Yes.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,320
Is it the first democratically governed state in Chinese history?

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,410
Is it widely recognized internationally as an independent political entity?

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,810
No.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,940
Is it at war with China?

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,270
No.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,490
Is it at peace with China?

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,320
Not yet.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,790
Is it an island with a complex set of historical economic, political,

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,510
strategic, and identity issues?

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,740
Absolutely.

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,520
That so-called Taiwan question has been at the heart

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,060
of politics in East Asia since 1950 when the Americans intervened

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,090
in the Chinese Civil War, or perhaps since 1895

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,220
when Taiwan became part of the Japanese Empire.

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,450
It is a contested place that has played an important role in the story

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,820
of modern China and modern Asia.

25
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,410
Today, relations between the People's Republic of China on the mainland

26
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,950
and the Republic of China on Taiwan are improving rapidly.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,050
Taiwan's investment in the mainland has played

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,410
a major role in China's economic boom in recent decades.

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,770
Investments, partnership, study, travel, and marriage across the strait

30
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,630
point to a future of ever greater interaction between the two parties--

31
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,980
these same two parties that brought Asia to the brink of war three times

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:50,200
in the last half century-- 1954, 1958, and 1996.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,120
But what does the future hold?

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,070
Will Taiwan thrive and yet maintain its autonomy

35
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,130
as part of the broader economy of Greater China?

36
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,350
Will economic integration lead inexorably to Taiwan's incorporation

37
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,280
into the People's Republic of China?

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,780
How might current global trends affect any of this?

39
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,790
To gain perspective on modern Taiwan, we have to look first to its history.

40
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,340
Taiwan is a mountainous island roughly the size of Massachusetts

41
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,270
and Connecticut put together.

42
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,100
It lies east of China, northwest of the Philippines.

43
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,740
It has a population today of about 23 million people comprised

44
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,580
of 84% self-identified Taiwanese, including the Hakka minority

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,220
group, most of whose ancestors migrated from mainland China

46
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,400
in recent centuries.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,510
Then there are 14% or so so-called Mainland Chinese,

48
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,860
primarily those families who fled the Communist Revolution

49
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,740
in 1949 and their descendants.

50
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,060
And there is a small percentage of indigenous people

51
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,740
there before any Chinese.

52
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,630
Archaeological evidence suggests that 8,000 years ago,

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,780
long before it came into the Chinese orbit,

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,440
Taiwan was populated by Austronesian peoples

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,540
who approached it over water, probably from what is today the Philippines.

56
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,930
By the time of the Yuan and Ming dynasties on the mainland,

57
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,160
coastal Chinese traders and fishermen were traveling back and forth

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,710
across the strait and trading with Taiwan's coastal Aborigines.

59
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,660
Small numbers of these Chinese traders may

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,470
have resided for short periods in Taiwan's coastal settlements.

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,650
During the 17th century, Taiwan was identified first

62
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,615
by the Dutch, who arrived in southern Taiwan

63
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:40,815
in 1623, and then by the Spanish, arriving in northern Taiwan

64
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:48,090
in 1626, as a very profitable commercial location with all kinds of supplies--

65
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,420
animal pelts, camphor, and other agricultural products.

66
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,170
The Dutch ousted the Spanish from northern Taiwan,

67
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,290
and they governed the island through the Dutch East India Company

68
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,820
until 1662, when they in turn were thrown out by the Ming loyalist Zheng

69
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,270
Chenggong, who sought refuge on Taiwan as a base from which to continue

70
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,940
his fight against the Manchu, or the new Qing

71
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,490
dynasty, which had conquered the Ming.

72
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,160
And he brought with him an army, and he rapidly

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,350
established a new Chinese-style government in southern Taiwan.

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,710
When his government in turn was defeated by the Qing in 1683,

75
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,920
Taiwan came under Qing control and was gradually incorporated

76
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,680
into the Southern Province of Fujian.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:45,398
