1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,060
An increasing number of major cities, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing,

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,540
and Guangzhou, are acting on their own to promote, and in some cases,

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,790
mandating clean air by the use of alternative fuel vehicles.

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,930
In Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, all taxis and motorcycles

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,390
must be fueled only by compressed natural gas.

6
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:37,300
Beijing, despite its terrible air, does boast the country's largest fleet

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,040
of natural gas buses.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,340
And as a result of these kind of measures,

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,850
natural gas consumption in China is projected to increase by more than 600%

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,690
by 2025, which will help to reduce the country's

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,570
reliance on solid, pollution-heavy fuels.

12
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,420
Chinese and international firms, too, have invested significantly

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,590
in renewable energy projects in China.

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,570
The Chinese government has announced a $265 million

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,220
goal to have 15% of the country's global energy

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,680
demand met by renewable resources by 2020.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,910
Renewable energy resources still meet today

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,760
only a tiny portion of the nation's energy needs.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,700
In the 12th five-year plan, the national government

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,970
sought to take the gain-- this is the five-year plan from 2011 to 2015--

21
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:39,280
by investing in environmental protection and introducing new strategic emerging

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,300
industries, focusing on energy saving and environmental protection.

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,870
The plan listed a broad spectrum of environmental goals,

24
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,170
including increased production of renewable energy,

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,310
advances to improve food production, and the development of water substitutes

26
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,170
and more efficient use of water.

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,790
China's environmental challenges are the result

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,580
in part of government policies encouraging

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,940
widespread, unrestrained industrialization.

30
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,740
At the same time, this is perhaps one government

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,500
in the world that has the capacity to deal, from strength, with challenges

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,370
of this size.

33
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,651
