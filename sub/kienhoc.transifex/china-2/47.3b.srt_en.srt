[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02,904 --> 00:00:09,670


3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,170
Julia?

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,090
Because we don't know anything about them.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,990
Maybe because-- exactly.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,150
They're really well known in China, but maybe not so famous internationally.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,670
Jasmine?

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,990
Well, perhaps they have a company history to be proud of.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,980
They have a company history, absolutely, to be extraordinarily proud of.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,629
Hannah?

11
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,670
Well, maybe they need to just get more well-known

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,160
and maybe get some connections with business.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,370
It might help their business in a practical way

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,280
if they become better known.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,971
Zack?

16
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:38,720
Perhaps they also would derive some value just by reading the case

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,180
and understanding from your perspective, or the actual authors,

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,035
what made them successful.

19
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:43,410
It might help them going forward.

20
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,652
There is the aspiration, at least at the business school,

21
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:48,360
that the students and the faculty members

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,490
will have some ideas that actually might assist the company in thinking

23
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,870
of some strategic decisions.

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,880
Because we always end each case-- this case

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,000
since you know it-- we'll be asking you what advice would

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,835
you give to Mr. Lu and Mr. Ni Pin.

27
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:03,960
Josh, did you have a point?

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,600
It was essentially the same thing.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,311
That for the future they can look at their past history.

30
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:08,810
Right.

31
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,750
I think all of this.

32
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,620
So it's a well known story domestically.

33
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,490
They have a global strategy.

34
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,880
They had success in telling their story through these comic books in China.

35
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,810
Also, a key decision about to be made.

36
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,230
What do they go for next?

37
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,230
Do they stick to this core business of automobile parts?

38
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,175
Or do they do something dramatically different?

39
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,050
Now let me just go through this very briefly.

40
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,600
There are all kinds of challenges of writing a case.

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,830
You write it, but you have to get feedback from it.

42
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,230
Are the facts right?

43
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,434
The numbers change, they've changed a lot

44
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,100
since the numbers you have your in case.

45
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,230
They're almost double in every capacity.

46
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,370
You have to communicate to the headquarters in both Hangzhou

47
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,070
and Elgin.

48
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,480
There's a political issue, potentially, for a Chinese company

49
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,060
that isn't well known.

50
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,370
How much do they want to be known for what

51
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,075
they're doing in the United States?

52
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:09,789
At least it has to be thought about.

53
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,890
And then you have to translate it into Chinese

54
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,700
so Chairman Lu can read it and get some suggestions, and so on.

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,210
And so I think this thing got released like two days

56
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,090
before I taught it the first day at HBS-- a little bit

57
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,330
too much just-in-time management.

58
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,934
So now, this is how one would teach this case

59
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:38,770
and try to situate Wanxiang for you guys.

60
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:44,040
One way of doing this, since this is a course on China, not just on business,

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,850
what difference does it make that this is in Zhejiang, this place?

62
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,632
