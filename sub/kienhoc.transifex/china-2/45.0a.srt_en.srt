1
00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:13,540
The death of Mao Zedong on September 9th, 1976,

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,810
marked not only the changing of hands of the CCP leadership,

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,160
but also the beginning of a new era of Chinese history.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,050
In the months following the chairman's funeral, the Gang of Four,

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,060
Mao's last wife, Jiang Qing, and three of her revolutionary comrades

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,180
vied for political supremacy with the designated successor, Hua Guofeng.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,720
But ultimately, they were torn from their seats of power

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,180
and put on trial for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution.

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,800
Though deft in his ousting of the gang, Hua himself

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,670
would prove only an interim leader, being out maneuvered

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,870
in turn by a rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping.

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,370
Following his rise to supremacy in 1978, Deng

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,130
rallied support to begin steering the nation away from the Maoist

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,040
model of development and toward a market oriented system.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,950
The household responsibility system initiated in 1981

16
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,280
decollectivized farming, dividing communal lands among rural families

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,550
and making individual households responsible for the profits

18
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,600
and losses of their agricultural production.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,270
The iron rice bowl, this promise of cradle

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,260
to grave support from military personnel and urban state employees,

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,800
was partially retracted in favor of competitive job selection

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,180
and employer based health care.

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,710
Rationing systems and state controlled pricing

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,730
gradually gave way to market supply and demand and special economic zones.

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,840
These administrative regions with relaxed, business and trade regulations

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,630
transformed a handful of designated cities

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,160
into the primary engines of China's economic growth, this "Gaige kaifang"--

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,790
literally, "reform and opening up," was part of economic liberalism

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,020
which witnessed the remaking of the PRC and a shift of the ideological center

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,150
from Mao to market.

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,650
With the more liberal wing of the Communist party

32
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,310
growing in power in this environment of pragmatism,

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,139
some began to call for political reform.

34
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,680
In April of 1989, after the death of liberal reformer Hu Yaobang,

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,370
students from Peking, Tsinghua, and other universities in Beijing

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,350
began to gather in Tiananmen Square to mourn Hu

37
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,380
and erect shrines in his remembrance.

38
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,810
As this informal gathering became more organized and eulogizing

39
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,580
evolved into broader political critique, the students

40
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,770
staged a month long sit-in followed by a hunger strike

41
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,710
during the Mikhail Gorbachev state visit.

42
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,860
Millions of students participated in such demonstrations across all of China

43
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
in every major city.

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,610
Martial law was ultimately declared at the end of May.

45
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,970
And on June 4th, armed PLA tanks and troops

46
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,460
were sent to clear the square by force.

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,960
Across the strait, Taiwan experienced democratic reform

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,480
amid continued economic growth.

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,010
In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party

50
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,680
was established as the first opposition party to the Guomingdang.

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,550
And in the following year, martial law was

52
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,220
lifted on the island for the first time since the civil war.

53
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,410
A decade later, Taiwan attempted its first direct presidential election.

54
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,280
Fearing that separationists would assume control of the government,

55
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,630
the PRC launched a series of test missiles off the coast of Taiwan

56
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,380
to alter voter sentiments in favor of prounification incumbents.

57
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,820
This act of aggression, later known as the Taiwan Strait Crisis,

58
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,790
provoked US President Bill Clinton to provide Taiwan with naval support

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,570
and sign the Taiwan Relations Act.

60
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,500
Ultimately, the developmental path of the PRC

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,980
would diverge from that of Taiwan.

62
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,200
Economic liberalization would not be accompanied

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,642
by political liberalization.

64
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:54,630
Yet even after formally retiring from office,

65
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,160
Deng would continue to strengthen the national commitment to economic reform

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,190
by appointing Zhu Rongji, the former mayor of Shanghai, as vice premier

67
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,500
and personally visiting the SEZs, the Special Economic Zones of Guangzhou,

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,350
Shenzhen, and Zhuhai on a celebrated 1992 southern tour.

69
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,680
Jiang Zemin, perhaps in recognition of the importance

70
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,920
of economic growth for national stability,

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,270
would continue Deng's legacy by relegating

72
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,540
most of China's economic governments to Zhu Rongji, who

73
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,490
would complete the breaking of the iron rice bowl

74
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,190
and launch a massive initiative to develop cities in inland China.

75
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,800
Under the succeeding reigns of Hu Jintao and more recently,

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,040
Xi Jinping, China continued along its trajectory of rapid economic growth,

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,220
though the negative consequences of these decades

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,750
of unrestrained development became increasingly apparent.

79
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,740
The country now faces an aging demographic.

80
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,230
Single child couples will each have to support four elderly parents.

81
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,400
It faces problems of environmental degradation.

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,530
Air pollution in Beijing is now so severe

83
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,150
that the acceptable smog standard was increased

84
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,890
just so they would reach fewer days with critical levels of air pollution.

85
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,740
It faces the constant threat of an overheated economy.

86
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,770
Ghost cities void of inhabitants, the products of official corruption

87
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,870
and over ambitious central planning can now be found in hidden pockets

88
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,630
across the mainland.

89
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,740
The future of China remains uncertain.

90
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,950
Yet so far, in the face of these daunting obstacles,

91
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,360
the CCP and the nation it governs have proven supremely resilient.

92
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,930
The question then as we enter the final part of our course

93
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,910
is does China have the adaptive capacity to continue

94
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,950
to meet these growing challenges?

95
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,650
Or perhaps put in a more direct way, will the 21st century

96
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,720
be the century of China?

97
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,939
