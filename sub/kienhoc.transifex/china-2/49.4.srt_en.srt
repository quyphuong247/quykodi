1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,720
BILL KIRBY: So let's go back to this Taiwan question.

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,590
What does it take to attract and retain investment?

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,420
It's counted as foreign investment.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,080
It's from Taiwan, so it's part of Greater China, to be sure.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,397
But it's counted as foreign.

6
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:27,980
What does it take, Joshua, to do that?

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,540
JOSHUA: Part of it mentions, they've made it Taiwanese friendly,

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,020
if you like.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,020
They've created Taiwanese infrastructure and made

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,686
it very compatible with their lifestyle.

11
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:37,990
BILL KIRBY: So what is the difference of Taiwanese lifestyle?

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,460
JOSHUA: I'm guessing just things like food--

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,460
BILL KIRBY: Restaurants.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,245
JOSHUA: Karaoke

15
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:43,078
BILL KIRBY: Karaoke?

16
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:44,030
JOSHUA: Yeah.

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,120
BILL KIRBY: You think the Taiwanese are the only ones who like karaoke?

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,705
JOSHUA: No.

19
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:47,620
BILL KIRBY: Yeah.

20
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,190
JOSHUA: What else does it mention?

21
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,210
Tea houses, schools for the children.

22
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,590
BILL KIRBY: Schools, so you can go and have

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,110
a school that will help you pass the examinations back in Taiwan,

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,110
so your family can move back and forth.

25
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,959
There are whole sets of neighborhoods.

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,430
Tea, I went through a tea house in Kunshan,

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,720
has 80 different types of tea, all from Taiwan.

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,480
It's like a home away from home.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,980
Rowan--

30
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,870
ROWAN: I feel like, honestly, in order to stand out

31
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,360
in China as being Taiwanese friendly, you just

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,204
really need to not push them away.

33
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:26,370
And that's going to set you apart from pretty much everything else in China.

34
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:26,830
BILL KIRBY: Yeah.

35
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,788
Well, actually, Taiwan investment has been welcomed in a lot of places.

36
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:34,260
But this has been the most successful at attracting

37
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,200
early-stage very simple manufacturing operations, such as Giant

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,070
Bicycle and others, and then very high tech as well.

39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,940
So they've moved up the value chain and maintained and even enhanced.

40
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,530
There's a place called Huaqiao, on the way between downtown Kunshan

41
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,240
and Shanghai, which is being built as an enormous new city,

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,210
mostly for Taiwan investors, who can live there, take a train to Hongqiao

43
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:07,200
Airport and fly to downtown Taipei and be home in like three hours, which

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,639
is longer than many commute in Beijing.

45
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,260
Jasmine--

46
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,630
JASMINE: There were non-governmental institutions

47
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,660
that fostered Taiwan-Kunshan relations, such as the Association

48
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,800
for Taiwanese Investors or the cross-strait Kunshan-Taiwan Industrial

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,330
Corporation Forum.

50
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,080
BILL KIRBY: Right.

51
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,110
So they have these-- they're not really formally NGOs.

52
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,150
But nevertheless, they're non-official organizations

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,070
that allow Taiwan business people also to have

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,290
a voice in what happens in Kunshan, how things are developed

55
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,520
for their own infrastructure, for their families, and of course,

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,630
for their companies.

57
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,050
And so how many Taiwanese end up going to Kunshan and this area.

58
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,406
STUDENT: I think it's like one ninth of all Taiwanese investment into China

59
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:49,639
was in Kunshan.

60
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,680
BILL KIRBY: That's right.

61
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,570
So one ninth of all Taiwanese investment is in Kunshan.

62
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,410
There are at least 500,000, but probably more,

63
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,610
Taiwanese invested in the Shanghai-Kunshan-Suzhou area,

64
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,690
but a denser proportion in the Kunshan area,

65
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,830
per capita, than in any other part.

66
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,920
There are maybe 2 million Taiwanese living on a permanent basis

67
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
on the mainland, again, largely in this area,

68
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,579
and also in Fujian and in Guandong.

69
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,620
That's out of a population of how many in Taiwan?

70
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,946
SPEAKER 5: 23 million.

71
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,700
BILL KIRBY: 23 million.

72
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,810
So that's a lot of people.

73
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,310
And it's not always the same people.

74
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,150
Yeah, Sarah.

75
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,170
SARAH: Clarification-- are the migrant workers

76
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,470
included under the temporary residents?

77
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,060
BILL KIRBY: Yes, yes.

78
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,000
They are the temporary-- and so is this a rich place, successful today?

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,972
SARAH: Yes.

80
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,716
BILL KIRBY: How rich?

81
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:45,880
STUDENT: 20,000 GDP

82
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,735


83
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:51,970
BILL KIRBY: It's about $20,000 GDP per capita, counting everybody.

84
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,950
And if you do the statistics just to count the legal residents, it's what?

85
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,220
$50,000 US, which would be higher than Cambridge

86
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,510
or a lot of parts of the United States.

87
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,540
But counting everybody, it's still an extraordinary number,

88
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,466
well more than three or four times the national average.

89
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:08,965
Sachin--

90
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:12,320
SACHIN: I was going to ask-- are these people who now live in Kunshan,

91
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,180
these Taiwanese people, especially given their wealth,

92
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,959
are they more satisfied with the Chinese-Taiwanese relations

93
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,522
than perhaps people in Taiwan?

94
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:20,980
BILL KIRBY: That's a good question.

95
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,400
Are the residents from Taiwan who are living in Kunshan more satisfied

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,840
with cross-strait relations?

97
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,440
I think the secret to this, to business success and for Kunshan in particular,

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,430
you can go through these exhibits and see everything about Taiwan investment.

99
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,310
You won't see a single word about politics.

100
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,970
So the secret is butan zhengzhi-- don't talk about politics.

101
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,820
And if you don't talk about politics, you

102
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,130
can pretty much just focus on cross-strait development, which

103
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,690
is really, in this context, a total win-win operation for Kunshan

104
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,810
and for the Taiwan companies that invest in it.

105
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,310
All right.

106
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,311
So now we've pretty much nailed this.

107
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:11,030
Let me just say, we have here also-- and they've been very, very successful.

108
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,350
They've gone from making bicycles.

109
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,530
We'll see some pictures of baby carriages.

110
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,280
One of the most successful companies, locally-developed companies,

111
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,550
is called Good Baby.

112
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,370
Most of you have been in their baby carriages,

113
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,280
because they're marketed under many-- they

114
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,380
don't market it under their own name.

115
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,200
I can guarantee you a huge percentage of the baby carriages in the world

116
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,500
are made in Kunshan by this company Good Baby.

117
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,720
EMMA: But is business with Taiwan treated as business

118
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,540
with a foreign country or like domestic business?

119
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,750
BILL KIRBY: It's formally foreign direct investment.

120
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,180
But it is also treated differently and with a great deal

121
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,700
more hands-on attention because of the importance of the relationship.

122
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,440
So it will be very unpolitical, the fact that people

123
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,950
will be encouraged to bring in Taiwan investment

124
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,630
and that Taiwan investment might be preferred

125
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,320
over other international investment.

126
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,670
What's surprising is that it seems to have survived,

127
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,870
without a blip, the extraordinary tensions in cross-strait relations

128
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,960
of the 1990s and the 2000s, in the presidencies of Lee Teng-hui

129
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,400
and Chen Shui-bian on Taiwan.

130
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,240
And this has continued just straight through those periods.

131
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,120
And that actually is the larger surprise.

132
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,008
