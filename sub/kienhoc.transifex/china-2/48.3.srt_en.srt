00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,765
PROFESSOR KIRBY: We're here in the beautiful Gong Zi Ting,

2
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:14,005
the oldest building on the Tsinghua campus.

3
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:18,570
A former royal pavilion built in the Kangxi period of the Qing,

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,360
and now, very wisely, a center for the President of the University

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,230
to hold special meetings.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,900
And we're very, very lucky that President Chen

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,020
Jining, the young and dynamic president of Tsinghua University, who

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,600
already in a short period of time has accomplished a great deal here

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,410
at Tsinghua, has agreed to speak with us about Tsinghua's past,

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,590
present, and future.

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,600
And we're actually going to start a little bit with the future,

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,370
and ask him to talk about his vision for Tsinghua's future.

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,610
But first of all, thank you very, very much, President Chen, for your time.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,610
I know how busy you are.

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,520


16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,130
PRESIDENT CHEN: Tsinghua has done a lot in the past to help China,

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:12,500
to help China's development, to introduce the Western science

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,120
and humanities knowledge back to China, and has

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,140
functioned as a bridge between East and West.

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,490
And in the future, we would like to continue the role

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,470
as a bridge between East and West.

22
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,340
And we want to be more international, and we want to not only

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,580
to look at the university how we contribute to China,

24
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,370
but also we want to give more contribution to the world.

25
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,260
And we certainly want to be excellent in academic performance.

26
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,880


27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,270
Academics and the student is certainly the center of the university,

28
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,250
and we want it to be the leader in the world.

29
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,790
That's the wish we certainly have.

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,698
PROFESSOR KIRBY: One of the ways in which you're doing this,

31
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:11,170
and to be a leading university in the world,

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,970
is to re-establish Tsinghua at what you call a comprehensive university.

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,680
Can you explain to us a little bit more what your thoughts are on that?

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,530
PRESIDENT CHEN: Originally when Tsinghua was established, we fully copied how

35
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,206
the American universities operate, like a liberal arts university.

36
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:38,220
And it's a comprehensive one, it covers all the fields,

37
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,670
and there is an emphasis on a liberal arts education.

38
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,870
And then, in the 1950s, all the higher education systems in China

39
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,750
followed the Russian model, and the whole education was restructured

40
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:02,865
and Tsinghua became an engineering or technology dominated university

41
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:05,580
in the 1950s.

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,910
And that is good, too.

43
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,370
That period, when China was coming into a new stage and the country

44
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,220
required huge of engineers.

45
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,060
So Tsinghua played a central role for that period.

46
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:31,410
But in the 1980s, when China opened its policies, implemented open policies,

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,620
we realized that we couldn't be only a technical university,

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,040
and the country certainly required students who have a broader background.

49
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,570
And as a leading university, we had to think

50
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,990
what we could do for our students.

51
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:55,600
So the university decided to restructure the university

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,920
as a comprehensive university.

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,730
Another reason is because in the history we already

54
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,270
educated a large number of faculty and students

55
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,960
who perform superbly in humanities and the social sciences.

56
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,720
And they always had the dream that they wanted

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,180
to take the university back to what we used to be.

58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,370
So that's two forces taking the university

59
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,390
to be restructure the structure of the university.

60
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,850
So the whole process started, actually, in the 1980s, but it's very difficult.

61
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,520
And it took about 30 years to restructure the university

62
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,840
as a comprehensive university.

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,080
And during the restructuring stage, we also took a lot of time

64
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,130
to discuss what strategy we should implement.

65
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,820
The Chinese humanity and social sciences at that time

66
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,890
were very, very traditional.

67
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,130
Much more like the Soviet Union model, and in the beginning

68
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,130
when we restructured, it was quite clear to the university leaders

69
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,470
that we need to be international, to develop

70
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,530
this plan in the international knowledge.

71
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,010
So that's very, very important to the Chinese.

72
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,360
So actually, at that time, all the Chinese universities

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,520
faced the same problem.

74
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,880
So we took a full turn at the right time to form-- we don't have any burden,

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,960
so we implemented this international strategy that

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,170
was different from other universities.

77
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,500
It was more easy to do this.

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,440
So that's why we were able to very quickly, in 30 years' time-- actually,

79
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,620
most of it happened in the last 20 to 10 years.

80
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,040
The humanities and the social sciences in China, and of this university

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:01,130
became dominant and became a leading institution in China.

82
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,100
PROFESSOR KIRBY: But one of the things that is happening all over China today,

83
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,500
and in some sense Tsinghua's early history is

84
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,200
a model of the power of this idea, is the introduction,

85
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,580
or we should say reintroduction, of the conceptions of general education.

86
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,070
General education for the next generation of Chinese leaders.

87
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,620
The current or previous generations of Chinese leaders

88
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,560
have been, happily for you, mostly Tsinghua graduates and engineers,

89
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,185
and yet even they claim that one of the things that China

90
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,810
needs to do in the future is have a broader

91
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,570
education for the next generation, be it of engineers or others, who

92
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,870
will lead the country.

93
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,710
Can you tell us a little bit about your thoughts about general education?

94
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,340
PRESIDENT CHEN: Well, even in the 1950s when Tsinghua was an engineering

95
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,470
university, we still emphasized broad education.

96
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,940
Broad education never disappeared from the university.

97
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,700
And even today, if you look at how we recruit our students, how we organize

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,630
our students, it's still very traditional.

99
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,280
I'm not saying we have done a fully liberal arts education,

100
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,490
but a broad education is always a central part

101
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,870
in the mind of the faculty and the university leaders.

102
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,220
And we're still in the changing stage.

103
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,526
One of the challenges is when you really want to offer a good liberal arts

104
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:35,955
education, you need to have a good faculty.

105
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,830
PROFESSOR KIRBY: Yes.

106
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,447
PRESIDENT CHEN: And you can't really say, well, I want to be a liberal arts.

107
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:43,530
Internationally, you want everything to be liberal arts, but you can't it.

108
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,770
You do that, then you can only offer a very low quality education.

109
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,832
That's not good work.

110
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:49,790
PROFESSOR KIRBY: Right.

111
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,985
PRESIDENT CHEN: So you have to think about how-- well, quality

112
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:55,090
is always the center.

113
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,992
When you can't really offer a real liberal arts education,

114
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:03,840
then, well, it's better to keep it as the one we already have.

115
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,986
But the strategy is you have to realize the problem you have,

116
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:14,000
and you have to be very determined to change what you have right now,

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,994
and the change is to happen.

118
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,160
That's very, very important.

119
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,740
And it may take a few years, or even longer, to complete the process.

120
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,270
You can't really complete it in one-- very short term.

121
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,390
That will only sacrifice your quality.

122
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,350
So that's not what we want to do.

123
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,429
PROFESSOR KIRBY: Tsinghua is a university

124
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:42,490
that has a kind of an international imprint from its birth with Boxer

125
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,310
Return Funds from the United States and the training of Chinese students

126
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,380
to go to the United States.

127
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:54,980
And then reborn as a great technical and engineering and science university

128
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,960
with Soviet advice and support in the 1950s.

129
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,580
Another moment of great internationalization even,

130
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,300
if not with the West, than with the East.

131
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,060
Can you tell us a bit more about where you're headed

132
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,242
and what you might hope with internationalization

133
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:17,320
plans of the early 21st century for the university?

134
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,274
PRESIDENT CHEN: Well, if you look at the history of the university,

135
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:21,190
it's very interesting.

136
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:30,190
In the early days, it's very closely linked to China's policy

137
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,110
with international communities.

138
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:40,550
In the 1930s, '20s, '40s, China was very closely linked with the United States,

139
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,590
and Tsinghua certainly had a lot of links

140
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,390
to universities in the United States.

141
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,820
And in the 1950s, we had a close link with Russia and also Eastern Europe.

142
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,690
But in the 1960s, actually, China isolated.

143
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,700
We didn't have a close link with any universities.

144
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,866
And if you look at the 1980s, we didn't have

145
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,740
a close link with United States universities.

146
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,090
We had links with Japanese universities, and in the 1990s,

147
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,760
actually we had a lot of links with European universities.

148
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,170
The link with the United States' universities is still very, very big.

149
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,740
Not like today, but since the late 1990s,

150
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,290
the exchange between the faculty here and the United States

151
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,270
became much, much stronger than any other countries.

152
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:38,610
So the link is-- So you can say today we have a lot of partnerships,

153
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,590
a lot of collaborations with universities in the United States.

154
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:49,330
And in the 20th century, we believed China

155
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,050
needed a much more balanced view of the world.

156
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,620
And actually, we want more international students to come to China.

157
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:05,050
And we have targeted, in three year's time, 10% of our students

158
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,010
will be international.

159
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,530
And it's very interesting that America is the number one now,

160
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,550
to study for a degree, not for --

161
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,550
PROFESSOR KIRBY: Really?

162
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,670
More than Korea?

163
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,711
PRESIDENT CHEN: More than Korea, more than Japan,

164
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,760
more than any other countries.

165
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,650
And America is number one to study in China, and one of the ways

166
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,196
that really depends on how the university can offer very good quality

167
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:33,122
programs.

168
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:35,440
I think that's the key.

169
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
And also, internationally, English is a key part,

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:47,580
so we encourage English lectures in the university, we opened over 400 courses

171
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,540
in English, and we have 12 master programs

172
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,770
that are fully taught in English.

173
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:01,360
That's also a very good way to create an international culture in a university.

174
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:11,930
And we also want our students to have more links with international students.

175
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,380
So we have another two targets.

176
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,330
One is 40% of our undergraduate students we

177
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,620
hope to have international experience during their four years' time,

178
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,450
and we hope to get that figure in two years' time.

179
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,240
And we want 80% of our Ph.D. Students to have international experience.

180
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,750
And also we developed a special program to encourage students

181
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,060
not only to go to the United States-- because they like to go there.

182
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,410
You don't need to worry.

183
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,700
And we encourage our students to hold exchange programs,

184
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,890
with other countries, particularly with developing countries.

185
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:02,760
So that's also part of the university's international program.

186
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,570
PROFESSOR KIRBY: You know, thinking about how Tsinghua has developed

187
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,690
relations with the United States, even with our university,

188
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,370
no Harvard president had ever visited Tsinghua,

189
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:19,550
but I know since the 1990s, President Rudenstein then President Summers, now

190
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,250
President Faust all have come to Tsinghua.

191
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,330
And it's a natural thing.

192
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,120
It's natural for the leaders of institutions

193
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,600
now to come to China, and particularly to Tsinghua

194
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,140
to Beida, and the leading universities here in China.

195
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,350
And it's natural that we all want more students to come to China.

196
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,690
Last month I was very fortunate to be with you and watching you

197
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:51,190
at the Great Hall of the People for the inauguration of the Schwarzman Scholars

198
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,390
Program at Tsinghua University, which is really a signature

199
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,570
project of your presidency and is an extraordinary commitment

200
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,380
on the part, of course, of Steve Schwarzman

201
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,627
and his support of an international college, Schwarzman College, here

202
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:09,910
at Tsinghua University.

203
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,490
But also on the part of Tsinghua University

204
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,860
in making such a bold commitment to internationalization

205
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,030
to be the host of what we aspire to have as the Rhodes

206
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,800
Scholarship of the 21st Century.

207
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,940
Not to Oxford, however, but to Tsinghua.

208
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,310
Tell us your thoughts about that.

209
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,185
PRESIDENT CHEN: Well, this is actually a part

210
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:37,800
of the international strategy of the university.

211
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:46,170
And one of the background is we certainly face more global challenges,

212
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,315
particularly when China arises in the world.

213
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:53,992
There is a lot of misunderstanding, distrust,

214
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:59,700
and they don't really know what China is going to do.

215
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:06,370
And this creates a lot of problems between countries to countries.

216
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:14,080
It creates a lot of problems to how we form a new international community,

217
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,790
and particularly how we tackle those global challenges,

218
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,770
like the environment, energy, climate issues, finance, poverty.

219
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,930
They certainly require collaboration among countries.

220
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,660
And it's very important for the future leaders

221
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:40,450
to know each other when they are young and to understand different views,

222
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:45,440
to know what people think from different points of view.

223
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,530
The issues here are very complicated.

224
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,660
So we think we need to offer the basics.

225
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,490
Offer a platform for these young people to come together, to understand China,

226
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,700
to know each other, to respect each other, and communicate.

227
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,857
And in the future when they are the world leaders,

228
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:10,790
they can easily pick up a phone to say, well, this is what I think about.

229
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,130
And I think that would be a much easier way

230
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,740
to deal with the problems we are facing in the world.

231
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,220
And that we can change to world.

232
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,060
So that's what we want to do.

233
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,080
And we're lucky we get support from Steve Schwarzman.

234
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,260
He's certainly a great man who had a very long view

235
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:37,610
and who is really very enthusiastic about the program

236
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,125
and has a determination.

237
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,030


238
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,490
We have the same values.

239
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,820
So that's why we're very lucky.

240
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,100
And also I would like to thank you very much, because you also

241
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,660
are one of the key persons to make the program to be true.

242
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,142
So we really are excited about the start of the program,

243
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:06,910
and we will do the best to make the program one of the best future leader's

244
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,929
program in the world.

245
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,720
PROFESSOR KIRBY: Well, it is very exciting.

246
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,890
It isn't very often that one gets to be part

247
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,530
of the establishment of an altogether new college

248
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,740
in a great university like Tsinghua.

249
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,418
Let me ask you just one last question.

250
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:25,089
You've been president, again, a short period of time,

251
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,390
you've done a lot already.

252
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,830
What has surprised you the most during your time as president?

253
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,980
PRESIDENT CHEN: Surprised?

254
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:40,660
Well, I'm very lucky to be a president in a special period, the special period

255
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,172
when China is under fundamental change.

256
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:49,500
And that also means the university is under a lot of change,

257
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,260
and the world is also changing.

258
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,180
That creates a lot of challenges and opportunities.

259
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,210
What really is surprising me is that every day you

260
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,880
will have faculty and students coming to see you, and that they have real ideas.

261
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,907
They have-- well, they want to talk to you.

262
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:09,740
And yet they want to talk to you, and you've never seen that before.

263
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,730
And that on second thought, well, that's great.

264
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,750
That's what we should do.

265
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,410
And that's really surprising.

266
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:22,410
And you've found the university is very dynamic and very inspirational

267
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,500
and you are lucky to be the president in that period.

268
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,957
And you must be very confident to make some change for the university.

269
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:33,790
PROFESSOR KIRBY: And every day is that good?

270
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,665
PRESIDENT CHEN: Yeah.

271
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:36,579
Every day is very hard and very good.

272
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,995
PROFESSOR KIRBY: That's wonderful.

273
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:39,659
That's absolutely wonderful to hear.

274
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,450
You know, when I'm thinking about it, we're

275
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:49,480
filming this for a new online course for Harvard which we're calling ChinaX.

276
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,920
It's a course that is possible, in many ways, because of Tsinghua University.

277
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,340
John Fairbank, who was my teacher, started

278
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,180
teaching this course at Harvard, not called ChinaX, but a general survey

279
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,345
of all Chinese history in 1939, just a few years after he

280
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:13,685
had studied his Chinese history here at Tsinghua under Jiang Tingfu, Professor

281
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:18,690
Jiang Tingfu, the Chair of the History Department here at Tsinghua University.

282
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,550
So there's a lineage of this course that goes right back to the Gong Zi Ting,

283
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:28,550
right back to the Tsinghua Xuetang, that's really quite extraordinary.

284
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,540
Now it's going to be an online course that gives,

285
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,580
at least contemporary Harvard's interpretation of China's past

286
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,320
and present and it's prospects for the future

287
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,930
in history, in literature, in art, in politics, in economy, and society.

288
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,190
And it has this long and exciting lineage.

289
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,200
Now it's wonderful to know that we're doing this

290
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,517
through edX, this new platform, and Tsinghua has just joined.

291
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:01,350
PRESIDENT CHEN: Yep.

292
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,580
PROFESSOR KIRBY: So we very much hope that this course, which

293
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,205
is in some sense an American view or an international view of China,

294
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:14,756
can be also viewed out here by your students and by others in China.

295
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,952
PRESIDENT CHEN: Yeah.

296
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:20,837
Well, we certainly would like to have the course in TsinghuaX.

297
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:21,670
PROFESSOR KIRBY: OK.

298
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,516
PRESIDENT CHEN: Yes?

299
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:24,740
PROFESSOR KIRBY: OK.

300
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,200
That would be very good, and we would look forward,

301
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,570
very much, and that after we teach it the very

302
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,670
first time, to get your feedback.

303
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,570
Your personal feedback, but that of your students and so on.

304
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,010
Are we really just waihang, or do we have

305
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:44,700
something that can foster, in a different way, a dialogue

306
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,325
between our two nations and between our two universities.

307
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:52,190
PRESIDENT CHEN: Actually, Tsinghua is a very close reflection

308
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,700
of the modern Chinese history.

309
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,350
Every part of what happened in China, well, the major happenings in China,

310
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,800
you can find something here, some very important things here.

311
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,700


312
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,060
Either it's an economic policy, politics, science, technology,

313
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:20,210
education, whatever, this is a good reflection of Chinese history.

314
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:27,240
And Tsinghua played very a leading role in many aspects in China.

315
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,050
So we still take that responsibility.

316
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,840
That's really important to the university.

317
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,740
Online education we believe is great, and that will fully

318
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,410
change higher education.

319
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,730
Not only higher education, but all education.

320
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,650
And it's very important to China, because China has a big population

321
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:57,140
and offering good quality education to everyone is a very, very big challenge.

322
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,430
And without modern technology, you can't do it.

323
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,760
And we think that will fully change China,

324
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,475
so that's why we also promote online education in China very, very greatly.

325
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,600
PROFESSOR KIRBY: You know, at Harvard and other American universities there

326
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,300
are a number of faculty that have plunged

327
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,060
into this in a very dramatic and successful way.

328
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,250
Our colleague Michael Sandel and his course on justice and others.

329
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,553
And I personally think it's important to experiment

330
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:34,680
and to try this new technology as a means of transferring

331
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,206
information and engaging students around the world.

332
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,330
There are a lot of people who are worried about it.

333
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:45,080
Who are worried that it will not be able to replicate the kind of interaction

334
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,870
that we have person-to-person here at Tsinghua or at Harvard.

335
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,807
And so I say to many American universities

336
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,685
there's a kind of a group of faculty who've

337
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,840
kind of taken the lead and a large number who

338
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,010
are, frankly, anxious about it.

339
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,767
What does the Tsinghua faculty think as far as you can tell?

340
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,350
PRESIDENT CHEN: Well, there are certainly two kinds of impact.

341
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:10,460
One is to the parity, one is to your students in your university.

342
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:17,800
And what we believe is it's actually creates more opportunities more closely

343
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,980
between students and faculty members, between students and professors.

344
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,090
Professors and students in the classroom will now discuss the knowledge.

345
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,300
They can openly discuss the critical issues.

346
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,260
So they create more question discussion in time.

347
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,470
It's changing the learning patterns, so that's very important.

348
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,930
So I think probably the impact on, we call it

349
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,550
the research university-- or leading university-- is probably more than only

350
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,490
to the public.

351
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,810
PROFESSOR KIRBY: Well, I'm very pleased to see Tsinghua taking

352
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,330
the lead in joining edX, and equally pleased to see, just a few days later,

353
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,550
that Peking University is also joining.

354
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,930
In the same way that Harvard and MIT have

355
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,030
worked on a collaborative relationship with this,

356
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,470
here we have the two leading Chinese universities also taking the lead here.

357
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,750
I know how busy you are, and I've had a fabulous time

358
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,730
over these last several days.

359
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,960
Your colleagues have assisted in filming the past, the present, and future

360
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,590
of Tsinghua University for our students.

361
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,540
So feichang ganxie thank you very much.

362
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,040
PRESIDENT CHEN: Thank you very much.

363
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,890
PROFESSOR KIRBY: Thank you.

364
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,555
