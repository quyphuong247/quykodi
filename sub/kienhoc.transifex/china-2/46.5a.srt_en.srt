1
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,350
You see those windmills down there?

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,850
I do.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,060
That's the sea, those windmills.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,250
They're what is called fengche here in Chinese.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,500
And if I were to look the opposite side of the camera,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,100
all the way back over there as far as you can see,

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,120
all this land along here and on that map, that whole curvature

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,210
on the south side of the bay-- 1,000 years ago, we were all in the sea,

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,200
under water.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,990
And so what we're seeing now is actually a whole area

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,644
that was absolutely barren wasteland, salt soil.

12
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,310
What's happened?

13
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,480
So where we are is on Hangzhou Bay, south of Shanghai, north of Ningbo.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,790
And it's the home of one of the most extraordinary

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,290
ecological, agricultural investments in China.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,860
The CP Group, its company overseas Chinese from Guangdong.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,190
Because their village in Guangdong was destroyed in 1921,

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,440
they went to Thailand and started a seed company.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,990
Two brothers started a seed company that is today

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,230
the largest feed company in the world.

21
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,230
It's an extraordinarily broad and diverse agribusiness,

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,650
active in 30 different Chinese provinces.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,140
The Xie, or Chia, brothers, Chearavanont in Thai,

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,760
started this company, now in its third generation of leadership.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,860
And Mr. Xie Guomin, Mr. Dhanin Chearavanant, Chairman of the CP Group,

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,610
is perhaps, I think probably without question,

27
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,900
the leading figure in an agricultural revolution taking place in China

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,530
without a land revolution.

29
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,860
You'll remember that Chairman Mao had a land revolution that

30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,930
came close to destroying Chinese agriculture.

31
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,030
This is an agricultural and scientific revolution

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,860
that is making Chinese agriculture again as it once had been,

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,320
one of the most productive in the world.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,360
The CP Group's business model-- and we can see this from the HBS case

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,430
that we have-- is one of controlling, but not owning,

36
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,210
the production process from farm to fork.

37
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,680
A vertically integrated process by which they oversee the agronomy,

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,850
oversee the animal husbandry in a village, through its transportation

39
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,060
to urban areas, to its processing and packaging,

40
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,290
down to its own supermarkets, the Lotus Supermarket chain, among other outfits

41
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,480
for CP foods.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,700
And it has changed not just how farmers produce,

43
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,070
but how well they're compensated for it.

44
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,470
And it has changed what urban consumers eat.

45
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:59,730
Here, by Hangzhou Bay, the Zhengda Modern Agricultural Ecological Garden

46
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:07,320
is taking 20 kilometers long of the Hangzhou Bay of reclaimed land--

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,080
land that had been very degraded, become overly saline, really not very good

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,860
for agriculture-- cleaning it up, reclaiming it

49
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,460
for an extraordinary series of experiments.

50
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,060
And we'll go to the next large billboard here

51
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:27,310
on the entryway to the CP facility and ecological garden,

52
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,630
and we'll get a bit more information about every part of this.

53
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,550
Let's go down.

54
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:37,230
Here at the CP Group's modern agricultural ecological garden

55
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:44,630
on Hangzhou Bay, we can see a detailed map of the garden planned.

56
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,660
In the spring of 2013, this facility is just opening now.

57
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,370
Not all of it is ready, but you can see the plans for it.

58
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,730
It will have sustainably grown and sustainably harvested

59
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,220
agricultural products.

60
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,920
Organic rice-- and you can see, number one,

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,530
there are the rice fields of 22,000 mu.

62
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,880
Down below is the chicken farm, and the waste from this organic chicken farm

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,420
will fertilize the rice fields.

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,620
And the plan is now for 1 million eggs to be laid.

65
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,580
A research and development and training center-- a university

66
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,340
of agribusiness and a university of agricultural science-- run

67
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,190
by the CP Group here in Hangzhou Bay, experimenting

68
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,610
with forms of food processing, concerned with food safety issues.

69
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,930
Food safety, of course, is at the heart of the what

70
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,020
you might call the agro-politics of contemporary China.

71
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,500
The fourth, the manufacturing of the produce here from farm,

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,450
as it were, directly to fork, including of processed foods

73
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,990
and ready to eat foods for supermarkets and for your dinner table.

74
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,660
Number five, a vegetable farm.

75
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,310
Number six, a high-tech greenhouse and seed facility.

76
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,800
And then last, farming isn't just for farmers anymore.

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,920
There is a center for leisure activity and for tourism activity for those

78
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,970
from the outside who would like to get into the countryside

79
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,310
and to escape for a bit.

80
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,430
And we'll go and see some of those sites,

81
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,380
including a lake larger than Westlake, not yet quite so famous.

82
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,944
