1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,690
So to be Chinese today means being heir to both a great civilization,

2
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,610
but also heir to a millennial of environmental exploitation.

3
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,090
For all of China's problems, the Chinese today

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,680
live longer, much longer than ever before.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,642
The average lifespan of a Chinese person in 1900 was between 20 and 25.

6
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:35,770
In the middle of the 20th century, it was 41.

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,520
It is now headed toward the mid 70s.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,500
Chinese today live better, much better, than their ancestors

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,930
with more abundant food, housing, employment

10
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,830
and educational opportunities.

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,380
Today, they also die differently.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,840
A century ago, most Chinese died of infectious diseases.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,870
Now, more than half of Chinese will die of the modern diseases

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,000
of stroke, heart disease, stomach and lung cancer, and emphysema.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,080
Cancer accounts for about a quarter of deaths in China.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,570
And of the three and a half million people diagnosed with cancer each year,

17
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,610
two and a half million, sadly die, an 80% increase

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,260
in the mortality rate over the last 30 years.

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,475
Deaths due to lung cancer increased by nearly 500% over the last decades.

20
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,000
And lung cancer has become the most deadly cancer

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,530
in China, particularly in urban areas.

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,540
It is no accident that China's most modern city, Shanghai,

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,130
at the center of a major industrial region,

24
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,190
is at once China's commercial capital and its most cancerous city

25
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,940
in medical terms.

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:52,420
Heightened levels of particulate matter, both PM10 and PM2.5, in the air.

27
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,710
These have been connected to increased incidence

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,890
of neurological and respiratory diseases.

29
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,490
Beijing, Shanghai, and all major cities are now

30
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,000
seemingly permanently surrounded by a noxious haze,

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,090
while homes and workplaces are enveloped in a sweeter, but no less deadly,

32
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:17,820
smoke of cigarettes to which more than 60% of Chinese men are addicted.

33
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,340
And even as life expectancy has increased with China's modernization,

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,930
air pollution has stolen years from the lives of Chinese.

35
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,160
The former Minister of Health has estimated

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,810
that between 300,000 and 500,000 Chinese die prematurely

37
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,180
every year because of air pollution.

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,780
In the countryside, the unregulated industrial dumping

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,160
of toxins into local water has given rise

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,470
to what are called cancer villages.

41
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,730
Chinese media and internet sources have reported a total of 459 cancer villages

42
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,700
across every provincial unit of China, except Tibet and Qinghai.

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,510
And these tend to be clustered in farming communities

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,690
in areas of proximity, not surprisingly, to industry.

45
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,920
The paradoxes of these developments in the physical lives of Chinese

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,420
constitute an important historical narrative,

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,560
a story of many more people alive than ever

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,800
before, mostly living longer, living better,

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,740
moving to cities with few trees, bad air, and pour water,

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,970
dying from different diseases than those of their fathers and mothers.

51
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,610
These contradictions also pose an enormous challenge

52
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,800
for a government founded in Mao Zedong's famous words, to "serve the people."

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,328
