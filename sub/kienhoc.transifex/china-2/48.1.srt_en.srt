00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,175


3
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:14,370
Over the past three decades, we've seen an unprecedented expansion

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,590
of higher education and, in recent times, serious efforts

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,280
at reform and restructuring.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,530
But almost surely, nowhere on Earth have recent decades

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,470
seen more revolutionary change in universities

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,990
than in the People's Republic of China,

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,300
Thirty years ago, Chinese universities were just

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,350
reopening after the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,862
Today, they are poised for positions of international leadership,

12
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:46,700
in research and in education.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,940
China today is experiencing a revolution in mass higher education

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,190
that dwarfs that of the United States in the 1950s or of Europe in the 1970s.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,360
It's a revolution that began in the last years of the 20th century

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,470
and is still gathering strength.

17
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,660
We should look at it, to some degree, in historical perspective.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,960
This is not the first educational revolution in modern China.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,620
A little more than a century ago, with the end of the old examination system,

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,090
the existing structure of local schools and academies,

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,400
all linked to the civil service exams, was

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,160
displaced by a new system of public and private institutions.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,550
And at that time, here we're talking about the 19-teens,

24
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,290
and '20s, and '30s in particular, China developed

25
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,410
one of the most dynamic systems of higher education in the world

26
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,860
with strong state-led institutions, Peking University, Jiaotong University,

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,200
National Central University and, at the apogee of research,

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,780
the Academia Sinica, accompanied by a creative set of private colleges

29
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,120
and universities, Yenching University, Saint John's University, Peking Union

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,130
Medical College, to name but a few.

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,032
Sadly, all of this would be swept away in the late 1950s and 1960s.

32
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:09,539
Yet the traditions and memories of excellence have remained.

33
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,050
And they have helped to fuel more recent efforts.

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,740
In 1978, after a decade of mostly-closed universities,

35
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,740
Chinese universities enrolled, in this enormous country,

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,480
only about 860,000 students.

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,735
This number increased very gradually until about 1990

38
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:35,430
with an enrollment then of, at most, two million.

39
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,520
In the late 1990s, the government picked up this pace very dramatically.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,910
And by the year 2000, as many as six million students

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,620
were enrolled in Chinese universities.

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,150
Today, there are more than 30 million students

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,430
enrolled in Chinese universities.

44
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,100
So in the year 2000, China had about half as many students

45
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,060
in higher education as the United States had.

46
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,950
Today, it has more than twice as many.

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,960
So China is currently moving toward mass higher education.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,950
The gross enrollment ratio of 18 to 21-year-olds

49
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,130
was, for decades, in the low single digits in China.

50
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,910
The goal by 2020 is to have as many as 20%

51
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,220
of all young adults enrolled in colleges or universities,

52
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,470
with an overall longer term goal of 40% of Chinese

53
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,620
enjoying a college education.

54
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,280
Unlike the American expansion of the 1950s

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,100
and the European growth of the 1970s, this growth

56
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,130
has elements that are also self consciously

57
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,150
elitist with the aim of building a significant number of world class

58
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,530
universities.

59
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,030
What is a world class university?

60
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,700
Well, in China, it's defined as being something

61
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,190
that is a cradle of high level, creative researchers, innovators, something

62
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,430
at the frontier of science, something capable of transforming research

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,900
and innovation into higher productivity, and something

64
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,000
that will be a bridge for international and cultural exchange.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,840
Add to that end, the Chinese government and many other sources

66
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,750
are providing enormous revenues to China's leading institutions.

67
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,390
It's without question that within this decade,

68
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,029
the research budgets of China's leading universities

69
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:24,040
will approach those of the leading American and European universities

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,160
and surely that, in the realm of engineering and science,

71
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,190
Chinese universities will be among the world's leaders.

72
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,960
Now this is a welcome challenge to American universities, a challenge,

73
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
both for competition and cooperation.

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,260
Although in the latter part of the 20th century, the first part

75
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,930
of the 21st century, American universities are, as a whole,

76
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,000
viewed to be the strongest in the world.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,790
There is no reason to think that this is a permanent condition.

78
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,830
If we had rankings, university global rankings 100 years ago of the kind

79
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,700
that we have today, the leading universities in the world

80
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,100
would not have been American universities.

81
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,680
Harvard, which ranks well today, would not

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,350
have been number one, not number 10.

83
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,850
Would have been lucky to be in the top 20.

84
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,050
Probably 8 of the 10 leading universities in the world

85
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,090
would have been German universities.

86
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,970
Yet today, at least according to the rankings of the Shanghai Jiao Tong

87
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,780
University as well as the QS rankings, two

88
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,490
very important international rankings, not one of the top 45 universities

89
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,800
in the world is German.

90
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,320
Now there's a real silliness, stupidity, one should say, to this rankings game.

91
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,580
What is ranked is what can be measured, mostly in research.

92
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,520
It has little to do with education.

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,700
One criterion, citation indexes of articles.

94
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,000
These vary enormously depending on the discipline.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,330
They can be very important in economics, not so useful in history,

96
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,120
helpful in chemistry and chemical biology,

97
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,310
but without any merit whatsoever in Celtic.

98
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,240
All of the international rankings focus on research prizes

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,820
like the Nobel Prize.

100
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,160
And every university glories in having on their faculty Nobel laureates.

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,450
And they take credit in these rankings for these noble scholars,

102
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,440
even though the work that gained them a Nobel Prize

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,560
may have been given for work done decades earlier at another university.

104
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,570
The big point in these discussions of rankings

105
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,330
is not whether they're exact or correct at any one moment in time,

106
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,760
is that nothing is permanent in the world of learning.

107
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,660
All of us have progressed by learning from another.

108
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,090
Today, particularly in an era of mass higher education,

109
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,170
American and European universities share with our Chinese colleagues

110
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,940
many of these same challenges.

111
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,660
We always need to go back to a fundamental question.

112
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,380
Why do we have higher education at all?

113
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,760
And here our debate goes back, minimally,

114
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,650
to those of the 19th century to be proponents

115
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,540
of the Humboldtian idea, the German idea,

116
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,340
of bildung, the education of the whole person as distinct from ubung,

117
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,900
more practical training, differences that we might phrase

118
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,030
in Chinese as being the difference between a broad conception

119
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:27,290
of education, jiaoyu, and a narrower, repetitive one of xunlian.

120
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,475
Now there is no one right answer for every time and place

121
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:33,980
but one American tradition has been a commitment

122
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,820
to the idea of the liberal education, educating the whole person, not just

123
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,570
the specialist, educating our students to ensure

124
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,410
that they are curious, reflective, and skeptical learners, people

125
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,580
who will have the capacity for lifelong learning.

126
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,290
Because, after all, their first job will not be their last,

127
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,410
people who can develop multiple perspectives

128
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,670
on themselves and on the world, and people of whom we can

129
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,530
say, when they graduate, that they are truly independent of mind.

130
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,540
And over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, this ideal of German origin

131
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,470
has become a distinctive goal of American undergraduate education.

132
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,720
What I find encouraging about Chinese higher education today

133
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,530
is the independent understanding that the general education

134
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,880
of China's students in the arts and humanities,

135
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,280
as well as in the sciences and social sciences,

136
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,770
will be as important to their, and all of our, futures,

137
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,190
as will be their specialized and professional training.

138
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,230
General education, tong shi jiaoyu, is now

139
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,440
the cornerstone of curricular reform in leading universities

140
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,450
throughout the People's Republic, Tsinghua University, Beijing

141
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,480
University, Fudan University, Zhejiang University,

142
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,930
as well as in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

143
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,710
Chinese educational leaders, at least in the elite institutions,

144
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,020
believe they need to do this, in part, because

145
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,990
in China, as in the United States, all of the pressures

146
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,200
are in the opposite direction, on the part of students

147
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,425
who too-single-mindedly pursue their careers,

148
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:02,590
and on the part of faculty, whose careers and interests are ever

149
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,000
more specialized, leading to a situation in which students and faculty interact

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,930
on ever-narrower ground.

151
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,320
What happened in China in the 20th century in education

152
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,590
is all the more remarkable because China is home to the world's longest

153
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,330
continuous civilization with the longest continuing

154
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,420
set of philosophical and literary traditions.

155
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,230
The study of that tradition defined what it meant to be a scholar

156
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,840
but also was a path to wealth and power.

157
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,230
The Qing education and exam system brought

158
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,060
the most learned men in the realm into the service of the state,

159
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,650
not because they had been trained in statecraft or tax collection,

160
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,880
but because they would study what we would today

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,230
call the humanities, because they had studied, memorized,

162
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,920
chanted, and metaphorically consumed the classics so that they would,

163
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,080
in office, act according to the principles of human behavior

164
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,510
that the Analects, the Mencius, and other great works set out.

165
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,110
Think about it.

166
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,040
I don't think there has ever been a higher academic ideal.

167
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,470
Good people embarking on a living study of great books

168
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,240
in order to do good work in society.

169
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,866
The Qing fell in 1911.

170
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,740
But for our purposes, the more important date

171
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:24,440
is 1905, when the old exam system was ended overnight and not replaced.

172
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,770
And from that date, particularly under Republican and Communist regimes,

173
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,410
China would be governed not by a civil service chosen

174
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,760
for its proven capacities in moral reasoning,

175
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,500
but, largely, by exemplars of what we have

176
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,260
called that most dominant and successful Western export,

177
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,920
the modern, professional military in the service of another Western export,

178
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,390
a political model that was not particularly

179
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,430
sympathetic to humanist discourse, the party state.

180
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,750
After 1905, for understandable reasons, Chinese education

181
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,960
at virtually every level would drift away

182
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,150
from the humanities toward the study of those subjects that

183
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:10,460
would bring about a return to Fuqiang wealth and power, math, science,

184
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,360
engineering.

185
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,960
And within a decade of the end of the exam system,

186
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,430
the moral foundation of both Chinese government and cultural Confucianism

187
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,970
would come under a withering attack, leaving a real void

188
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,880
in the realm of human and social values.

189
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,730
By 1949, when the mainland fell to the Communists, less than 10%

190
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,040
of the graduates of Chinese public universities

191
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,220
graduated with degrees in any humanistic discipline.

192
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,260
And the Communists then took that number to the vanishing point.

193
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,180
In the absence of the humanities, there were two dominant themes in education.

194
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,980
One, by no means limited to China, was the belief that, in an age of science,

195
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,040
one could quite literally engineer a bright future, a new people.

196
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,460
This was the dream of Chinese leaders from Sun Yat-sen onward,

197
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,150
a government of technocratic expertise capable of reconstructing

198
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:08,360
China with roads, and railways, and damns, a government of huge ambition.

199
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,200
In recent years, nearly every member of the standing committee

200
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,510
of the Politburo of the People's Republic of China,

201
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,200
this small number of men who run the country,

202
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
has had training in engineering.

203
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,820
The term technocracy has been translated into Chinese

204
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,880
as the dictatorship of the engineers.

205
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,520
Not a bad description for China's most recent governments.

206
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,040
A second belief of the 20th century was that culture and the arts

207
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,340
were to be firmly subordinated to the purposes of the developmental state.

208
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,390
Under Chiang Kai-shek's New Life Movement and Mao Zedong's Cultural

209
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,670
Revolution, the humanities were mobilized

210
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,200
for the purposes of the state.

211
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,930
As Mao Zedong famously put it, literature and art

212
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,530
were to be defined as, quote, and this is a heavy phrase,

213
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:56,670
"the artistic crystallization of the political aspirations of the Chinese

214
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,590
Communist Party.

215
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,890
Well, as the great writer Lu Xun once observed, "All art may be propaganda,

216
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,910
but not all propaganda is art."

217
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,940
Chinese history in the first three quarters of the 20th century

218
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,470
shows what dislocation can ensue when a civilization loses

219
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,810
its cultural foundations, its moral compass,

220
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,990
on a relentless, if understandable, quest for wealth and power.

221
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,380
And in that quest, China imported all sorts of Western isms, scientism,

222
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,530
militarism, Leninism chief among them.

223
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,650
And it denigrated nearly every aspect of a civilization that,

224
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,830
just a century earlier, had been the most sophisticated

225
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,220
and accomplished on Earth.

226
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,570
Today, happily, in my view, a more self-confident China

227
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:48,060
is beginning to explore its past to make that past part of its modern education,

228
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,080
showing a willingness to imagine and to build institutions of learning

229
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,310
that are, of course, at the forefront of science and technology

230
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:00,250
but also honor and promote the humanities.

231
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,560
Surely, it is a positive sign that statues of Confucius

232
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,660
have, at times, although not often enough, replaced statues of Mao Zedong,

233
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,750
even though their works may be equally unread by China's youth today.

234
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,220
Perhaps the most important revolution then in Chinese higher education

235
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,950
today will not be its size or its scope, but the fact

236
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,220
that, even under the dictatorship of the engineers,

237
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,065
leading institutions have come to understand

238
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:30,470
that an education without the humanities is incomplete,

239
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,610
a recognition that, in an age that is still necessarily consumed

240
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,370
with fu qiang, with wealth and power, that, as countries vie for power

241
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,850
and that as individuals seek to accumulate wealth, an education that

242
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,120
stresses the values that make for a strong and, as Hu Jintao would say,

243
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,310
harmonious human community, are more important than ever.

244
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,020
Just weeks before he was assassinated, President John F. Kennedy

245
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,890
captured the essence of the humanities in a speech

246
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,310
he gave at Amherst College dedicating a new library.

247
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,190
He spoke about poetry but his idea applies

248
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,280
to all of the creative disciplines.

249
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,750
And this is what President Kennedy said.

250
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,910
"When power leads men toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations.

251
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,640
When power narrows the areas of man's concerns,

252
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,590
poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence.

253
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,540
When power corrupts, poetry cleanses, for art

254
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,800
establishes the basic human truths which must

255
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,310
serve as the touchstone of our judgment."

256
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,950
Well, in thinking of the challenges facing higher education

257
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:51,750
in China and in the United States in an era of common reform and renewal,

258
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,360
we need to think of our collective human experience.

259
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,010
After all, as the Chinese phrase reminds us,

260
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:07,662
shututonggui, "we have myriad paths, bout our ends are one."

261
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:21,803
