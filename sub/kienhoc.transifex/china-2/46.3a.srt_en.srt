1
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,620
So what does this landscape give the opportunity

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,790
to our friends in the CP Group?

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,480


4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,870
And who is the CP Group?

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,460
Is this a Chinese company?

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,970


7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,560
Halah?

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,960
Well, it's founded by Chinese immigrants in--

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,260
It's founded by--

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,900
By Chinese immigrant brothers in Thailand.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,420
Thailand.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,351
OK, so they're Chinese who go overseas.

13
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:39,850
Right.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,040
So technically it's an international-- well,

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,950
it's the first internationally registered company in China.

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,270
So it's a foreign company.

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,770
Is it?

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,320
I suppose you could say it's an international company.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,100
And you say it's the first-- when you say it's the first internationally

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,620
The first registered international company.

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,810
The first registered international company.

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,100
And it's actually in the case.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,470
You're right.

24
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,130
When do they invest?

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,450
Do you remember what year?

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,210


27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,200
1979?

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,600
I think late '78, early '79 in my recollection.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,557
Is it exact?

30
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:22,890
Is it precise in the case, Jake?

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,400
You-- I think it was '78.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,210
OK.

33
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,840
So the CP Group gets investor number 001.

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,460
And according to the chairman, Mr. Dhanin,

35
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,080
he got that number from Deng Xiaoping himself.

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,140
Now if I were Deng Xiaoping I would have given that number to a lot of people.

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,860
But in any event-- because China needed investors-- and so

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,050
we don't know for sure if they're the only one.

39
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,560
But they are-- so they're founded-- when does the company start?

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,015


41
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:55,515
Twenty-one.

42
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,400
1921 in Thailand.

43
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,980
They go to China in 1978.

44
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,610
And after-- the moment China reopens, the absolute moment, they reopen.

45
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:15,614
How many of you have ever been to the Super Brand Mall in Pudong?

46
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:16,780
Jonathan, you've been there?

47
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,400
OK, I see.

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,760
Jonny, did you buy anything?

49
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,282
Yeah.

50
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:22,490
actually, Caleb and I worked in Shanghai for a summer

51
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,310
and we went there every day for lunch.

52
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,400
OK.

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,470
This is a huge mall and it shows you a commitment of Chairman Dhanin to China.

54
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,810
They built this mall when they were 001.

55
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,450
They bought that land when Pudong was an idea, not a reality--

56
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,410
this new part of Shanghai.

57
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,820
And they built it where they built it because that's

58
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,054
where the ferry went across the Huangpu River.

59
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:52,970
The only way to get across the Huangpu River in those days in Shanghai

60
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,410
was to go by ferry.

61
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,980
And they built this and they put a huge amount of money

62
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,910
into building this mall.

63
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,240
And then the government moved the ferry.

64
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,327
Nevertheless, they stuck with it.

65
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:06,660
And I've always been a grateful.

66
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,430
I have to say this, and also to our ChinaX friends,

67
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,090
I've always been grateful to this mall because it started off

68
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,470
very poorly because the area wasn't developed.

69
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,100
They were first movers, but really were way ahead of the curve.

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,260
And so nobody was shopping in this mall.

71
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,040
And one time I went in to give a lecture there at the hotel nearby-- actually,

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,140
it was a Harvard Club event in Shanghai-- and I got off the plane

73
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,930
and my luggage didn't come.

74
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,480
So I had a sports coat but I had no pants,

75
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,410
or I had no pants that you could wear to a nice talk.

76
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,290
And so I went to the Super Brand Mall and in 25 minutes bought

77
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,530
a pair of pants and had it tailored and done,

78
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,750
because nobody else was in the mall.

79
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,340
So I've been always grateful that I could pull this off,

80
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,180
because I had only 50 minutes between arriving and getting some pants

81
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,640
and starting this talk.

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,760
So that's really Thai-Chinese efficiency.

83
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,970
Now it's an extraordinarily successful mall.

84
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,755
So Sachin?

85
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:09,820
It was started by brothers and began as a family business,

86
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,530
but even today, despite its globalization,

87
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,625
a lot of the upper level management still

88
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,490
has ties to those original brothers.

89
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,190
OK.

90
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,230
So it's business, so it starts really 1921 in Guangdong,

91
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:33,810
moves to Thailand, back to China in 1978.

92
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,900
It's a family business, effectively, although it has public companies.

93
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,700
It's a family organized and run business.

94
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,300
In many ways of a very traditional sort, with an extraordinary chairman.

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,340
Its main business is-- Jake, what's their main business?

96
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,500
Agriculture and animal feed.

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,130
So it starts as a feed company-- starts, actually, as a seed company.

98
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:07,600
Now it's a large feed company and very diversified agribusiness.

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
It has many other parts to it, as well, but let's focus

100
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,325
on-- so what's their model in China?

101
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,950
What are they trying to-- Emma, please.

102
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,580
They have the dragon supply chain.

103
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,790
The dragon supply chain.

104
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,095
It's a vertically integrated--

105
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:22,920
It sounds much better than the snake supply chain or something like this.

106
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,300
But yeah, it's-- so explain what a dragon supply chain is.

107
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,660
Right, so vertically integrated.

108
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,451
What does that mean, vertically integrated?

109
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:35,250
Sounds like a-- sounds fancy.

110
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,260
Yeah.

111
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,714
Vertical integration is like when you own every step in the production

112
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,880
process, as opposed to horizontal integration, which

113
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,661
is like acquiring all the companies in your same sector.

114
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:45,160
Right.

115
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,670
So you own from production down to the--

116
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,170
Right.

117
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,720
So I don't know what they call it-- feed to fork, I think.

118
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,080
Farm--

119
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,621
Farm to fork.

120
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,350
Farm to fork.

121
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,850
OK.

122
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,505
Farm to fork.

123
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:56,005
OK.

124
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,650
So they produce like-- they have the food production and then they have

125
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,670
distribution centers and they have a retail that sells the food and all

126
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,420
these things, so--

127
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,480
Is it 100% vertically integrated?

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,019
Do they own the land?

129
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,060
Caleb, what do you think?

130
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,840
I don't think so.

131
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,490
Let's see.

132
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,130
Jojo, do they own the land?

133
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,630
No.

134
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,730
Why not?

135
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,670
Because the government owns land.

136
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,690
Because the government owns land, that's right.

137
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,290
That's very good.

138
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,540
The government own-- you lost your voice in New Haven.

139
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,852
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:25,650
All right.

141
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,150
OK.

142
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,025
Do they own the land?

143
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:30,851
So how can they do it if they don't own the land?

144
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:32,650
They contract with farmers?

145
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,562
They contract with farmers, that's right.

146
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:37,020
Jake, do you want to tell us what they do with the farmers?

147
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,520
Sure.

148
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
They empower farmers to produce a staggering amount of-- in terms of,

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,569
like, for example, poultry, they can produce over 100,000 chickens

150
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,610
whereas it would be possible just to do it alone.

151
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,170
So they provide them the resources.

152
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:54,350
This could be technological, like machines, as well as specialized feed

153
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,180
that just allows for this mass production of poultry.

154
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,808
Who's feed do you think they have the farmers use?

155
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:04,000
They use the CP feed.

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,010
Their feed, of course.

157
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,970
This is a-- starts as a seed company that

158
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,490
becomes the biggest feed company in the world.

159
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:15,210
That's the kind of central artery of this business is feed.

160
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,180
But that feed then goes-- so you're a farmer-- let's see.

161
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,760
Kevin, you're a farmer and you've been raising 100 chickens a year.

162
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,090
That's not that many to be very successful.

163
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,780
What would CP give you the opportunity to do?

164
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,907
