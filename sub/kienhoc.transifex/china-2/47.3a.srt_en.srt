1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,150
Sachin.

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,994
Is it his background, like, where he came from, out of the Cultural

3
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:16,910
Revolution, and out of the Great Leap Forward,

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,240
and built this company from-- like, in pretty tough times?

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,740
Right.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,610
Part of it.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,450
You need to speak up for our global friends.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,470
But it is-- it is his background.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,510
How did somebody do this?

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,674
Jasmine?

11
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:33,960
He also seems to have very high personal ideals.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,060
He has a huge emphasis on human capital and equality.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,890
Right.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,195
Which is something that China has been rumored to be lacking.

15
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,276
For example, he sacrificed-- not sacrificed--

16
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:50,280
he was willing to give up exclusive rights with the American firm

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,200
because he believed in the quality of his auto parts.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,530
Right.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,030
Right.

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,692
He's a man of strong-- you cannot meet this man-- I have met him--

21
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,150
you cannot meet this man without understanding that you are

22
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,552
in the presence, really, of an extraordinary person.

23
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:07,640
A dynamic entrepreneur.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,840
And somebody who really has made a difference,

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,670
but will continue to make-- a person who's

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,890
100% in charge of this enterprise, even as it gets larger.

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,480
So that's another reason.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,450
I think Josh had already mentioned this.

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,450
If you're interested in business, and history,

30
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,890
this is an extraordinary business history topic.

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,970
So what are they trying to do for the first two or three

32
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,635
years of this business?

33
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:42,870
And if you don't remember, I brought you the history of the Wanxiang company,

34
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,220
published by Wanxiang.

35
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,710
It's in the form of a comic book.

36
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,210
And here's Mr. Lu.

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,920
Here's one of their native factories.

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,100
Here they are starting the company.

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,990
Here's the history of this area.

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,800
Here's Mr. Lu starting.

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,650
So anybody who wants to read the real history of Wanxiang, here.

42
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,068
Wanxiang shiye.

43
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,044
It's right there for the taking.

44
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:10,520
What do they do for the money?

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,020
Cara.

46
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,251
So they were trying to gather scrap metal, basically, to make their tools.

47
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:15,750
Right.

48
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,930
They have no tools.

49
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,510
So no state allocation in this context.

50
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,630
They have no tools.

51
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,510
They get scrap metal from whom?

52
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,720
I think this is a plow kind of blade, and from helmets from plow tractors.

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,220
Right.

54
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,553
Does it say where it comes from?

55
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:30,931
I thought it did.

56
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:31,430
Ned?

57
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,310
It says cannon barrels.

58
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,590
So there's ordnance.

59
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:42,240
There's PL-- they get scrap metal from the army in order to make, like,

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,720
tractor plows.

61
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,220
Imagine.

62
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,750
So you want to start a business, you have to find metal to make your tools.

63
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,180
You can't buy them from anywhere, even with your $500.

64
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,320
You find the metal to make your tools.

65
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,620
You get them from the army.

66
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,335
Now, ordnance metal is actually pretty high quality, right?

67
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:04,550
You're going to shoot a cannon and a shell over to Taiwan,

68
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,220
it has to be pretty good steel.

69
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,240
So they get really good steel.

70
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,810
So Julia, you have 300 pounds of steel now, in your back yard.

71
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,090
And it's 1969.

72
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,514
And your job, you-- your particular job, is to put this into tractor plows.

73
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:24,210
How do you do it?

74
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,592
Do I just guess?

75
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:26,230
Just guess.

76
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,847
Because, I mean, that's what they did.

77
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:30,930
I think, like, to start off, like, I would, like, start, like, ham-- like,

78
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,370
kind of like metallurgy.

79
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,286
You would hammer them.

80
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:33,580
Yeah, like metallurgy.

81
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,160
So here's Mrs. Lu, who is you.

82
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,630
[LAUGHTER]

83
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,270
And look what she does.

84
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,640
You can hardly see it.

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,280
Oh, so she does do it by hand.

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,500
She does it by hand.

87
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
But she welds by hand.

88
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,530
For three years.

89
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,500
Time is not money during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

90
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,330
They had nothing else to do.

91
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,640
Might as well invest in the future.

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,770
But she does this literally, taking weapons and putting them

93
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,025
into something remarkably, remarkably useful.

94
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,650
Shows you how-- kind of, what a different world we're in today.

95
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,502
Arna?

96
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,900
I thought that-- it's not very clear in the case, like,

97
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,490
how they're selling those tools that they

98
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,861
are making from the scrap metals and stuff.

99
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,611
I would only assume, since it's only four years after they founded

100
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:27,260
the company in '69, that they weren't allowed to sell SOE,

101
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,289
that they probably were selling some private arms.

102
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,234
That's how they are making their money.

103
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:32,734
Right.

104
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:33,442
But it's not so--

105
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:36,940
And the business is very unclear in the case from 1969

106
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,780
to 1973, and not by accident in some ways.

107
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,922
If you know, kind of, the more nuanced periodization

108
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:47,995
of the history of the PRC, 1969 is a horrific time

109
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,889
to think of setting up a truly private enterprise.

110
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,180
And so you might want to keep your head down for a bit.

111
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,110
1973 is a moment-- Deng Xiaoping comes back, before he's purged again.

112
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,876
It's a moment of comparative openness.

113
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:04,810
There are opportunities for enterprises to do

114
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,740
something different against the-- Sarah?

115
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,195
I have a question.

116
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:10,620
Since he's getting this metal from the army,

117
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,015
does that imply that the army or somebody powerful believes

118
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:19,350
in what he's doing, or would the army have given metal to just anybody?

119
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,010
Anybody with money, presumably.

120
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,100
So they used some of this money to get the scrap metal.

121
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,970
There's no evidence at all in the case for a kind of-- this

122
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,100
is not the Ningway military industrial complex.

123
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,940
It's founded in 1969, but it can really only do business in some serious way

124
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,057
after 1973.

125
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:37,640
OK, very good.

126
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,910
What do they then do?

127
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,450
What gets this thing going?

128
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,600
What's their take-off trick-- or take-off tool, as it were?

129
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,572
Jonathan.

130
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:53,782
After being rejected or, kind of, becoming a part of the government's,

131
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:55,740
kind of, procurement and central economic plan,

132
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,881
he smartly left some of his tools behind, as samples.

133
00:05:58,881 --> 00:05:59,380
Right.

134
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,610
And once the market for those tools grew,

135
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,470
the government discovered that his tools were of superior quality.

136
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:07,970
Right.

137
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,982
So they're making really good tools in this tiny little shack

138
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:13,690
that I'll show you a picture of later on.

139
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,630
There is a picture in the case.

140
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,820
What kind of tools are they making, Jonathan?

141
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,660
I think that they're plows.

142
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,770
They do start making tractor plows.

143
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,009
And what's the one tool that really gets them going?

144
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,800
Well, eventually, it's the universal joint.

145
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,320
All right.

146
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,125
So they get into it by making a universal joint.

147
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,800


148
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,790
So what is a universal joint?

149
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,550
I'll give you the Wikipedia definition here.

150
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,460
It's a joint or a coupling in a rigid rod

151
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,260
that allows the rod to bend in any direction.

152
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,830
And so it can send power in different directions,

153
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,910
and energy in different directions.

154
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,204
What is a universal joint?

155
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:57,745
I don't know.

156
00:06:57,745 --> 00:07:01,154


157
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,582
Actually, I don't know.

158
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:03,290
That's all right.

159
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,330
It's not a requirement.

160
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,390
It might be on the final exam.

161
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,360
All right, Kat.

162
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,225
I'm not into cars, but that's why I looked it up.

163
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:14,970
And it's actually this, kind of, like, rotating joint

164
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,960
that allows a bar to bend in different ways.

165
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,565
So there was, like, this animation on Wikipedia

166
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,900
where you see like this bar with this, like,

167
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,972
rotating joint that allows it to turn in different directions.

168
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:27,129
So I'm guessing--

169
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,170
It puts power that can go in multiple directions.

170
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,550
Chris, you want to amplify this?

171
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,770
I think Kat's spot on, but I think the application

172
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,960
is, like, it allows the car wheels to actually

173
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,075
be turned in different directions, for, like,

174
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,390
front-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive.

175
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,890
OK.

176
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,120
Yili?

177
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,930
This is a very critical part in car, especially the chassis system.

178
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:54,622
So its basic function is turn the rotation of the mechanical part

179
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:56,150
into different way.

180
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,520
So that it can use it in a steering wheel-- in the-- in wheels.

181
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,300
Right.

182
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,380
Also the case.

183
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,530
And what does Wanxiang mean in Chinese?

184
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,410
It's basically-- it's, like, multiple direction.

185
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,240
10,000 directions.

186
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,420
10,000 directions.

187
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,527
So it's basically for a universal joint.

188
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,360
So if you learn nothing else in this course,

189
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,443
you will know what a universal joint is, something

190
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:21,750
that's absolutely essential for the working of virtually every motor

191
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,310
vehicle.

192
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,800
And so they've got in there-- it's a really important part.

193
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,750
You can't do a case like this from the inside,

194
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,650
unless you have access to the company.

195
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,690
The student visits helped.

196
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,120
I was very fortunate to meet now, three or four times, with Chairman Lu.

197
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,150
I had a research associate in Hong Kong who could also follow up.

198
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,820
It's a famous company in China, so you can write about this in China,

199
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,070
even though totally unknown outside.

200
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:59,530
And of course, it has a company in the United States that one can visit.

201
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,412
Why did Wanxiang, why would Wanxiang, want to do this case?

202
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,870
They could have said no, in which case I could have done it

203
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,600
from library sources, or something of this sort.

204
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,510
What's their motivation to cooperate in writing a business school case?

205
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,891
