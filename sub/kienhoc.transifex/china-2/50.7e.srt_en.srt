00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,436


3
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:14,560
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: Because the problem is not just-- as we've been stressing

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,390
and as our program stresses-- is not just

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,360
a question of science and technology.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,692
It is fundamentally an economic question too.

7
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:22,900
When you talk about responding to these air pollution

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,652
problems and the trajectory in greenhouse gases,

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,860
you are, just for the reason that Mike is mentioning,

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,890
how central energy is in China's economy and its future,

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,820
it is a fundamentally economic challenge.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,360
So you have to think about how China responds to the air quality

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,635
and greenhouse gas emission challenges reconciled

14
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:45,900
with its need to develop economically.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,130
China has an opportunity to learn from the experiences of other countries,

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,500
including the US, over the recent decades

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,340
to come up with policies that approach and mission control that are reconciled

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,800
with economic development.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,030
And if you talk to economists, if you survey economists,

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,850
a huge majority of them will say the most efficient way

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,970
to reduce emissions is by putting a price on the emissions,

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,430
on the pollutant, on carbon.

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,890
And so we've actually, in our group, we've done a research project.

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,640
And then we have a book that just came out

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,660
that looks specifically at what it would mean for China if it were

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,270
to put a price on carbon, if it were to have

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,700
a carbon tax-- that's how we look at it-- if it were to have a carbon tax.

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,774
And what would it mean in terms of the economic development over time?

29
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,815
When you have a carbon tax, you generate revenue.

30
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:44,630
So those revenues can be used to correct for some of the distortions

31
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,140
or the inequities of the tax if need be.

32
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,660
And in general, analyses of carbon taxes in different countries

33
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:59,930
indicate that this is a very efficient way to try to reduce carbon.

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,730
In the case of our study, we then trace it

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:08,250
all the way through to what we call the co-benefits, or the ancillary benefits,

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,440
on air quality.

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,320
And in fact, this book suggests-- the analysis

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,860
in this book, which was conducted with mainly Chinese authors in partnership

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,580
with our group at Harvard-- suggests that carbon taxes at different scales

40
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,370
would have enormous impacts on air quality in China.

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,590
So they would deliver two different benefits,

42
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,155
both in terms of reducing carbon and reducing air pollution,

43
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:31,030
reducing the health impacts of air pollution,

44
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,360
reducing the number of premature mortalities

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,410
that are associated with air pollution at the same time

46
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,577
it is done in an economically efficient way.

47
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,660
And I think the Chinese government is increasingly

48
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,140
receptive to this sort of solution.

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,710
You might recall that out of the Third Plenum late last year,

50
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,010
one of the biggest things they said that came out

51
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,371
of that, for what it's worth-- I mean, it's

52
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,120
hard to interpret what the specific implications are going to be--

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,450
is we should move towards market pricing of resources.

54
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,050
And market pricing of resources can include market pricing of energy

55
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,170
with a price on environmental externalities embedded in it.

56
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,130
So that's why I think that there is an opportunity for China to lead

57
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,980
in the sense of adopting that sort of newer concept in terms

58
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,600
of environmental regulation that harnesses the market

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,595
to respond to the problems and do it in a way that can reconcile

60
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,600
with economic development.

61
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,397
And if you look at what China is doing now,

62
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:34,480
I don't know if you've heard about this, but China

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,320
is experimenting with carbon trading systems

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,747
in seven different locations in China.

65
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:43,080
I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do,

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,580
because it's very hard to implement.

67
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,790
But it is modelled on what the European Union, and California,

68
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,900
and some states in the US have done in terms of putting a price on carbon.

69
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,190
BILL KIRBY: So that's a really interesting example,

70
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,427
it seems to me, of something that hadn't occurred

71
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:00,760
to me in the environmental area.

72
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,030
But China has experimented with different economic reforms

73
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,770
through special economic zones.

74
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,180
Shenzhen, there's a new free trade zone here in Shanghai.

75
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,990
It has localized experiments over time, really over the last 35 years,

76
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,876
some of which are then taken national.

77
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:20,459
Is there a prospect-- and this gets back to my Taiwan example.

78
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,990
I realize Taiwan is only 23 million people,

79
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,030
and it probably has more wind for all I know, more typhoons.

80
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,200
But the-- and better environmental policies, but smaller

81
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,090
challenges to be sure in time.

82
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,140
But is there the prospect of provincial developments,

83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,786
kind of like how-- can you imagine a Zhejiang or a Fujian

84
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:47,230
experimenting with a quite different carbon tax that is provincial,

85
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,620
or regional, in basis and seeing if that can work?

86
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,480
Because there are regional differentiations of this problem.

87
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,884
It's much worse, it appears, in the north

88
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:58,800
than it is in the south, although it is not insignificant in the south

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,260
all the way down to Hong Kong as we've seen.

90
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,010
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: There's benefits of that and there's also risks.

91
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,968
I was actually just at a conference in Shenzhen

92
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:10,530
that was about low carbon development and included reports

93
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,810
on all the different carbon trading pilot projects in China.

94
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,339
And each one was developed locally.

95
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,630
Each one was developed locally.

96
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,283
The local, whether it was a province or a city,

97
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:26,107
the Development Reform Commission of the given jurisdiction

98
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,440
actually developed this program.

99
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,950
And they're very inconsistent.

100
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,950
They have different coverages, they're considering different industries,

101
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,864
they have different ways of allocating.

102
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:35,920
It gets very complicated.

103
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,940
Very technical stuff.

104
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,742
But there is a problem in that then you, in a sense, when

105
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,450
you do this sort of experimentation, then

106
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:48,530
you have to-- they're aiming to move-- at least there

107
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,050
is some objective of moving towards a national system.

108
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,720
But then you have to reconcile all these lobby's pre-existing systems.

109
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,250
And there are interest groups that grow up around any one of these experiments

110
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,450
then fight to keep it the way that they have it.

111
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,046
And so it gets pretty messy.

112
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:14,430
On the tax side, China has experimented also

113
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,930
with resource taxes, which are closely related to the carbon tax idea

114
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,440
that I just talked about.

115
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:29,480
They started with a resource tax in Xinjiang as a way of experimentation

116
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,237
to account for the development of the resources in certain regions

117
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:37,570
to help try and create revenues for that region that can help their development.

118
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:42,219


119
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:43,260
I think it is good to do.

120
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,968
I think it's interesting to see how China

121
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,710
does policy experiments in this realm.

122
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,940
But I do worry that when you have overlapping policies,

123
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,700
or you have different regions, that over time it

124
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,002
leads to a more chaotic national solution, or less sort of coherent.

125
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:04,160
BILL KIRBY: And sometimes we-- I think.

126
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,245
You tell me.

127
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:10,430
The United States has been fortunate in having California on its own,

128
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,670
because of our federal system, having the capacity to set standards that

129
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,070
are ahead of those of the federal government or of other states,

130
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,850
and others have to follow because the California market is so big.

131
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,180
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: It's a very unique thing.

132
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,055
It's specifically written into the Clean Air Act in the United States

133
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:26,065
that California has this unique status.

134
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:28,600
So California is allowed to do this, and other states

135
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,710
are allowed to adopt California rules if they choose.

136
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,570
BILL KIRBY: Maybe Taiwan should have a special clause in the next Clean Air

137
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,470
Act.

138
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,920
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: There's a very interesting development, though.

139
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,800
I have to tell you, which it's a reaction

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:49,510
to-- we talked about how the US just announced carbon standards for existing

141
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,200
power plants.

142
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,780
BILL KIRBY: Yes, yes.

143
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,140
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: And that was, whatever, two weeks ago.

144
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,670
BILL KIRBY: Two weeks ago.

145
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,190
President Obama.

146
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,690
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: In fact, I don't know if you noticed this,

147
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,490
but it struck me as a just very sort of Chinese policy approach.

148
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,810
It's a unique strategy in that they have designed it

149
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,600
so that each state is going to devise its own mechanism for achieving

150
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,880
the particular carbon emissions standards for its power plants.

151
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,490


152
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,850
In a sense, it's allowing every state to come up with its own solution.

153
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,980
Some of them are going to opt into a California style carbon trading system.

154
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,530
Others are going to do other things.

155
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,320
They're going to do technology mandates.

156
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,730
I think some are actually quite likely to do it, try a carbon tax.

157
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:40,740
So I don't know what it means for the long run, for US policy.

158
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:47,480
But it's kind of the political limitations of the US

159
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,340
has sort of forced the USCPA to do it in this way.

160
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,650
In fact, you can't get legislation through Congress.

161
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,200
BILL KIRBY: Right.

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,246
