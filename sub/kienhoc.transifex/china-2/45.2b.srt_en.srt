1
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:15,380
Can you talk about issues both economic and non-economic

2
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,690
that would lead to the kind of changes that

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,190
began to be ushered in late 1978-1979.

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,710
I think there was, on the part of the leadership

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,800
and ultimately the most important part of the leadership,

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,225
namely Deng Xiaoping, a sense that they had lost time

7
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:37,690
or they'd lost decades when they could've

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,500
been growing in which they really weren't doing very much, except say

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,760
in the military sphere and the like.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,850
But it wasn't a crisis.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,190
This was not a deep recession that happened in 1976-78.

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,290
The economy actually was picking up a little bit.

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,160
The biggest change, of course, is the death of Mao.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,680
And then the purge of the so-called Gang of Four,

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,680
of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and the other three

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,280
members of this radical leftist group.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,990
And that basically opened up the possibility of changing things.

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,510
And you had Deng Xiaoping, who was in some sense in the Chinese tradition

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,240
of some of the Chinese people of the past century, which

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,730
is he wanted China to be wealthy and powerful.

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,430
But he had himself no clear idea of what the changes should be.

22
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,690
He just knew that they could do better.

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,080
He, himself made visits to Sichuan, where

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,040
he was from, and looked at the extreme poverty.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,740
And then of course for the Chinese population as a whole,

26
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,510
he goes to Japan.

27
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,230
Going to US and seeing that the US is far ahead of China

28
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,920
wouldn't have been a shock to anybody in China,

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,420
because the US was assumed to be wealthy and powerful and so on.

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,520
But Japan was not.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,220
And Japan back in the 1950s, Japan wasn't all that well off.

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,300
It was better off than China by a significant fraction.

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,690
It was a bit better off than Korea and Taiwan.

34
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,480
But it was still-- only 2% of the people had automobiles, things like that.

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,520
And then you go to this Japan that Deng visits

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,740
and it's on television all over China showing

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,790
everybody with shiny automobiles and massive traffic and huge buildings,

38
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,600
and everything looking wealthy, and so on.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,070
And that was a real shock to the Chinese, at least

40
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,610
the more educated part of the population.

41
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,450
And so there was a lot of interest in trying

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,140
to get growth and get things going faster.

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,310
No, as I say, no real idea of how to do it.

44
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,290
And no real idea of just how much growth they could get.

45
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,650
And that then starts-- one further point here,

46
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,160
Deng Xiaoping is critical in this because certain things

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,060
they would have done whether he was there or not.

48
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,980
Opening up to foreign trade.

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,320
The leftists had criticized anybody who used foreign technology.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,050
Mao had talked about how all peasants can do

51
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,210
as well as scientists in laboratories on finding new technologies or whatever.

52
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,220
And so getting rid of that kind of attitude was critical to any change.

53
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,090
But once the Gang of Four were out, there

54
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,540
was an immediate effort to turn outward to get foreign technology.

55
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,550
And the problem was they basically said to the various industrial enterprises

56
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,280
and others, OK, you can go now buy foreign technology.

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,970
And so there's this huge movement on these enterprises

58
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,500
to go buy foreign technology.

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,630
One of the Hong Kong banks tried to do a calculation

60
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,190
of how many letters of intent to purchase had been signed.

61
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,280
And it was something like $500 or $600 billion worth of things.

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,760
Well, China had exports of just under $10 billion,

63
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,640
the foreign exchange to pay for it.

64
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
So there was no way they were going to get anywhere.

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,100
So then you had to think about where are you going to get the foreign exchange?

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,780
Well, you're going to have to either export--

67
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,530
and then the question is what are you going to export?

68
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,290
For a little while in the late '70s they hoped they could export oil.

69
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,020
This is right after the oil shocks of the mid '70s.

70
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,840
Right, and the prices were up.

71
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,840
And they invited the oil companies in to explore, particularly the offshore oil.

72
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,500
They had a little bit of oil in the Daqing field and then in Western China,

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,230
and so on.

74
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,600
But then when the initial efforts to find oil offshore

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,780
were not very successful, they clearly weren't

76
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,150
going to solve their foreign exchange problems that way.

77
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,610
And then what was left, pretty much, was manufacturing.

78
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,800
And so they started down the road of manufacturing exports.

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,920
It was very similar to how Korea and Taiwan reached the same conclusions,

80
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,830
but they reached them back in the early '60s.

81
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,540
China reached them only in the '78, '79, '80 era.

82
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,270
It could have turned out differently.

83
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,230
There was another major figure at the time, Chen Yun, who was certainly--

84
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,940
he wasn't as powerful as Deng Xiaoping.

85
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,740
He didn't have the military ties that were as close as Deng.

86
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,370
But he was certainly the second most powerful person in China,

87
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,290
particularly with regard to economy at that time.

88
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,790
And he was still a believer in central planning and command economy.

89
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,600
But what happens then, is they go into this period of the '80s

90
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,320
and of course Chen Yun is playing an important role at this time.

91
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,400
But Deng Xiaoping is watching what these experiments going on

92
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,680
in Sichuan province with the provincial, I

93
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,830
guess he was party secretary, Zhao Ziyang.

94
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,410
And he's the de-collectivization and going back to household agriculture

95
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,330
leading to a boom in agriculture, things like that.

96
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,140
And he'd had experience with this in the early '60s.

97
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,610
To get out of the famine they'd gone back to household agriculture.

98
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,410
As a result, Deng Xiaoping got very severely criticized.

99
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,170
And that was why he was purged from leadership for quite a time.

100
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,970
So they brought Zhao Ziyang to Beijing as prime minister.

101
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,920
And those reforms in agriculture began to really spread.

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,440
It was a bottom-up affair, but with the top leaders

103
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,760
at critical points saying go ahead.

104
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,550
At that time they still thought they were

105
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,470
trying to improve central planning and the command economy.

106
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,810
They weren't trying to move toward a market economy.

107
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,220
So the first two things they did were this opening up to foreign trade,

108
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,880
which meant big promotions of exports, and then

109
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,870
the decollectivization of agriculture.

110
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,550
And both were wildly successful.

111
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,910
And that left that just-- set the whole tone for, gee,

112
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,920
maybe we can do a lot of other things.

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,390
So there's several things one can think about.

114
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,310
First of all, you have a government that, in some sense,

115
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:17,900
goes ahead by undoing some of the Maoist era policies by collectivization.

116
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,040
They go back to family farming as a kind of foundation,

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,410
even if the farmers still don't own the land,

118
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,920
nevertheless they have control over its output.

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,770
So some of it is by undoing.

120
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,250
Some of it, then, is perhaps by direct learning.

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,280
What has happened in Taiwan?

122
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,810
What has happened in Korea?

123
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,720
Is there an area of real innovation in this realm?

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,900
Something that would be unexpected out of the East Asian playbook

125
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,130
from other countries?

126
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:50,800
I think most of the learning from Korea and Taiwan comes a little bit later.

127
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,760
It certainly was there.

128
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,430
I remember early on meeting with some Chinese delegations.

129
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,065
And I had done some work on the Korean economy.

130
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,110
And they were very interested in the books

131
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,920
we did in earlier studies of what the Korean economy had done.

132
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,850
But in that first phase I would say the critical things were

133
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,960
you had one, Deng, who was open to anything that worked.

134
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,300
You had Zhao Ziyang, who was open to all kinds of ideas.

135
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,190
He wanted ideas.

136
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,880
He had two-- what were seen later and to some degree

137
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,790
you could say then-- were quite radical thinktanks.

138
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,210
The Systems Reform Institute and then the Rural Development

139
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,070
Group, headed by a man named Du Runsheng.

140
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:44,360
And they then began experimenting with much more radical reforms.

141
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,560
Initially it was mostly agriculture, not only to go back

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,080
to household agriculture, but to free up rural markets.

143
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,690
And to not entirely remove the state quotas for purchases and so on,

144
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,290
but to basically move toward more market distribution.

145
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,450
So that leads to this big jump in rural incomes.

146
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:11,180
It's not until '84 that they actually begin to tackle the urban scene,

147
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,170
and particularly to tackle industry.

148
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,030
At that point the general--

149
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,080
State-owned industries.

150
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,260
State-owned industries, everything's state-owned for the most part.

151
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,045
I mean there are some, what they call, collectively owned firms,

152
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:26,040
and we'll get back to that in a moment.

153
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,850
But they tried the kinds of things that eastern European countries did, not

154
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,400
terribly successfully.

155
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,800
You could slightly improve the performance of the state enterprises

156
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,420
by changing the incentives for the management and so on.

157
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,540
But the reality was you didn't go very far in that regard.

158
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:50,010
Then in 1984, they went to actually freeing up

159
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,610
large part of industrial inputs.

160
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,030
And the idea was that they would then-- and then there

161
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,300
would be a market for these inputs, and anybody

162
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,300
could purchase them at the market price.

163
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,980
Market price was much higher than the state price in this case.

164
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,680
So the state enterprise insisted on keeping the state prices for them.

165
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,340
So you've got this dual price system which will cause trouble later.

166
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,870
But for everybody else, you could purchase input.

167
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,040
And they had had in the '70s a development

168
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,100
of what they called rural small scale industry.

169
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,430
And so there were a lot of little industries in the countryside, quite

170
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,270
a number also in the cities, sort of small, collective enterprise.

171
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,700
These and others like them had gained experience with management

172
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,466
and the availability of inputs.

173
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,590
In the past they had to go to the central planners.

174
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,690
They had to apply.

175
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,380
They were way down on the priority list.

176
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,070
They hardly ever got anything.

177
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,610
Now, all they had to do was go buy the things.

178
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,150
And so there was a huge boom in what came to be called township and village

179
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,660
enterprises, which actually is what carries the GDP

180
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,840
growth and the industrial growth for the next 7, 8, 10 years.

181
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,780
These changes don't improve the state enterprise performance much.

182
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,490
Basically they probably improve it a little bit.

183
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,400
But the state enterprises are still living off the subsidies

184
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,870
through the lower prices.

185
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,440
And then they get credits from the banks.

186
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,090
But you're basically moving without really

187
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,350
being conscious of what your fully doing, that is,

188
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,960
what the government was fully doing.

189
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,130
They're moving toward a market economy.

190
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,310
Some of the radical thinktanks clearly understood that.

191
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,620
But most of the people in the leadership, I think,

192
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,900
did not fully understand how fast this was going.

193
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:52,960
