00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,640


3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,230
So is there something in the reforms package, as it were, of the 1980s

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,140
that contributes to this really great national crisis in 1989.

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,790
Yes, some people, I think, take a somewhat simplistic view of it

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,000
and say, oh, well, gee, the market reforms and so on created corruption.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
That's not really accurate.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,740
What created corruption was that the restrictions

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,140
on getting rich and spending your money were removed.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,480
To get rich is glorious, and so on.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,090
During the Cultural Revolution people deliberately dressed

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,460
as badly as possible most of the time.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,420
And women, especially, cut their hair to be as unattractive as possible.

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,080
And no one acknowledged having goods.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,370
I mean, the Red Guards had destroyed many of the small luxuries

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,350
that a few people had.

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,670
That all changes, of course.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,270
On top of that, you no longer have everything

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,700
controlled by the central planners.

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,710
But you still have regulations all over the place.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,590
And to get ahead, you have to have the government helping you.

22
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,710
You had to get permissions and licenses.

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,225
If you get officials, they can make money doing this.

24
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:23,350
And one of the things they could also make money on

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,150
was the dual price system.

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,560
If you had the political clout to get some of the low priced goods that

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,030
were for the state enterprises, if you could get a hold of them,

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,050
all you had to do is resell them on the market.

29
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,220
And you could get very rich.

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,580
And so there was certainly the public, I think,

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,840
saw the market reforms as being the cause of the corruption.

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,185
The urban population, certainly, a lot of them,

33
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:54,450
very upset with the corruption, so that was one problem.

34
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,910
The other problem was inflation, and the freeing up of prices together

35
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,720
with not reforming the state-owned enterprises.

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,449
So the state enterprises were still borrowing money from the banks,

37
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,950
whether they could pay it back or not, borrowing huge amounts, expanding.

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,060
And in fact, in the past, the Central Plan,

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,120
the State Planning Commission would restrict

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
what they could borrow and would tell them what they could expand.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,070
In fact, they had separate companies to do the expansion of their capacity.

42
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,840
The individual enterprise could not do it.

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,900
So these restrictions were removed.

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,320
And the state-owned enterprises then begin expanding and borrowing

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,270
huge amounts of money whether it made any sense or not.

46
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,290
And this was the beginning of several bad things, one of which

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,570
was the huge buildup of nonperforming loans begins happening in the late '80s

48
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,402
and continues into the '90s.

49
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:51,860
And then you have a banking crisis.

50
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,690
But we'll get to that in a bit.

51
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,720
But the short run impact is the prices begin to take off.

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,400
And this is a country that had no price increases before '79, '80

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,550
for almost 20 years.

54
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,560
I mean, there was a jump in prices during the famine period of years,

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,530
but other than that, it was flat.

56
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,200
Now, that was because the prices were controlled.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,730
When the prices would have gone up, they stayed down and you just got shortages.

58
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,490
And therefore, you had rationing for all kinds of things.

59
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,870
But then you started going up.

60
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,110
I have the chart shows the inflation rate.

61
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,980
And it goes up.

62
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,110
It's 18% or more.

63
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,390
And for people that were on what they thought

64
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,800
were fairly fixed incomes-- in fact, their incomes

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,560
are rising at this point-- but they see these prices going up

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,470
and particularly the prices of necessities

67
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,960
and so on, they get very nervous.

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,370
So that also played a major role.

69
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,760
That's not, by any means, the whole story of Tiananmen.

70
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,600
You have to go into all kinds of issues why did the students do what they did,

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,830
and what were the values of the students,

72
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,250
and all those kinds of things, which I think

73
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,950
takes us far beyond the discussion of the economy.

74
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,890
But the economic situation did contribute.

75
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,900
And then you get the huge reaction.

76
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,160
And then you get the conservatives back in control for a time.

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,451
