Money, Politics and the Chinese Dream

1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,320
You write in “Ten Words” that the country

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,000
that used to be run by politics is now run by money

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,560
Can you explain?

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,560
China is such a rapidly changing country

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,560
There are now more changes, this country changes too fast

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:41,840
“China in Ten Words” was written four years ago in 2010,

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,560
even in those four years a lot of change has taken place.

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,360
It’s like this, its history is really fascinating.

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,800
From the Cultural Revolution to the early 1980s

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,880
China was a country in which politics ruled everything.

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,760
From the 1990s on, when the economic revolution took place,

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
money ruled everything.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,840
Recently,

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
after the emphasis on money brought on large amounts of corruption

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:25,880
especially in the last one or two years, China is no longer just focused on economics, politics has come back,

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:34,400
so now it's a combination of money and politics.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,160
I have always lived in China

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,680
so I know things a little bit

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,640
After President Xi Jinping took office

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,160
he took a really strong stance on everything

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,640
he took a strong stance against corruption, caught a lot of people

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:09,440
at the same time he enacted really strict policies against local government,

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
a lot of local government officers are really afraid of him.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
He also controlled media very harshly

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,920
the control is even more strict than in

26
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,080
the Hu Jintao era and even Jiang Zemin era.

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:35,240
He has taken politics, that is, people feel that politics is becoming important again in daily life

28
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,520
However, a very interesting thing is the very strong stances that Xi Jinping took

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,720
are largely supported as far as I know.

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,880
A lot of intellectuals who believe in liberalism

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,480
even support Xi Jinping.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,720
Xi Jinping's oppression of democratic liberalism

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,840
he still has lots and lots of people's support

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
so the situation I wrote about in “Ten Words” is not true anymore

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,000
Even though only four years have passed, China today is no longer the China I wrote about in "Ten Words"

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,840
Money is not the only ruler in China

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,040
It has already become an amalgamation of politics and economics.

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,920
This is a hopeful sign?

39
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,360
I have to take some more time to see how this policy plays out.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,560
I can tell you a little story about it.

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,120
I have a column in the New York Times.

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,720
When the "eight-point" code was issued by Xi Jinping to censor officials' banqueting, drinking and entertainment

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,720
after the edict came out the editors at the New York Times asked me

44
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,120
to write an article to comment on it.

45
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
That was last year.

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:01,120
However, I told them "I need some time to think about it, if I am to make it meaningful.

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,480
I have to see how the local government, the government officials,

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,480
actually cope with this policy.

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,360
How are they going to secretly going to eat, drinking entertain themselves?"

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,840
However, one year has passed since then

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,080
I haven't seen this phenomenon come back again.

52
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
All the local government officers have been really careful,

53
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,360
they've stopped going out eating and drinking.

54
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,880
So I really don't know right now

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:37,560
At least the really strict policies implemented by Xi Jinping have lasted longer than his predecessors'

56
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:45,440
as far as I know, meaning that of Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin.

57
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,840
Xi Jinping speaks of the China dream,

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,920
Chinese dream, and nobody seems to know just what he means.

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I want to ask you, what is your Chinese dream?

60
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,240
I actually used to go online and search for "China dream"

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
to find out what it actually means -

62
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,400
there was a very long description afterwards

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,840
and actually I don't understand it

64
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
After this China dream thing came out

65
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,520
a friend of mine called me and said

66
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,440
"oh you know everyone is talking about the dream of China.

67
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,400
I also have a dream”

68
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,640
and this friend said, "before I die,

69
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,520
I want to vote for the president of China,

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,800
and he asked me "does this count as my Chinese dream?"

71
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
and I told him on the phone

72
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,800
"Even if it doesn't count as a China Dream, it was a dream made in China."

73
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,360
so my understanding of the Chinese Dream is a dream made in China.

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,560
We speak of this ongoing revolution,

75
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,520
this sort of permanent revolution taking different forms

76
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,240
and always the problem is that it's top-down,

77
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,480
it's not democratic, second, that it's violent,

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,480
driven by at least the threat of violence

79
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
and sometimes massive loss of life,

80
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,400
and third, that it's not true, that it's not transparent,

81
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,680
that we can't see it honestly

82
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,280
How does a great nation break that habit or change?

83
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,600
Where does it begin?

84
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,040
I couldn't really see a way out of this,

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,120
the civilization of the world has been going on for a long time

86
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,880
there are only two ways, two political styles that we can take.

87
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,840
One is Parliamentary democracy

88
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
everyone votes

89
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,040
the other is a democratic monopoly.

90
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,720
I can't say that China is not democratic now, there are lots of places where China is democractic, but

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,040
but it is a democratic monopoly.

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,880
These two types of democracy, you do not have a third choice.

93
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,320
You can only choose one option out of these two

94
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:03,880
It is not likely that a Western parliamentary democracy will manifest anytime in the near future.

95
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,640
As for our Chinese democratic monopoly, how can it be better? I currently still cannot see a way.

96
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,560
…so?

97
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:20,240
So we can only let time decide the destiny of China.
