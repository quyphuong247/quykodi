00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,440
When, in August of 1945, Japan was suddenly defeated and then

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,470
compelled to give up its colonies, there was no question

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,790
among the Allied powers that Taiwan would be returned from Japan to China,

4
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,540
now the Republic of China, which have been established

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,720
upon the demise of the Qing in 1912.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,170
And if the inhabitants of Taiwan had any other wish, nobody asked them.

7
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,140
Taiwan was thus returned to a Nationalist Chinese government

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,330
that had not existed in 1895.

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,320
That government, the Republic of China, had just

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,350
fought a war of national survival against the Japanese empire

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,990
for eight years.

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,280
When it took over the island, it did so with a healthy dose of skepticism

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,390
about the loyalty of Taiwan's inhabitants.

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,170
From the outset therefore, the relationship between the Taiwanese--

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,610
as it were, those already on the island-- and Chinese nationalists

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,320
was rocky.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,010
The Taiwanese had acquired an assortment of Japanese cultural and linguistic

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,662
habits that made them seem to the Nationalists like traitors.

19
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,370
From the islanders' perspective, however,

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,660
the Nationalists, many of the most visible of whom

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,890
were conscripts soldiers from all parts of the mainland,

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,190
seemed much more like occupiers than liberators.

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,940
The Nationalists, who were suspicious of Taiwanese political loyalty

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,920
and eager to develop Taiwan as an engine of growth for the Chinese mainland,

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,760
resorted to heavy taxation and other strategies to extract resources.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,700
Japanese industries were nationalized, mainland engineers

27
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,390
displaced their Taiwan counterparts in running them.

28
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,430
And in February and March of 1947, the Nationalists

29
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,760
responded to an island wide series of protests with military action.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,389
Thousands of Taiwan's elite were executed.

31
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,110
Martial law was declared, and it would stay in effect for 40 years.

32
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,830
The brutality and subsequent cover up of the events of 1947

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,790
meant that the story of Taiwan's first reunification with the mainland

34
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,890
would cast a heavy shadow over any prospect of a second.

35
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,300
More than anything else, 1947 would begin

36
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:40,060
the creation of a distinctly Taiwanese, as opposed to Chinese or Japanese,

37
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,610
identity.

38
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:48,171
