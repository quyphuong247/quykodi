00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:07,650


3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,710
Well, Liz, you brought up Chairman Mao.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,316
And Chairman Mao, it strikes foreigners, when they come to China,

5
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:17,190
they're not surprised to see his famous portrait at Tiananmen Square.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,720
Most people know to expect it there.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,180
But they are often surprised to see the enduring

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,320
statues of Chairman Mao in various parts of the country.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,000
Especially in Shanghai.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,060
Especially in Shanghai, for example.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,560
Indeed.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,060
Indeed.

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:40,220
If one goes to Kashgar in the far northwest, on the old Soviet border,

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,160
you have an enormous statue of Chairman Mao, with this back to the Muslim city,

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,010
facing Beijing.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,110
It's really quite a statement.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,370
You have still on some university campuses,

18
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,220
statues of Chairman Mao that tower over the campus.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,020
I once asked-- this was some years ago-- a Chinese university president,

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,660
why do you still have a statue of Chairman Mao on your campus?

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,730
And he said to me quietly, well, we missed our chance

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,320
to take it down in the 1980s.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,360
So we don't see many statues of Lenin or Stalin in the former Soviet space,

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,820
or in Eastern Europe, none at all, virtually, today.

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,310
And yet we still see the founder of the People's Republic, who was himself

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,860
a close follower of Stalinism, in his youth

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:40,030
and followed many Soviet methods in establishing the country in the 1950s.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,760
You've written about images of a younger, romantic Mao, the image of Mao

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,020
at Anyuan, and have put it in the context of how

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,790
one thinks of Mao in history and memory, but also

31
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,420
in contemporary political terms.

32
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,650
And I'd you to comment a bit on this, first of all, this remarkable book

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,210
that you've written on Mao at Anyuan and then

34
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,810
on what you think the lessons for that are for our contemporary understanding

35
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,280
of China's understanding of Chairman Mao.

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,470
Well, of course, I'm always delighted to talk about my own work

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,340
and always delighted to talk about Anyuan,

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,550
which is a somewhat obscure coal mine, located in the middle of China.

39
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,100
But happens to be a place where Chairman Mao, when he was very young, just

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,820
beginning his revolutionary activities, was

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,070
joined by several of the other early leading lights of the Chinese Communist

42
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,130
Party, Liu Shaoqi, who later became Mao's competitor,

43
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,650
and rival, and victim in the Cultural Revolution;

44
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,720
Li Lisan, who was, before Mao, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party;

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,340
and so forth.

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,440
So it was an amazing site of early communist labor mobilizing

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,700
in the 1920s.

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,780
One of the reasons that I enjoyed doing the study of Anyuan

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,330
is that it did take me back to the very earliest days of the Chinese Communist

50
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:03,830
Party.

51
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:10,110
Their very earliest and most idealistic moment, a period before

52
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,390
there was a military force to actually support the Communist Party.

53
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,850
And therefore, the communists had to use their own charisma, charm,

54
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,540
and the appeal of their message in order to mobilize people.

55
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,900
They didn't have what Mao would later say is the basis of political power,

56
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,190
namely the barrel of a gun.

57
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,210
So it's a very interesting period.

58
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,320
And in that early period, it was quite striking to me,

59
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,070
in studying the communist efforts at Anyuan, how creatively they

60
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:48,800
used different elements of both Chinese and foreign cultural resources.

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,250
So Mao and the others appeared as Confucian schoolteachers.

62
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,820
Actually Li Lisan, one of the early leaders of the party, father

63
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,570
was a Confucian degree holder.

64
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,720
And he had been a Confucian schoolteacher

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,380
before he went to Anyuan to teach the classics to the workers there.

66
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,590
Mao himself was teaching in Changsha, at the normal school, as his day job.

67
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,050
So these early communist leaders presented themselves

68
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,640
really as teachers, as scholars, as part of a Confucian elite tradition.

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,250
But also very, very creatively used a number

70
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,430
of different elements of Chinese folk culture and folk tradition

71
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,130
in order to inspire the workers and convince them

72
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,390
that what they were doing, although it was, as you mentioned,

73
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,040
in fact imported directly from the Soviet Union,

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,690
that somehow it was in conversation with and resonant with certain traditions

75
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,750
and strains in Chinese culture.

76
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,980
It's been quite interesting.

77
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,360
In recent years, there has been a kind of rediscovery

78
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,150
of the romance of the young Mao in China.

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,397
A recovery with the help of the central propaganda department.

80
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:00,897
Right.

81
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:02,180
Right.

82
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,520
Which has been centrally involved in producing

83
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,730
a series of movies, television shows, and other media

84
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:19,400
that highlight Mao's early activities, before he became a revolutionary

85
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,900
with a guerrilla army, up in the mountains.

86
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,210
And it's a picture of a young Mao that seems

87
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,200
to have a lot of appeal to many people in China today

88
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,490
because it's a picture of a young Mao who was highly nationalistic,

89
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:47,680
who was trying to mobilize ordinary Chinese for educational purposes

90
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
initially.

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,590
As I said, they went as schoolteachers and founded schools for workers.

92
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,770
And then used those schools as a basis for a labor movement

93
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,750
and for very gradually building communist cells among workers.

94
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,120
In Mao's mind already, I think, was a kind of utopia of the Soviet Union

95
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,160
and the hope that China could become another Soviet Union.

96
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,730
But he immediately appreciated that it would

97
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,730
be necessary to present this kind of message in a very Chinese way.

98
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:25,950
And what's interesting about Mao, when you think about the demise of communism

99
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,100
across Eastern Europe and so on, much of the collapse

100
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,290
of communism in Eastern Europe had to do with countries

101
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,070
deciding that communism was really alien to their national traditions.

102
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,600
And that the communist leaders were traitors to their national traditions.

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,940
They were not reflective or representative of them.

104
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,520
And in much of Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union,

105
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,910
the collapse was according to kind of national or ethnic lines,

106
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,670
as people reclaimed a sense of their past

107
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,870
and what they considered to be somehow their authentic history

108
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,930
and their authentic culture.

109
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,460
Mao, by having from the very beginning, very consciously cultivated an image

110
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,280
as a Chinese nationalist patriot.

111
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,130
And then being, unlike in the former Soviet Union, not only

112
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,370
the leader of the revolution, like Lenin in Russia,

113
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,230
but also the leader of the communist state

114
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,780
as it developed its sinews use of power, like Stalin,

115
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,370
in the Soviet Union, Mao sort of combined

116
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,950
in himself both the image of a young, nationalist, revolutionary firebrand

117
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,450
and at the same time a mature communist leader

118
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,190
who presided over a very powerful state.

119
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,030
And so he is an image of nationalism to most Chinese.

120
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,500
He is an image of Chinese strength.

121
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,410
He is also an image of Chinese tradition.

122
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,580
His propensity to spout earthy aphorisms, when

123
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,200
that seemed appropriate; his use of a Chinese calligraphy

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,380
penned to write poetry, when that seemed appropriate.

125
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,320
He wielded a variety of cultural weapons that

126
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,930
are associated with political power in the Chinese tradition.

127
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,400
He did so very skillfully.

128
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,720
And so his image, I would say, is an exceedingly complicated one in China.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,040
There are many intellectuals who detest him and everything he stands for.

130
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,210
There are others, intellectuals, who think very highly of him

131
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,409
and who, in my view, tend to romanticize many of his contributions

132
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,450
in the Cultural Revolution and before that.

133
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,610
Among ordinary people, the images are also quite mixed.

134
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,430
Having done research for the last six, seven years in Anyuan,

135
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,370
which is really in the center of China proper, it was quite surprising to me,

136
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,150
when I first went there, how again and again, when people would first

137
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,520
see a foreigner-- I was the only foreigner that I ever saw wandering

138
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,290
around Anyuan in the time that I was there-- often the very first question

139
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,050
would be, what do you think of our Chairman Mao?

140
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,570
That was what they were most proud of in Anyuan.

141
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,970
And it was their Chairman Mao because he had been there for a bit.

142
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,690
And he was the one who had made Anyuan famous.

143
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,830
And you can buy Mao paraphernalia all over the place.

144
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:36,050
And I heard nothing but warm feelings for him on the part of poor people

145
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,000
and on the part of quite well-off people alike.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,300
But I also spend a lot of time in the cities of China

147
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,740
and on university campuses in China.

148
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,390
And there, you often find very, very different images of him.

149
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,740
So it's a very complicated legacy.

150
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,560
But I think it's a legacy that it's impossible for the current leadership

151
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,910
in China to walk away from.

152
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,830
That it was Mao's revolution that put a very strong Chinese Communist Party

153
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,840
in place in China.

154
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,630
And the current leadership, Xi Jinping, is a so-called princeling.

155
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:22,450
He has his position because his father was a revolutionary comrade of Mao's.

156
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,270
And for this generation, this generation of the children of the revolutionaries,

157
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,480
their political legitimacy is very closely

158
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,300
intertwined with and dependent upon that of the revolution and Mao

159
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,480
as the acknowledged leader of that revolution.

160
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,520
So I think it's a very complicated legacy.

161
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,880
And it's different in different places.

162
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,490
It's different among different age groups.

163
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,010
It's different among different social classes.

164
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,110
But it's also extremely different from the situation in the former Soviet

165
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,470
Union or Eastern Europe.

166
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,120
And therefore, I believe that looking at the history

167
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,900
of the collapse of communism in those other regions of the world

168
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,820
does not give us a very good handle on what's likely to happen in China.

169
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,940
I was thinking-- two thoughts came to mind as you were speaking.

170
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,000
Of course, the hometown hero aspect in Anyuen, and even though that--

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Sure.

172
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,000
Sure.

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,649
--that wasn't really his hometown.

174
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,190
Some interesting things when one thinks of different legacies

175
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,840
in different parts of China.

176
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,488
I was at Zhejiang University and was hosted by the Jiang Jieshi yu jindai

177
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:35,790
zhongguo yanjiu zhongxin, the research center

178
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,040
for the study of Chiang Kai-Shek in modern China.

179
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,530
I was surprised to see this.

180
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,470
But it was in Chiang Kai-Shek's home province

181
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,780
of Zhejiang, a remarkable research institution.

182
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,660
And they took me to Chiang Kai-Shek's hometown.

183
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,890
The place that really was his hometown.

184
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,530
Fenghua.

185
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,830
Fenghua, at Xikou, Fenghua, where he is, without question, a hero.

186
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,860
Indeed.

187
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,850
And indeed, this may not have happened to you at Anyuan.

188
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,240
I actually met Chiang Kai-Shek.

189
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,200
I met him too.

190
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,150
I was just there in Fenghua myself, more recently than you.

191
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,910
I failed to have myself memorialized in this way.

192
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,070
But I also did meet him and shook his hand.

193
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,580
Right.

194
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,140
He's really still a formidable figure.

195
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,680
It's extraordinary that he's so well preserved and so vibrant really.

196
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,180
Incredible.

197
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,403
Really.

198
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:25,072
Really.

199
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,432
He's actually looking better than Chairman Mao does

200
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:30,640
under glass in Beijing.

201
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,890
Chinese modern history is, in many ways, told,

202
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,490
but not warmly, as also the history of great personalities.

203
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,260
What do you think might happen-- one of the differences in the Soviet case

204
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,040
and China's case minimally is-- and I agree with you,

205
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,410
the circumstances are quite different-- but Khrushchev did denounce Stalin.

206
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,770
There is a multi-decade process of de-Stalinization.

207
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:05,080
Still the Soviet Union would last another 30 something years after that.

208
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,350
Basically try to survive without that central figure of its founding.

209
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,370
What can we imagine are the possibilities when Chinese historians--

210
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,470
historians in China, not people like ourselves-- can truly

211
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,790
write the history of the purges of the early 1950s;

212
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,660
the history of the Anti-Rightist Movement in great detail;

213
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,530
and above all, the history of the Great Leap Forward,

214
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,170
with its perhaps 40 or more million deaths,

215
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,720
even before the Cultural Revolution?

216
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,330
This is a history of loss of life without parallel,

217
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:47,240
even on the part of Stalin or Hitler, in terms of absolute loss of life.

218
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,140
And what do you think that will be?

219
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,680
I mean what are some of the possibilities?

220
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,100
Well, I think precisely because, as you're

221
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,770
suggesting, this history is so fraught with political danger

222
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,550
for the legitimacy of the party, that that kind of freedom

223
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:11,010
to really explore and write objectively and without political restraint

224
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,850
about the history of the party or about Mao's involvement in it,

225
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:21,140
is very unlikely to come in China while the Communist Party is still in power.

226
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,110
I think the Chinese Communist Party has reached the determination

227
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,140
that Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956

228
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,490
was the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union,

229
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,130
even though, as you mentioned, the Soviet Union continued still,

230
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,700
all the way up until 1991.

231
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,750
But nonetheless, from the verdict that I believe

232
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,530
has been embraced as the official verdict

233
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,740
from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,

234
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,670
the real unraveling for the Soviet Union began

235
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,670
with Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin.

236
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,900
It was an electrifying moment around the communist world at the time.

237
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,020
You had the Hungarian Revolution.

238
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,650
You had uprisings in Poland and elsewhere.

239
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,170
You had, in China, the Hundred Flowers Movement,

240
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:13,900
which was Mao's response to what he saw as a crisis in the Soviet Union

241
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,420
and Eastern Europe, of alienation between party and intellectuals

242
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,850
in an effort to overcome that.

243
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,730
Of course, it didn't serve to overcome it in his view.

244
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,520
And then it was followed by the very brutal Anti-Rightist campaign,

245
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,530
with the state clamped down on those intellectuals who'd

246
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,370
taken the invitation to speak their minds.

247
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,150
But I think as the Chinese Communist Party looks

248
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,920
at that history in the former Soviet Union,

249
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,350
it views that denunciation of Stalin as a critical turning point

250
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,800
that delegitimized the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

251
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,500
And it has made a clear determination that it

252
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,080
doesn't want to go down that path.

253
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,270
So I really don't think we're going to get the kind of open history

254
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,930
that you're talking about until the party is gone,

255
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,550
or at least gone as being the only party in town.

256
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,840
That's not to say that there isn't amazing scholarship being

257
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,040
done by some very talented historians in the PRC today,

258
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,770
who are doing everything they can to push the envelope, who have access

259
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:28,830
to archival materials that were unavailable in previous years,

260
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,150
and who are using those archives and often oral histories

261
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,820
and a whole variety of other sources to try to write as boldly as they can

262
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,210
about the history of the PRC.

263
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,500
But I don't really think that their work is

264
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,530
going to play a major role in delegitimizing the party because I

265
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,940
think the party will maintain a very tight control over the publication

266
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,620
of those kinds of materials.

267
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:09,270
