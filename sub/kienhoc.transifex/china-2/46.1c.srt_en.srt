1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:16,580
One other thing that's worth-- is it a productive system, Chinese agriculture?

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,660
Not very productive.

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,130
Why would you say that?

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,052
Because the plots are so small, or what?

5
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:24,426
There wasn't really a possibility for a economy of scale.

6
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:27,490
And also, I guess there wasn't utilization

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:33,170
of technology in pre-1949 agriculture.

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,360
There wasn't as much utilization of technology,

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,910
as would begin in the 18th and 19th century--

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,600
but only then, we have to remember, in Europe.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,020
So is this large population fed?

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,540
This population grows larger and larger.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,043
Sarah?

14
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:49,741
I'm going to say no.

15
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,240
No?

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,500
I think, looking at the graphs we have-- even way, way

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,630
post-1949-- the amount of arable land is continuously decreasing.

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,889
So I would assume that it was a large amount before,

19
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:03,930
but because it was only held in small families it

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,296
wasn't distributed well enough.

21
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:06,290
OK.

22
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,900
It actually was pretty widely distributed,

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,660
because people, then, can move.

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,980
People can move into Sichuan, particularly large migrations

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,190
in the 18th century, into some wonderful land.

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,050
They can move into Manchuria, despite a prohibition against it

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,280
by the Manchus, where there's wonderful farming land.

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,470
And Shandong.

29
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,260
If you look at people, their lineage, of people

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,870
who now call themselves dongbei ren, so many of them came from very poor places

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,250
in Shandong, leaving their ancestral homelands for better farming.

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,680
So there is an expansion to this, but there are also limits.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,760
The one thing I would say is that it shows

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,830
what can happen when a lot of people work small pieces of land.

35
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:49,060
It is per-acre probably the most productive farming system in the world.

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,280
You can think of it as intensive garden farming,

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,260
but it's incredibly productive.

38
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,260
It's not backward, by any measure, compared to other parts of the world.

39
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,585
And for the resources put into it, it's extraordinarily productive.

40
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:08,380


41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:15,290
And, of course, it doesn't just grow food.

42
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,360
What else is grown?

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,011
