Biodiversity-- Confronted with images of city smog and haze,

2
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,020
very few people think of China as a place

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,870
of natural beauty and biodiversity.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,340
But in fact, China is one of the most biologically diverse nations

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,590
in the world, with over 17,000 species of plants and animals, many of which

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,530
are unique to China, such as the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,810
or the Tibetan antelope.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,640
Yet at the same time, it is estimated that 35% of vertebrates

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,420
and maybe 70% of non-flowering plants are endangered in China.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,880
Loss of biodiversity in China is largely the result of industrialization

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
and urbanization, as well as logging, mining, and hunting.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,220
Climate change has also had an effect.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,810
Even a small change in temperature can have

14
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,870
extreme effects on natural habitats.

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,660
Changing temperatures and rainfall distribution across China

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,910
are already affecting habitats and food supply of animals,

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,570
such as the giant panda, the golden monkey, the crested ibis

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,590
and other species found only in China.

19
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:25,120
