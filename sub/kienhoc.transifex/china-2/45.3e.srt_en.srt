00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:06,950


3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,600
Well, thinking-- this leads really to a final topic

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,530
that I want to talk with you about and I think a very important one

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,020
looking at the future in the light of the past.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:26,180
If someone from a far distance were to look at China in 1977 or 1978,

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,200
it could look over now nearly three decades of communist rule

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,280
in which almost everything that could go wrong

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,380
went wrong-- many areas of progress of the very early 1950s,

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,800
but followed by the Anti-Rightist Campaign, by the Great Leap Forward,

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,690
by the Cultural Revolution.

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,090
The rest of East Asia had gone forward dramatically

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,570
over these nearly 30 years, and China had, from 1958 to 1970,

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,530
essentially stagnated and gone, in comparative terms,

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,680
dramatically backward.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,780
All of the promise of being the great power

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,700
and the leading power of East Asia that seemed

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,120
so obvious to many people around the world, even in 1945

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,420
before the revolution, seemed gone.

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,710
No one, and I think it's absolutely fair to say, no one in China

21
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,270
or anywhere else could imagine China today

22
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,030
in 1978-- the second largest economy in the world, a global power

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,520
politically as well as militarily, a power whose word needs

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,860
to be consulted on every matter, as it should be,

25
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,010
on every matter of international importance.

26
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,680
And if one were to have been told that China

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,610
will become this extraordinary economic and global power,

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,460
as it seemed poised to do earlier, and the Chinese Communist Party would still

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,140
be in power, most people in the late 1970s would never have believed this.

30
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,460
How do you account, if you can, for what you and others have called

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,380
this kind of resilient authoritarianism in China,

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,169
and how did the Chinese Communist Party make the most of this, one way

33
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:14,120
I think of it is, this extraordinary second chance.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,370
Yeah, it's a fascinating question.

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,490
It really is the question of our day, I think, as we look at China.

36
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,800
Certainly my first experience in China-- I was born there,

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,200
but I have no memory of that initial experience.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,770
So I first went back in 1979 and lived there for a year in 1979 to 1980

39
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,690
and was quite honestly very shocked when I first

40
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,630
lived in China at how poor it was.

41
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,970
I never could have imagined anything of the sort that has happened.

42
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,270
I grew up in Japan, which also, of course,

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,030
underwent a renaissance in the 1950s and early 1960s.

44
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,330
I spent a lot of time in Taiwan in the 1960s and '70s,

45
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,820
which also experienced an extraordinary developmental trajectory

46
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,640
in that period.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,350
But what has happened in the PRC dwarfs these other very impressive

48
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,120
experiences.

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,710
So it really is extraordinary, and I would agree.

50
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,870
Although the economist Barry Naughton will say that economists certainly

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,970
predicted a major development in China in the 1980s and '90s once

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,090
it was willing to undertake market reform and to de-collectivize.

53
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,400
But nobody predicted, certainly, that that kind of development

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,780
would occur under the auspices of a basically

55
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,360
unreformed Communist party-state system.

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,830
So it is a huge surprise.

57
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,510
And I and my colleague at Trier University in Germany, Sebastian

58
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,770
Heilmann, have attempted to provide an explanation for this puzzle in a book

59
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,940
that we co-edited and re-entitled it Mao's Invisible Hand,

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,730
suggesting that the secret of the amazing reform effort in China

61
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,580
must be attributed not only to Adam Smith's

62
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,240
invisible hand of the market, which is obviously extremely important,

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,220
simply the freeing up of a command economy

64
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,080
and allowing Chinese economic forces to work their dynamic magic,

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,870
but also that there was a hidden hand of Mao Zedong.

66
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,140
On the one hand, you're certainly right that Mao

67
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,670
is responsible for much of the destruction and the under-development

68
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,990
of China, beginning-- it depends how you want to date it-- but certainly

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,800
at least by the Great Leap Forward of 1958,

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,130
'59-- China taking a path that slowed down

71
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,420
its developmental trajectory in many respects.

72
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,030
And yet, despite that fact, we believe that Maoism,

73
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,180
by which we're just speaking in shorthand for some

74
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,740
of the experiences of the Chinese revolution,

75
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,910
of the Communist Party that developed particularly

76
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,720
during the wartime-base areas against Japan,

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,340
that there was a kind of flexibility, a kind of guerrilla policy-making,

78
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,030
if you will, on the part of the Chinese Communist Party

79
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,190
that's really quite different from what you saw in the former Soviet Union

80
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,460
or in other communist parties that had not

81
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,190
experienced a revolutionary tradition.

82
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,350
That there is an interest in experimentation in the part of China.

83
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,380
There is the whole vocabulary of experimental test points, or shidian.

84
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,700
There's the vocabulary of taking something

85
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:49,390
from a point from one test area and then expanding it, cong dian dao mian.

86
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,935
These ideas that you basically, inductively or experimentally, attempt

87
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:57,810
a lot of things on the ground, and some of them work and some of them

88
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,380
don't work.

89
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,770
And those things that work you can embrace as central policy

90
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,780
and then take to another area is in the DNA of the Chinese Communist Party.

91
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,800
We believe that Mao squelched it with his own cult of personality

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,440
at various periods in his own day.

93
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,860
But his tremendous success as a guerrilla leader

94
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,650
and much of what he wrote after 1949 about health care, about education,

95
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,810
and so on represents this kind of experimental approach

96
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,630
that we believe really came to full fruition in the post-Mao period.

97
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:42,950
You're certainly right that when we look at China in '77, '78,

98
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,250
we compare it to the other East Asian countries,

99
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,800
we think, wow, China wasn't doing terribly well in this period under Mao.

100
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
On the other hand, our colleague Amartya Sen, who's made a rather interesting

101
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,820
different comparison with China not to the other East Asian

102
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,670
developmental states, but to India.

103
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,700
And there he argues, I think quite persuasively,

104
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,800
that if you look at India and China at two crucial junctures in history,

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,150
1948, '49, when both of these new states are set up,

106
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:22,930
and then 1978, '79, 30 years later, most people in '48, '49

107
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,450
would have predicted that India would have well outdone

108
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:33,395
China on most indicators, partly because India was and is a democracy,

109
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:35,740
and partly because at that early stage, although they're

110
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,440
kind of similar in a lot of ways.

111
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,950
But India actually had more in the way of industrial investment

112
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,550
and so on than China.

113
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,190
And yet if you look at those two countries at the end of the Cultural

114
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,270
Revolution in this period where, as you say,

115
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,720
all this destruction had been visited on China,

116
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,070
nevertheless literacy rates and life expectancy rates

117
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,630
had both gone way, way up in China, I think the fastest increase

118
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,440
of those in history, or certainly one of the fastest.

119
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,750
And India's had remained basically stagnant.

120
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,660
And his argument is that that difference in human capital between the two

121
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,940
Asian giants really helps explain why it is

122
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,570
that once China took a more enlightened view of development,

123
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,220
it actually had the human capital to be able to accomplish

124
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,050
amazing things in the 1980s and '90s.

125
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,039
In that same period, India also attempted a whole series

126
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,150
of neoliberal market reforms, and yet its record of achievement

127
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,520
has been much more sluggish than that of China.

128
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,710
So it is a very complicated history, I would say,

129
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,840
even the history of the Mao period.

130
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,390
On the one hand, we see the worst famine in all of human history,

131
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,180
absolutely horrendous.

132
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,410
On the other hand, this surprising improvement in literacy and life

133
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,450
expectancy.

134
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,730
And also, all through the Cultural Revolution, a steady growth

135
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,890
in industrial output.

136
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,190
Not as good as it could have been under different circumstances,

137
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,020
as we quickly discovered.

138
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,580
But while agriculture was stagnating, industry,

139
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,500
still under a very Soviet model of heavy investment in heavy industry,

140
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,560
nevertheless continued to make progress.

141
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,320
And without that kind of foundation, I think

142
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,920
it is very hard to imagine that we would have

143
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,920
gotten this big burst in the post-Mao period.

144
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,310
So from my point of view, the Maoist legacy

145
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,220
is an extremely complicated one in which, on the one hand,

146
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,700
we have these various revolutionary strategies, quite ruthless,

147
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,760
but at the same time have a certain pragmatic, efficient side to them that

148
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,120
has been very beneficial to the Communist Party over its history.

149
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,980
And on the other hand, the Mao era itself sees some of the most inspiring

150
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,210
and some of the most horrific examples of human development

151
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,530
and under-development that we've seen certainly in the 20th century

152
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,760
and, in fact, in much of history.

153
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,870
It actually is a wonderful metaphor and one

154
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,210
that we should all think about-- Mao's invisible hand

155
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,830
to be seen in the political system, but also

156
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,210
in many ways in the economic system and at least giving

157
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,290
the foundations of the human capital that

158
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,370
could be educated to go on to higher education and the great expansion

159
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,600
that we see today, the high literacy rates, the longevity

160
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,670
of the Chinese people, those who live in any event.

161
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,190
So it's a remarkable metaphor, yet another of Professor Perry's books

162
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,310
that has had a big impact on our study of modern China.

163
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,930
Elizabeth Perry, director of the Harvard-Yenching Institute and Henry

164
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,565
Rosovsky Professor of Government, feichang ganxie.

165
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:54,380
Thank you, Bill.

166
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:54,880
Thank you.

167
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,380
Thank you.

168
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,730
Thanks a lot.

169
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,270
