00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,220
4,000 years ago, humans living in the area we now call China

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,580
cohabited with wild elephants which roamed in large herds across the land

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,210
where Beijing stands today.

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,910
By the Tang dynasty, China's elephants, driven

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,790
toward more hospitable conditions by human predation and climate shifts,

6
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,460
had retreated south to the area of Shanghai and Nanjing.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,080
There, flocks of green parrots were recorded populace enough

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,706
to darken the sky as they descend.

9
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:44,580
As late as the sixteenth century the hill country of Jiangxi Province

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,160
still had virgin forest.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,750
It had deer grazing and tigers that roamed the landscape.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,090
Well the elephants, the parrots, the Jiangxi tigers, they're all gone,

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,080
now joined by the Yangzi River's famous and most recently extinct

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,830
White Dolphin.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,379


16
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,760
Pressure on China's natural environment began as early

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,580
as the first millennium BCE with the transformation

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,600
toward settled farming and an economy based on agriculture.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,190
Forests were cleared for the farmland and grasslands

20
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,100
were converted into agricultural fields.

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,820
Massive irrigation projects, infrastructure even then,

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,730
were undertaken.

23
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,620
Consider the case of the Yellow River, the second longest river in China,

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,710
the sixth longest in the world.

25
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,920
The river called Huang or Yellow is because of the massive amounts

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,920
of suspended loess soil in its water.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,670
But it was once known simply as "The River."

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,480
And perhaps it wasn't until the Han dynasty

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,950
that the river began to acquire its now defining color

30
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,260
as a result of the conversion of grasslands to farm,

31
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,430
the felling of huge timber reserves for the purpose of building capital cities,

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,980
and the resulting erosion of the soil.

33
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,670
The single greatest strain on China's environment

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,290
historically comes simply from the sheer number of people living on the land.

35
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,000
In premodern times the striking difference

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,750
between China's population than that of Europe

37
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,580
was that in China the population was not so much concentrated

38
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,390
in the great cities, but living in growing clusters throughout the land.

39
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,850
As we have seen, for every one person living in China in 1400

40
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,210
there were five or six in 1840.

41
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,040
During the so-called long 18th century alone an unusually stable and peaceful

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,600
period under the rule of the great Qing emperors Kangxi, Yongzheng,

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,670
and Qianlong, the empire's population increased from 100 million

44
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,400
to an estimated 320 million.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,360
This enormous growth of population, which would be doubled by 1950

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,250
and then doubled again by the year 2000, has

47
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,160
transformed China more than any other factor.

48
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,670
And today, with a population heading toward 1.4 billion

49
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,540
it remains China's greatest challenge.

50
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,600
The environmental costs of so many people on a limited amount of land

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,460
were immense and they continue today.

52
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,440
The ecological nightmare of the contemporary landscape

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,070
in Northern and North Central China is the direct result of such long-standing

54
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,820
and enduring population pressure for which

55
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,170
it is difficult to imagine any easy remedy.

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,835
