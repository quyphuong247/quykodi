1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,790
Well, let's think of Beijing in 2035.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,700
Beijing is of course not China though it's is often a metaphor for China.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,140
This northernmost outpost on the North China Plain

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,630
became a capital city you will remember under the Mongols.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,450
And for much of the past 700 years, it has been a center

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,530
of political and cultural power.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,470
By 2035, however, it is an open question as to whether Beijing

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,270
will remain the capital.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,220
Will it be physically sustainable or will it

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,650
be a casualty of China's economic growth and environmental degradation?

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,120
Will its ministries continue the infrastructure state

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,230
of the 20th century well into the 21st?

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,600
Will its universities lead China to international leadership in education?

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,020
Will Beijing be a center of global influence?

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,460
And will the current regime or some semblance of it still be in power?

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,300
And if not, what does that mean for the rest of us?

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,650
If we think of the environment, Beijing is a metaphor for China

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,430
when it comes to environmental issues.

19
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,930
As we've seen, it's notoriously bad air caused by local and regional pollutants

20
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,060
as well as Inner Asian dust storms improved only temporarily

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,890
during the 2008 Olympics or the recent APEC Summit.

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,540
Water for this municipality of more than 20 million

23
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,240
is increasingly in short supply.

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,570
Its once famous springs have disappeared and reservoirs

25
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,780
have run dry as have many of the 200 streams still listed on Beijing maps.

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,220
2/3 of its water still comes from the ground water, which

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,710
is being consumed much faster than it could be refreshed,

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,690
and it too is being polluted.

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,090
Two years ago, in early 2013 Beijing's air

30
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,960
exceeded the 2010 scary bad levels according to the unofficial estimates

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,910
of the US embassy in Beijing far off the already scary scales

32
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:16,150
of reference for atmospheric pollution, the so-called "airpocalypse" of 2013.

33
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,530
Nevertheless this is an area in which I feel progress is likely

34
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,720
and this is because no one is hurt more by environmental degradation in China

35
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,260
than the Chinese people themselves.

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,590
Even the government quarters of Zhongnanhai

37
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,650
are shrouded in noxious haze.

38
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,940
Although, they have good filters indoors.

39
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,130
Environmental remediation is becoming a matter of national priority

40
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,190
and both economic growth and public health

41
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,470
depend on continued improvement in this area.

42
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,230
In recent years, we've seen remarkable investments

43
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,680
being made in every environmental asset class from nuclear power stations

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,690
to wind farms, solar panels and hydroelectric facilities.

45
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,370
Unlike in the United States, there's virtually no debate in China

46
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,560
about either the scope of the environmental challenge

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,920
or the underlying science.

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,880
Global warming is not an area of controversy in China.

49
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,237
Chinese experience it and they believe it.

50
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:19,070
This is a case where the Chinese engineering

51
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,540
state and limits on civil debate may actually be an asset.

52
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,210
We might think of it as environmental action with Chinese characteristics.

53
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,940
It is also an area of opportunity for Chinese business.

54
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,620
I expect that over the next two decades Chinese firms will emerge

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,570
as global leaders in clean energy.

56
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,010
Thus our old friends at the Wanxiang Group

57
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,450
having mastered the universal joint, dominated the Chinese

58
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,480
and now global auto parts industry.

59
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,770
Having acquired multiple American firms, are

60
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,010
poised to be leaders first in batteries for electric vehicles

61
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,780
and then as a manufacturer of green cars.

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,990
And as we've said before and this is in other areas

63
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,720
the Taiwan experience gives us hope for China as a whole.

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,610
In it's political economy, the People's Republic today

65
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,380
mirrors the Taiwan of the 1970s.

66
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,779
Authoritarian politics coexisting with a large degree of market economy.

67
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,120
Taiwan in the 1970s also had bad air, bad water, extraordinary levels

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
of pollution even in rural rivers.

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Today, after three decades of environmental protests followed

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,930
by remediating policies, Taiwan is a place

71
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,680
that can once again display it's great natural beauty

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,500
with clearer skies, cleaner rivers, beautiful streams

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,670
and a broad public commitment to environmental sanity.

74
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:54,571
