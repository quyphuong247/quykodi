1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,970
Land.

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,360
China, as we know, is the world's most populous country,

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,600
home to 22% of the world's population.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,990
But it is only the world's third-largest country in terms of area.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,020
And much of its land as we know is not suited for agriculture.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,800
In order to feed more than one-fifth of the world's population

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,190
using less than a tenth of the world's arable land, China of course

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,560
trades for food in international markets.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,010
But the Chinese government has also set a red line

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:49,200
to ensure that arable land would not fall below about 120 million hectares.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,560
However, a significant land loss in recent years

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,150
has left China already very, very close to its official

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,550
allegedly minimal needs as cities have grown

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,120
and as farmers have lost land to development.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,000
In 2007, the Chinese government reported that more than 10% of China's farmland

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,830
had also been rendered useless by pollution.

17
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:20,040
By 2014, 60% of China's sown area was exposed

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,450
to 85% of the nation's heavy metal discharge,

19
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,500
contaminating farmlands, threatening food security,

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,670
and affecting the health of farmers.

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,590
And China's scarce arable land has become scarcer still

22
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,640
as a result of desertification.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,090
Years of human overcultivation, deforestation, overgrazing, and overuse

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,800
of groundwater resources have led to serious wind erosion and the spreading

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,220
of desert sands in north and in central China.

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,930
The Gobi Desert is expanding across north, central,

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,320
and northwestern regions of the People's Republic

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,360
by about 3,600 square kilometers every year.

29
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,760
China's rate of desertification has accelerated very quickly

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,490
since the late 1950s and particularly since the late 1980s.

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,710
It encroaches on cities and towns.

32
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,520
It destroys cropland and helps to create even greater dust

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,930
storms in Beijing and across the northern part of the country.

34
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,464
