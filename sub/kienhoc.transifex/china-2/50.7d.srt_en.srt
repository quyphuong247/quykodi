00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:08,750


3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,250
BILL KIRBY: Let's take a first short-term and then long-term

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,380
perspective.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,760
China's still, at least for the next 15, 20 years, heavily dependent on coal.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,987
What can they do more to make this cleaner?

7
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,820
I mean, there are different standards, which

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,810
I gather are unevenly enforced across the country.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,600
These are very local producers, by and large.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,530
We're not talking about a national grid that

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,800
is controlled centrally in Beijing, but thousands and thousands

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,702
of local coal-fired plants.

13
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:45,380
Do you see progress there in terms of just environmental conscience?

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,890
Cleaning them up in a way so that as mercury comes out or--

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,360
MICHAEL MCELROY: I think that they're doing some smart things.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,210
So, for example, the efficiency of a coal-fired power plant can be as low

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,269
as 18%, 15%-- that's the amount of the coal energy that's produced

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,980
that's turned into electricity-- or as high as 30% or 40%.

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,440
So what they've been doing is closing down the really inefficient, dirty

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,760
coal-fired power plants and, at the same time,

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,820
building more big ones that are really actually more efficient.

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,730
So that's at least a step in the right direction.

23
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:30,570
But you also have to move aggressively to this new energy system in which coal

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,560
is going to be phased out.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,630
It has to be phased out.

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,051
Otherwise, the climate issue will get worse.

27
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:40,800
What's happening in the US, I think, is interesting at the moment.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,260
We're actually phasing out coal.

29
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,920
And we're phasing out coal in part because of steps taken by the EPA

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,760
without support from the Congress.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,420
And we're also doing it because the economics actually favors

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,145
closing down coal-fired power plants because natural gas is cheap.

33
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:03,020
BILL KIRBY: You're clearly not running for election in West Virginia.

34
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,936
MICHAEL MCELROY: No, I'm not running for that.

35
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:08,389
So if, in fact, we want to deal with the issue--

36
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,856
so we are actually reducing CO2 emissions of the US

37
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:11,860
in a significant way.

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,220
We're actually almost back to where we were in 1990s, which is pretty amazing.

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,040
And if we're going to actually continue to make progress in the US,

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,140
we have to build up the renewable side of this thing.

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,700
Coal has to disappear, has to be replaced by wind and solar.

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,667
Now, replacing natural gas with wind depends on the price of natural gas.

43
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,750
I would actually be in favor of natural gas prices

44
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,210
being a little higher than they are in the US.

45
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,720
That way wind could compete without having subsidies on either side.

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,500
How could we actually deal with this issue?

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,610
One way-- I would be in favor of the US becoming a net exporter of natural gas

48
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,940
to China.

49
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,440
So that would be good for both countries, in my opinion.

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,860
It would help the Chinese clean up their air quality.

51
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,940
It would be better than using dirty coal.

52
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,805
And it would make natural gas prices slightly higher

53
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:06,710
in the US, which would make renewables competitive.

54
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,389
We need global issues, global analysis to deal with the issue.

55
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,180
BILL KIRBY: Now the Russians have just signed a very large gas deal

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,870
with China.

57
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,270
Do you see this having a significant impact on China's energy consumption?

58
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,520
MICHAEL MCELROY: Yes, it will.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,040
I think that getting natural gas from the Russians,

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,200
particularly if they made a good deal on the price, is obviously a step forward.

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,840
But I don't think the Chinese see it as the end of their energy problem.

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,550
I think that they see that they are going

63
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,102
to have to rely on LNG imports-- liquefied natural gas imports.

64
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:42,060
And they're building the ports to receive that.

65
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,760
And I would be in favor of the US becoming a net supplier.

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,045
CHRIS NIELSEN: China is importing natural gas from a lot of places.

67
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:53,790
It's importing it by pipeline from Central Asia.

68
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,320
It's also importing it from Myanmar.

69
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:03,370
And I think this deal with Russia is substantially motivated--

70
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,820
at least partly motivated-- by the environmental benefits of burning

71
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,470
gas instead of coal, for the reasons that Mike's described.

72
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,140
There is one thing that I think you have to be concerned about in terms

73
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,590
of a huge transition, or a substantial transition,

74
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,560
towards natural gas use in China, including potentially fracking.

75
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,320
So there's a big question about how much shale gas China has.

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,070
There's some gigantic numbers out there.

77
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,800
There's been some difficulty getting some wells started.

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,940
And there's various aspects of geology-- they say both above ground

79
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,190
and below ground constraints.

80
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,940
But there is some possibility that China--

81
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,481
BILL KIRBY: And there's water issues.

82
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,949
CHRIS NIELSEN: And water issues in certain areas.

83
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,740
There is some possibility that China could have a lot of shale gas.

84
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,730
And I would expect that the government is

85
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,400
going to pull out the stops to find out, to try and solve

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,626
the problems as much as it can.

87
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:00,500
But there is an important issue that you have

88
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,400
to think about when it comes to the climate implications of this.

89
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,210
One has to do with the carbon benefit of burning gas instead of coal.

90
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,180
It has roughly half the carbon per unit energy delivered.

91
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,680
So it's better in terms of CO2 emissions.

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,935
But natural gas is substantially methane.

93
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:21,830
And methane is also a very, very powerful greenhouse gas,

94
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,372
in fact a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

95
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:26,580
So there's a question-- this is a question in the US,

96
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,780
too, in terms of shifting towards more and more reliance on natural gas--

97
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,050
is how much leakage is there from the system,

98
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,855
from the exploitation stage through the pipelines

99
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:41,830
through the end use of methane into the atmosphere.

100
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,390
And there's a certain amount of leakage, which is imaginable in places.

101
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,270
People are debating what this level is in the United States.

102
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,420
Whether or not there's actually a climate benefit of shifting to gas

103
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,882
or not-- you have to have a tight system.

104
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:58,840
You have to make sure that there's not too much methane being released.

105
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,780
And that's a question in terms of how China develops, for instance,

106
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,000
it's domestic gas reserves.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,810
Is it going to be able to do it in a way that this potentially fugitive methane

108
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,530
is captured?

109
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,844
Otherwise it can help clean up the air in some respect,

110
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,010
or contribute to cleaning up the air-- although Mike

111
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,300
would say it's not enough.

112
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,670
But it could have a downside for climate.

113
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,455
So that's a big question.

114
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:30,840
And I think China will be scrutinized over that if it does end up

115
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,678
trying to exploit its natural gas--

116
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:33,594
MICHAEL MCELROY: Yeah.

117
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:39,656
I think that the so-called shale revolution has really revolutionized

118
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:42,570
energy issues in the United States.

119
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,830
And it's likely to have an impact in other places.

120
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,840
The jury's out on whether China has significant natural gas from Shale.

121
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,340
But where the jury is not out is that China is not

122
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,180
going to significantly develop that resource in less than 10, 15, 20 years.

123
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,720
I mean, the infrastructure required to do is enormous.

124
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,360
And you mentioned the problem of water.

125
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,900
The problem of water is a very, very serious issue for China

126
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,680
because it's not just water for hydroelectric generation.

127
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,960
You need water to run coal-fired power plants.

128
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,460
And you need water for agriculture.

129
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,550
And China is water scarce and likely to become

130
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,347
even more water scarce in the future.

131
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,180
BILL KIRBY: Not in this part of China, but--

132
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,700
MICHAEL MCELROY: Not in this part.

133
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,990
But in the northern part and--

134
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,140
BILL KIRBY: East and shortly to our north.

135
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,130
MICHAEL MCELROY: And even if you look at the generation of electricity

136
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,800
from hydro in the Three Gorges and of the upper regions of the Yangtze,

137
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,580
it's got a very significant seasonal variation.

138
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,320
It's low in winter, and it's high in summer.

139
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:53,280
And, as I mentioned, in 2011, the summer peak was 50% lower than it was before.

140
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,720
BILL KIRBY: So let me ask you, if you look to the future here,

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,910
we have historical examples of horrifically polluted cities

142
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,290
and countries that now seem clean.

143
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:13,620
London has lousy weather, but it doesn't have the deathly smog of the 1950s.

144
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,430
Los Angeles-- the Dodgers can again play under comparatively blue skies, which,

145
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,710
for a number of decades, they couldn't.

146
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,440
And that kind of orange mist or cloud that you would always

147
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,807
see, every time, flying into LAX.

148
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,390
I'm thinking of a place where-- when I was a graduate student,

149
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,100
I lived in Taiwan.

150
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,830
And Taiwan was rapidly developing then, like China is today.

151
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,630
Very heavy particulate matter.

152
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,380
I had a little balcony, which I would sweep up

153
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,789
the pollution dust every morning.

154
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,550
And I'd get a lot of it outdoors.

155
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,010
You could never see the mountains, the beautiful mountains, around Taipei

156
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,990
except when a typhoon came through.

157
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,440
And that's not a really helpful way of doing that.

158
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,270
Today, Taiwan seems comparatively pristine.

159
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,800
Enormous progress has been made.

160
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
I remember rural rivers being totally dirty and polluted.

161
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,812
And this is the late '70s, early '80s.

162
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:13,700
Now they are absolutely pristine.

163
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,840
And Taiwan has a green movement, not just

164
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,230
politically-- although it's had an impact, because it

165
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,020
has an opposition party that has pushed this agenda very hard.

166
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,890
But nevertheless, the government has also embraced it,

167
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,190
and Taiwan compared to any part of mainland China

168
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,440
does seem to have made enormous progress.

169
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,260
So my sense is, A, there are certain similarities in regimes here--

170
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,930
both the importance of engineering and talent in the leadership.

171
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,770
And out of scientific talent in Taiwan's leadership, today also in China's

172
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,075
leadership, can this here on the mainland, this government of engineers,

173
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:52,350
turn this around?

174
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,960
My own hope is that if any country has the capacity

175
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,770
to turn around problems of the scope of China's, it actually

176
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,400
is China's government.

177
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,430
MICHAEL MCELROY: Yeah, well, if you think about-- so how did London

178
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,760
solve London's problem?

179
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,620
What it did was to say, OK.

180
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,390
Initially it said, you may not burn dirty coal-- dirty coal

181
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,920
meaning coal that produces soot.

182
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,050
So you have to burn what they call smokeless fuel.

183
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,250
So that's higher-grade coal that doesn't have a lot of particulate matter.

184
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,591
And people kept doing it.

185
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:31,090
And then after a while, they found they had another problem.

186
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,070
The problem was acidification of the streams.

187
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,890
And that was clearly coming from that clean coal that was--

188
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,950
and so then the decision was that you had

189
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,530
to stop people burning coal, period, in their houses.

190
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,650
You had to have central heating.

191
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,850
And so they made that transition.

192
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,360
And now the air is, as you said, relatively clean.

193
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,214
We did the same kind of thing in US cities.

194
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:56,630
Pittsburgh, for example-- when I first went to Pittsburgh,

195
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,180
Pittsburgh was as dirty as Belfast was, where I grew up.

196
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,210
Pittsburgh is now clean.

197
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,240
I mean, the buildings were black when I went there in the '60s.

198
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,375
BILL KIRBY: And that's not because the steel industry has moved to Asia?

199
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,625
MICHAEL MCELROY: No, it isn't.

200
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:12,380
It's because, in fact, what they've done is to cut down

201
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,090
on the particulate emissions.

202
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,770
The Clean Air Act in 1970, Nixon's major achievement,

203
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:27,440
made a big difference to the obvious implications of air pollution.

204
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,580
I think that it's relatively easy to deal with a localized

205
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,560
problem by investing significant resources, by changing your fuel mix,

206
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,220
by investing in reducing the conventional emissions from fuel mix.

207
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,850
But if you have to do that for 1.3 billion people

208
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,245
who are consuming already more coal than any other part of the world,

209
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,190
that's a hell of a lot harder problem.

210
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,310
BILL KIRBY: So you're not so optimistic.

211
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,340
MICHAEL MCELROY: Well, I believe it would

212
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,720
be a mistake to understate exactly how big that problem is.

213
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:11,600
To make that transition to a clean Taiwan-type future of Asia

214
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,845
is going to require an enormous transition from-- my sense

215
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:21,110
is of what China has done is to look at what happened in the West.

216
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,470
How did the West become rich?

217
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:29,712
It became rich by burning a lot of coal, by developing an automobile industry,

218
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:30,920
by doing all of those things.

219
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,086
So China said, OK, we're going to do the same thing.

220
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,260
And we're going to do it faster.

221
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,090
The problem is that it leads to a series of problems

222
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,620
that require another change in the way in which you're

223
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,705
going to run the future.

224
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:47,560
And that's a hell of a challenge to make that change in a very short period.

225
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,080
How long did it take the US to clean up air quality, for example?

226
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,360
We didn't do it 10 years.

227
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,780
The EPA in 1970 made some clean air standards.

228
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,480
But we didn't really get there for 25 years or so.

229
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,980
And we're still actually struggling with it, some would say.

230
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,323
So now we're asking China to do this in 10 years?

231
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:06,656
I mean, this is a tough problem.

232
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:07,865
It should not be understated.

233
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:08,614
BILL KIRBY: Right.

234
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:09,810
So forget the 10-year thing.

235
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,980
But one has the sense that these global issues are not addressable

236
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,784
unless the United States and China both lead in this effort, the United

237
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,700
States being historically the great pollutant,

238
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,100
China now having taken over that unenviable spot.

239
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,430
MICHAEL MCELROY: I'm strongly in favor of-- I

240
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,600
think that the way in which we've addressed the climate

241
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,020
issue with every country in the world having an equal voice, essentially,

242
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,620
is ineffective.

243
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,310
I think we have to focus on the fact that it would be better

244
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,270
to have a strongly coordinated bilateral approach between the US and China

245
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,670
to deal with these issues together.

246
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,080
And I think that if we were able to do that,

247
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
we would be addressing two types of problems.

248
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,455
In the case of the US, we're addressing the problems that

249
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:07,340
are posed by a mature energy economy.

250
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,090
And in the case of China, we're addressing

251
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,090
the problems that are posed by a developing energy economy.

252
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,420
Different challenges, different opportunities.

253
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,290
If we actually did this in a serious way,

254
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,660
I think that that's the way in which we could actually

255
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,340
bring that message to the rest of the world in a serious way.

256
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,075
And the other thing I want to say is that it's really important

257
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:30,090
to focus on the fact that the London problem, the Donora, Pennsylvania

258
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,870
problem, the Taiwan problem were local problems.

259
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,630
Energy issues today are global issues.

260
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,310
We're talking in here in the middle of June.

261
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,020
What are we reading about in newspapers?

262
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,240
We're reading today about the fact that the Russians are potentially

263
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,270
going to turn off gas to Ukraine.

264
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,390
We're reading about the fact that Europe may

265
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,700
be on the downside of not getting gas from Russia that it depends on.

266
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,370
The issues are global.

267
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,850
What happens in one place affects what happens everywhere else.

268
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,770
The other story in the Chinese newspaper that I read this morning

269
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:10,510
was that the price of oil has now spiked up to $109, $110 dollars a barrel,

270
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,560
largely because of the serious problems that are happening in Iraq.

271
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,080
But the fact that there is a problem in Iraq

272
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,630
has implications for the consumer in China.

273
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,190
The oil price in China will go up in response to what's happening in Iraq.

274
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,900
So it's an interconnected world.

275
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,139
