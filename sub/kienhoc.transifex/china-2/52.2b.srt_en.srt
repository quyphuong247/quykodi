1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,600
Well, with the Communists' victory over the Nationalists on the mainland

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,040
in 1949, the story changed further.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,410
Nearly two million Chinese mainlanders fled to the island of Taiwan.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,600
The Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-Shek, formally-- and in theory,

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,840
temporarily-- established the wartime capital of the Republic of China

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,260
in Taiwan's main city of Taipei.

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,320
Taiwan was to be the base from which the mainland would be recovered.

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,900
Taiwan came directly under the one party authoritarian rule

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,270
of the Kuomindang, which sought to crush Taiwanese dissent and any movement

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,100
toward Taiwan independence.

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,570
It ruled the island by martial law.

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,160
Paradoxically, despite the assertions of both the Communists

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,460
and the Nationalists that Taiwan was part of China-- each

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,260
claiming to be China's legitimate government-- the de

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,269
facto political separation of the island from the mainland

16
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,240
meant that after 1950, Taiwan emerged for the first time

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,940
as an autonomous political entity.

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,610
The ROC on Taiwan held its own elections-- initially tightly

19
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,530
controlled and often bought, but by the 1990s,

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,510
democratic-- and entered into international treaties,

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,660
notably an alliance with the United States which lasted from 1954 to 1979.

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,540
And it maintained its own army, navy, and air force,

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,540
not to mention a vibrant independent economy.

24
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,510
The ROC on Taiwan held the China seat in the United Nations General Assembly

25
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,970
and in the Security Council until 1971.

26
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,220
From that date, however, the number of nations recognizing

27
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,040
the Republic of China on Taiwan as a sovereign state decreased steadily,

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,250
and Taiwan would gradually abandon its claim to the mainland.

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,420
Autonomous-- but not, in the eyes of much of the world,

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,150
independent-- Taiwan began to assert its sovereignty in different terms.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:14,430
According to Tung Chen-yuan, former Vice Chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,170
Council, "the crux of cross-Strait issues

33
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,670
lies in the People's Republic of China's persistent refusal

34
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,070
to recognize the fact that the Republic of China

35
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,110
has continued to exist since 1949.

36
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,190
And that Taiwan's sovereignty is independent from the rule of China.

37
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,250
And that Taiwan and China have no jurisdiction over each other."

38
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,610
Beijing, by contrast, has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan.

39
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,600
It has never sought to take Taiwan by force,

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,930
but it has never renounced the possibility of military resolution.

41
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,560
For the last two decades it has proposed for Taiwan

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,287
a re-incorporation into China under the one country, two systems (yiguo

43
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:07,670
liangzhi) policy, which it applied to Hong Kong in 1997 and Macau in 1999.

44
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,200
For its part, the United States-- which at the outset of the Korean war in 1950

45
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,040
had sent its fleet into the Taiwan Strait

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,270
to keep the island from falling into communist hands,

47
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,510
and which had supported Taiwan with military and economic aid--

48
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,140
began to normalize its relations with the People's Republic in the 1970s.

49
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,170
It recognized the People's Republic as the legitimate government of China

50
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:41,240
in 1979, even as it asserted its right to continue informal relations with

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,550
and sell defensive arms to Taiwan.

52
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,090
The Americans agreed to a so-called one China principle

53
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,860
based on the assumption-- which was true enough in the 1970s--

54
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,270
that the governments on either side of the Taiwan Strait

55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:03,050
believed that there was but one China, and that Taiwan was part of it.

56
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,900
Beijing's claims to sovereignty notwithstanding,

57
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,840
the People's Republic has never governed Taiwan for an instant.

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,320
And indeed from 1949 until the late 1980s,

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Taiwan was more cut off from the Chinese mainland

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,279
than ever it had been under Japanese rule.

61
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,290


62
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,540
Under these circumstances, the Nationalist government

63
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,000
was free to lay a political and economic development path of its own

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,310
that was quite different from that of its cross-strait rival, the PRC.

65
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:45,526
