00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:07,770


3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,620
Welcome.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,070
Welcome.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,860
Welcome to our friends across the world in ChinaX.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,570
We have here a subset of our class-- the true vanguard

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,820
of the proletariat-- who are here an hour early before class

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,490
so that we can film this case for our broader audience

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,110
and also talk about an incredibly important issue-- that

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,320
is to say agriculture in China.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,580
And so we're going to start, in a general way, by thinking--

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,020
in a broad way about what are the defining--

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,980


14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,430
--aspects of the Chinese agricultural scene,

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,380
if you can describe them before 1949?

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,110
There's a little bit in our case about this.

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:01:01,240
If you were to describe what Chinese farmers' lives were like before 1949,

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,469
how would we--

19
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,209


20
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:11,606
--deal with this if we look first at Chinese agriculture--

21
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:12,490


22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,050
--pre-49?

00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,656
