1
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,341
So Peter, this is not your garden.

2
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:11,840
No.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,530
Professor Bol has a fantastic garden, but this is not his vegetable garden.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,000
It's one of the enormous scale of vegetable gardens

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,630
here at the CP farm near Hangzhou Bay.

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,360
And this area here is for watermelons.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,570
And what we can see right here, a little watermelon.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,479
Right there.

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,840
Right there.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,730
Planted in March.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,630
This is now May.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,800
April, May.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,370
35 days from now, that watermelon is going

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,890
to be a round watermelon about that big, weighing 10 pounds.

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,790
10 pounds.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,450
35 days.

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,580
That is awfully fast.

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,440
That is awfully fast.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,670
Right now, they're beginning to take off the plastic covering that

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,890
gave them this early start.

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,480
And the water, as these spread--

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,210
So what you've done is, you've put in these ditches, actually,

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,110
not so much for irrigation as to-- well, it's for irrigation,

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,140
but also to take the salt out of the soil.

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,265
And so as the water runs down through here, it's picking up the salt,

26
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:19,916
it's irrigating the plants.

27
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:20,790
The salt's going out.

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,920
And every 10 meters or so, there's a really big ditch to pick up the water.

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,190
So there can be multiple crops of watermelons.

30
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,310
This is why watermelon is on every table of every Chinese banquet

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,330
that you can have in China, because you can grow it now

32
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,550
so fast, if you have this industrialized means.

33
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,370
And then, in the fall, when it's too late for watermelon--

34
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,040
In September, they plant broccoli.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,080
And beginning in November, they start to harvest.

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,490
And so only in December, January, February,

37
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,920
really, only three months of the year, is this is not actually producing.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,330
I think, actually, they can continue the broccoli production and harvesting

39
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,380
for another three months, into February.

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,760
So there's one month, really, that February - March,

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,350
where this is not producing.

42
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,645
