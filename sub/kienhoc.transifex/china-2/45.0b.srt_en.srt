1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,260
Welcome to post-Mao China.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,910
When Mao Zedong died in Beijing in September of 1976,

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,600
the China that he had presided over was a much different place than the China

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,990
that we know today.

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,810
It was closer, in fact, to today's North Korea, perhaps.

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:31,900
It was a dark, and compared to the rest of East Asia, backward place,

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,800
as East Asia had roared forward in the postwar period

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,530
while China had, particularly from 1958 to the mid-1970s, stagnated,

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,810
a country that had been beset by political terror

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,170
and political instability, by mass famine and insufficiency

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,070
in the economy, and by international isolation,

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,340
at least until the early 1970s, self-isolating as well as

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,240
being isolated first from the West and then from the Eastern Bloc.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,530
It was not in an auspicious position, in short.

15
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,350
What we're trying to address in a series of interviews,

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,810
now, with colleagues here at Harvard is the question,

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:22,130
how did China do so comparatively well in the period from 1978 to the present?

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,970
If the first 30 years of the People's Republic

19
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,160
was one of great limitations and great disasters,

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,530
the nearly 40 years since the death of Mao Zedong

21
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,760
have been nothing short of transformational.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,360
Rather than give you a decade by decade or year by year account,

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,210
I've invited several of my Harvard colleagues

24
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,680
to come and talk about this period from different perspectives,

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,410
and indeed from different scholarly disciplines.

26
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:55,170
We'll be joined by a sociologist, an economist, and a political scientist,

27
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,090
each one of whom have deeply studied and been influential

28
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,350
in the study of post-Mao China.

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,330
Our first guest will be Professor Ezra Vogel from our Department of Sociology,

30
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,080
a professor in the social sciences here at Harvard,

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,370
who has just completed a magisterial biography

32
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,730
on the architect of the post-Mao reforms, Deng Xiaoping.

33
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,630
And he will talk about Deng.

34
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,680
He will talk about his book, which has been translated and widely read

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,250
in the People's Republic today.

36
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,900
And he will talk about the policy choices

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,290
that China faced in the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s,

38
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,940
through and after the great confrontation at Tiananmen of 1989.

39
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,570
Then professor Dwight Perkins from our Economics Department,

40
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,210
and a longtime Director of the Harvard Institute for International

41
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,150
Development, will be joining us to talk about macro

42
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,110
trends in the Chinese economy, policy choices that were made,

43
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,190
and what are the great challenges that the Chinese economy faces domestically

44
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,660
and internationally today.

45
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,820
And Professor Perkins comes to this from a lifetime of study of China's economy

46
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,190
and economic history, but also from the point of view of somebody

47
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,040
who, at least in my experience, has been more consistently right

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,190
about the Chinese economy than anybody else.

49
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,210
And third, we'll be joined by the Director of the Harvard-Yenching

50
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,410
Institute, Professor Elizabeth Perry, a noted political scientist who

51
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,020
also has a historian's flair for looking at the present in the light

52
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,740
of the past, and the past, in part, in the light of the present.

53
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,610
And she will help us to understand what she has called China's resilient

54
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,890
authoritarianism and the still-impressive capacity

55
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,230
of the Chinese state to navigate what to other governments

56
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,340
might be formidable challenges.

57
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,820
I think you're going to learn a lot from my friends and colleagues

58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,330
here at Harvard, and I hope you enjoy these interviews.

59
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:08,235
