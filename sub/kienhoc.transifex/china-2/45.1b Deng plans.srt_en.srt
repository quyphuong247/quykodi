00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,160
Deng suffers enormously during the Cultural Revolution,

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,970
as does his family.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,450
He comes back to power as vice premier, as I recall, in 1973.

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:26,160
Then begins to lead an effort, really getting back to the efforts of 1956,

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,730
now called the Four Modernizations in 1975.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,910
But he's coming, and in some sense, he's inheriting a government.

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,940
And to some degree, he's inheriting a party that are really on the ropes

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,740
after the disasters of the cultural revolution.

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,720
What's he thinking at that point?

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,390
He wants to overcome the polarization between the people who

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,180
criticized at the Cultural Revolution-- some of them, friends, were killed,

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,000
some of the families were destroyed-- between those people

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,070
and the people who attacked them.

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,640
And it was worse than the civil war, because they

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,760
had to go back to the same units all over the country-- people

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,370
who had fought each other, struggled against each other,

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,060
sometimes killed, lamed, sent to years in the countryside without enough food.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,890
Over a million people died in the cultural revolution,

19
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,930
and that was a disaster.

20
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,470
Mao, in 1975, was already giving Deng a little rope to begin to modernize.

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,270
I think perhaps Mao even at the end realized that he'd gone too far

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,190
and they could end up in chaos.

23
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,570
And he wanted to get things back on track.

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,790
So Deng had a chance in 1975.

25
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,610
Already a number of officials who had been criticized during the Cultural

26
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,140
Revolution, who had been in office before, were beginning to come back.

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,710
And Deng could use them to begin to get an economic program.

28
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,740
And of all economic programs, Deng considered science, technology,

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,547
education the most important.

30
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:53,380
There were Four Modernizations, as you know,

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,040
in industry, agriculture, national defense, science, technology,

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,960
education.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,400
He considered science, technology, education the most important.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,160
And he pushed very hard to get the National Academy of Sciences

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,810
back in operation.

36
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,430
The universities had been closed down.

37
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,290
He'd tried very hard to get them started.

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,185
He couldn't get them full started in 1975.

39
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,740
He didn't have the leisure.

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,820
But he was beginning to do that.

41
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,030
And in the end of '75, Mao decided that Deng was not revolutionary enough.

42
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,010
He would not continue the legacy.

43
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,800
And in early '76, he got rid of Deng again.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,460
So what you have then is Deng going back to being criticized out

45
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,350
of office for another year.

46
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,950
It's very interesting to me that a lot of the great leaders of the world,

47
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,230
like de Gaulle, Churchill, Abraham Lincoln had been in high positions,

48
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,100
lost out, then had time in the countryside

49
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,090
to think about what they were doing.

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:56,350
And Deng's period in the countryside, from 1969 to 1973-- 3 and 1/2 years--

51
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,530
gave him lots of opportunity to think.

52
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,340
His daughter wrote that every day he would pace the garden, thinking--

53
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,860
thinking about what he would do if he came back to Beijing.

54
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,510
And so when he came back in '73, he already

55
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,160
had a vision of the direction he wanted to go

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,020
and a lot of ideas about how to carry it out.

57
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,750
But he gets purged again.

58
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,810
Gets saved in part by allies in the People's Liberation Army.

59
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:32,200
And by December of 1978, he's back, nominally not the chief but in fact

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,740
the number one power in China.

61
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,710
What does he do then?

62
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,203
