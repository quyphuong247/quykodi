1
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,605
OK.

2
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:17,170
Now, today, is Chinese agriculture prospering today?

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,800
Or at the beginning of this case?

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,200
This case talks about the reforms of the '80s and '90s.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,660
And what does happen that is not so tragic for farmers after the Maoist

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,100
period, though?

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,190
Jonathan?

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,175
In 1978, there was the Household Responsibility System.

9
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:33,790
Right.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,890
Which reintroduced private incentive into agriculture.

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,190
It caused an increase in productivity, I think, from 1978 to 2007.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,980
The poverty declined from, like, 30.7% down to 1.6%.

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,665
So huge declines, along with great increases in wages.

14
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:52,370
Right.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,575
And that's really--

16
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,080
productivity increased a lot.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,430
A huge part of that is a return-- this Household Responsibility

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,140
System is another way of calling it-- calling family farming.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,360
Which had been the basic structure of Chinese farming forever.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,980
Or at least as far as we know.

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,060
At least back to Tang, or back to Song period.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,160
So families taking care of their own.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,800
What does Chinese agriculture look from that point toward today?

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,830
Zack?

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,332
It's like pseudo-privatized.

26
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,540
So the land still is almost--

27
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,289
Pseudo-privatized.

28
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,230
That's a really good--

29
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,321


30
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:25,820
--good word.

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,550
Yeah.

32
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,870
--for all intents and purposes, it's treated as if it's privatized.

33
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,410
The owners of the land can sublease their land.

34
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,510
Above certain quotas, they're allowed to actually sell their extra produce

35
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,700
on the market.

36
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,150
So it essentially mirrors a basic market system,

37
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,185
but there's some basic government intervention.

38
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:47,330
Right.

39
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,660
So it becomes, once again, a family-run-- and now,

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,039
without landlords-- family-run, market-driven agricultural system

41
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,955
that really takes off.

42
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:04,830
An enormous boom in agricultural production, in the 1980s in particular.

43
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,970
Nadia?

44
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,650
And even though the government still controlled the land and owned it,

45
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,620
but after meeting the production goal as these farmers

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,090
could sell whatever excess they have at the market and gain profits.

47
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,160
So that helped the poverty rate decrease.

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,607
So in the '50s and '60s, there were quotas

49
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:27,940
that the state could take whatever it wanted, basically.

50
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,030
And did take everything in the late '50s and early '60s.

51
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,290
By the late '70s and '80s, the state quotas decreased very markedly.

52
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,580
There are still some, but you can market the rest.

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,720
And increasingly, it becomes a privatized agricultural economy.

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,860
You can invest in it.

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,350
But again, do you own the land?

56
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,360
Brian, if you're a farmer, and you've built up,

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,630
in the 1980s, a wonderful plot.

58
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,130
You're growing vegetables for downtown Shanghai.

59
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,460
And now people in Shanghai have the money to pay more for good vegetables,

60
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,720
and you can grow things, and so on.

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,820
And you want your son to inherit it.

62
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
What are his chances?

63
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,176
It's up to the government.

64
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:07,800
The government still owns it nominally.

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,150
And the person just works on it and has to make all the government--

66
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,270
Right, you don't know.

67
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,940
You really don't know.

68
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,830
Your family has a contract to do it, up to decades.

69
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,860
But you don't know for sure if your son-- who's likely to go to the city

70
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,020
anyway, because he wants to get out, and see the world,

71
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,160
and make more actual cash.

72
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,870
But you don't know for sure.

73
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,480
Rose-Ann, if I'm the government of X and Y township, and you have a farm,

74
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,750
but I really would like to expand a road through your farm.

75
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,130
What happens?

76
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,480
Then you get to expand the road.

77
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,265
I get to expand the road.

78
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,945
And you get to move.

79
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:53,486
And do you get compensated, Rose-Ann?

80
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:54,340
Yeah.

81
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,260
I think I do get compensated.

82
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,480
But I think that the government has the say,

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,720
in terms of evaluating the compensation rate.

84
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,060
Assuming that one knows, eventually, what the market price of this land

85
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,960
will be, what percentage do you think you get of the ultimate market price?

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,820
Once this land is built, the road goes through,

87
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,930
there are shopping malls on either side of it.

88
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,610
Probably not a lot.

89
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,484
Probably not a lot.

90
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:22,400
Anybody want to guess?

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,280
Kennedy?

92
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,590
Can I ask a quick question?

93
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,744
Sure.

94
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,910
They talked about in the text how it was problematic

95
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,076
that some people, like farmers, were selling their land to developers, which

96
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:33,290
is then further decreasing the amount of arable land.

97
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:33,790
Right.

98
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,420
If a farmer sold the land to a developer,

99
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,080
but then the government decided they wanted that plot of land,

100
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,163
say, to build a highway or something, could they destroy that development?

101
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,080
And who would be compensated?

102
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,610
In that case, the developer.

103
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,410
The developer would be compensated.

104
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,870
And it's perfectly possible, because the government

105
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,719
can take land more than once.

106
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,260
After all, there's only so much land.

107
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,030
And it's the largest source of income for local governments across China--

108
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,930
are land sales and resales.

109
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,080
But your farmer, your average-- and it's a statistic that is really

110
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,080
quite stunning, and it seems to be getting higher--

111
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,360
but in the last decade, so much farmland lost to development

112
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,860
by this kind of-- you know, my taking Rose-Ann's farm.

113
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,690
You would get, on average, about 2% of the ultimate market value of land

114
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,870
adjacent to large urban areas.

115
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,350
And then you have nothing to do.

116
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,410
So it's a very, very difficult situation.

117
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,370
And it's one of the reasons why a lot of people are moving to cities.

118
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:38,200
And Chinese agriculture is really under different kinds of stresses now.

119
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,900
So this return to family farming is a huge boost to productivity.

120
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,730
A one-time boost.

121
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,060
But it still doesn't solve the issue of who

122
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,220
invests in agriculture for the long haul.

123
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,030
Chaz?

124
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,691
I just have a quick question about-- I guess

125
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:59,190
Johnathan was talking about how the return to family farming

126
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,939
increased the productivity, because people

127
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,620
could sell their excesses to the market.

128
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,590
Right, and they could sell goods to go to real markets, yes.

129
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,130
Rather than just by state plan.

130
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,120
Why did the government still have the quotas?

131
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,230
What were the-- the crops that were being grown with the quotas,

132
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,854
where was that going?

133
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:19,390
If there was also a market.

134
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,290
So why would the government still have-- even, for example, a tax in grain,

135
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,514
that you would pay in grain.

136
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,430
Some percentage of it.

137
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,638
Why would it still have this?

138
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:30,350
As it would, until the late '80s, early '90s, in a significant way.

139
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,350
Why do you think?

140
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,694
It's a great question.

141
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,860
And I don't know that there's only one answer to it.

142
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,680
Zheyan?

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,770
Maybe the revenue was going to industrialization during that period.

144
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,990
So part of it is that agricultural productivity still

145
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,487
pays for industrialization, which is still state run.

146
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:52,570
Not much of it is exported by this period of time,

147
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,790
but it was in the '50s and '60s.

148
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,350
Probably another answer is that-- yeah, Nadia?

149
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,680
Could it be, like, in the Tang system, where it's, sort of, renting the land?

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,130
So they give them the land to use it, and that's

151
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:11,050
what the farmers pay to the government in exchange for using the land.

152
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,044
It is a kind of a rent.

153
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:12,960
You're thinking right.

154
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,060
You can think of-- all farmers are effectively

155
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,940
sharecroppers in this regard.

156
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,940
But the crops are shared with the state.

157
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,410
Why does the state need them?

158
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,160
Well, increasingly, it doesn't.

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,960
But you know, governments change policy, sometimes pretty slowly.

160
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,610
There were bureaucracies in place.

161
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,180
How long has there been a land tax in China?

162
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,440
This kind of tax in grain and so on?

163
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,340
Jake?

164
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,390
Centuries.

165
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,910
Over two millennia.

166
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,519
Two millennia?

167
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,310
Over two millennia.

168
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,101
Over two millennia.

169
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,449
How many millennia?

170
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:41,990
I don't know.

171
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,960
2.5.

172
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,510
2.5.

173
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,509
That's a great question.

174
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,720
But I have no idea.

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,912
Probably about 2.5.

176
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:48,870
At least two millennia.

177
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,590
Yeah, I think so.

178
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,220
2,600.

179
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,770
So you were oh, so close.

180
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,650
OK, and does China have a land tax today?

181
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,970
Henry, what do you think?

182
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,480
Does China have a land tax today?

183
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,185
No agriculture tax.

184
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:08,100
It was meant as a measure to relieve farmers of some burden,

185
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,270
especially inequality between rural and urban citizens.

186
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,700
So no agriculture tax.

187
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,780
For the first time-- not just in memory, but as far as we can tell, in history--

188
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,820
there is no agricultural tax.

189
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,905
That is, the taxing of agricultural goods going to the state.

190
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,780
And this was abolished by Premier Wen Jiabao.

191
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,810
A great reform, actually.

192
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,580
I think in 2006.

193
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,980
Now what it's like to be a Chinese farmer today?

194
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,770
Is it a good life?

195
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,270
Michael?

196
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,192
Well, it seems like there's a lot of migration to cities.

197
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:44,584
But they don't have a hukou, and so a lot of migrant workers,

198
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:52,050
in cities like Shenzhen, who don't have the same health care and schooling

199
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,040
and financial benefits.

200
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,394
And so it's sort of, like, an awkward position.

201
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:58,852
And it seems like a lot of the older people within families

202
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:01,420
are, sort of, staying behind in the rural areas.

203
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,880
So what kind of social benefits do farmers have already in China?

204
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,670


205
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,110
You move to cities, and you don't have-- you're right.

206
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,950
So there's obviously something going on, where

207
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,880
whatever your situation in the countryside is,

208
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,800
you believe it will be improved by moving, or having

209
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,950
some members of your family move, to new opportunities in the city.

210
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,950
And that's in part because there are more people

211
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,890
on the land than it needs in order to till them.

212
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,904
Kennedy?

213
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,695
The reading talked about how the government

214
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:36,376
was willing to pay for about nine years of education for farmers.

215
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,500
But for other living expenses and other costs, such as textbooks, clothing,

216
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,850
stuff like that, a lot of farmers couldn't afford it.

217
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,160
And in order to improve their standard of living, they tried moving to cities.

218
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,780
And then when they couldn't do that, it led to many problems.

219
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,390
OK.

220
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,190
Education is improved markedly.

221
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,730
In the early years of the People's Republic, before the famine,

222
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,370
rudimentary public health is improved markedly for farmers.

223
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,410
So education is there, but it's not free.

224
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,090
If you have no money for textbooks, it's very complicated.

225
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,490
What about health insurance?

226
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,010
Or other forms of social insurance?

227
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,900
Are there pensions for farmers?

228
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,975
No.

229
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,160
There are no pensions.

230
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,680
There's no social-- throughout most of the history of the People's Republic.

231
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,400
Despite it being an aspiration, a communist system,

232
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,662
there's absolutely no social security system for farmers.

233
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,620
There is one for urban residents-- particularly

234
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,320
for those connected with state-owned enterprises.

235
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,720
And there is not for farmers.

236
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,140
Until very recently, under Premier Wen Jiabao--

237
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,760
introduced an extraordinary plan to give every farmer a rudimentary health care.

238
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,120
What you might call a floor, under which you could not fall.

239
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,270
At least a foundation of health insurance, which one hopes

240
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,560
will be the building block of a much more grand system.

241
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,110
But it's very late in coming.

242
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,863
It really doesn't happen until the 21st century.

243
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,363
