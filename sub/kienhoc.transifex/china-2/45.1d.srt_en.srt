1
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,980
Today, many people look back on Deng Xiaoping as a key figure

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,630
in the second half of the history of the People's Republic

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,620
and think of him as the Great Economic Reformer.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,940
Every so often I hear people say, I wish today-- so 2013, 2014--

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,530
we had a political Deng Xiaoping, who could take the leadership

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:35,540
stand in politics for political change that Deng took in economics.

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,230
He was occasionally, when confronted with dissent-- Democracy Wall 1979,

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,890
and of course massively in 1989 in the Tiananmen demonstrations--

9
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,720
chose not to pursue political liberalization.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,630
Some would argue that the 1989 moment in China

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,230
is, as AJP Taylor once said for the German revolutions of 1848,

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,370
"a turning point in history where history failed to turn",

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,950
the opportunity to lead reform from the top.

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,550
How do you see it?

15
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,330
Or how do you think he saw it in 1989?

16
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:22,310
First of all, let me go back one step to the Democracy Wall in 1978, '79.

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,610
He was the one that started it.

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,570
He said, let it go.

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,010
So he was not instinctively against it.

20
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,600
What he was worried about, in such a chaotic country where

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,690
so many people were still starving, is that if you

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:42,160
allowed too much leeway, too much freedom that people would go to chaos.

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,070
And indeed, anybody who saw the chaos, even as recently

24
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,960
as the Cultural Revolution, who had the responsibility for guiding a country

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,630
would naturally worry about that chaos.

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,880
So in 1979, he felt that the chaos around the Democracy Wall

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,420
was getting too big.

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,540
And he moved it to another place where this was out of the way,

29
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,910
and which essentially closed it down.

30
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,169
Then in '86, again, he allowed Zhao Ziyang

31
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,730
to lead a study of political reform.

32
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,840
And it was a very broad-gauge study of how do you move a country.

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,630
It looked at the various socialist states,

34
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,360
how they were reforming within themselves.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,340
It looked at how Taiwan changed.

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,830
It looked at how other places changed.

37
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,320
And there was quite a broad scale of the study of it.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,560
And then the student movement, from his point of view, got out of hand.

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,650
There were demonstrations, particularly along the Yangtze Delta area, Shanghai,

40
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,960
Nanjing, Wuhan, and Beijing, of course.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,890
And he thought it was too dangerous.

42
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,770
So that was 1986.

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,230
And then, '89 was again the repeat of the same issue.

44
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,840
He hadn't stopped it right away.

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,230
He allowed people to go to the streets.

46
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,160
And for a few weeks there was no beginning to crack down.

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,090
In fact, it was the responsibility of others, like Zhao Ziyang,

48
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,000
to try to see that those things were kept under control.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,320
But on May 20, 1989, when he sent in the troops unarmed to try to restore order

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,400
and they could not restore order-- they were turned back--

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,930
he felt, at that point, that he had no choice.

52
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,090
So he sent the troops back to the outskirts.

53
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,380
Let them regroup.

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,210
And said, look, you have to do what is necessary to regain control.

55
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,030
He warned people to stay off the streets.

56
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,520
That they wanted to clear the streets.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,270
They were trying to regain order.

58
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,650
There were broadcasts to clear.

59
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,100
But they didn't clear the streets.

60
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,690
And a lot of people tried to use buses that they

61
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,850
would put across the path of the troops.

62
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,340
And the troops first fired in the air, warned.

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,270
And when people didn't move, they used weapons.

64
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,510
We don't know exactly how many people were shot in Beijing.

65
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,490
The estimates are several hundred.

66
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,990
There was a Canadian scholar who went to all the hospitals

67
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,422
and talked to a lot of officials and estimated maybe 700, 800,

68
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:10,070
900 people were killed.

69
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,990
But when you compare that with the number killed in a lot of other places,

70
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,820
from Deng Xiaoping's view-- who had a long view of history.

71
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,350
He had seen millions die in World War II, millions perish in the Cultural

72
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,150
Revolution, millions perish in the Great Leap Forward.

73
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,380
It was not something he wanted to do, but he felt, given the choices,

74
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,910
that his responsibility was to keep order and he would reestablish order.

75
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,250
And the people who were close to Deng feel that, now,

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,440
24 years after Deng, that he did keep order.

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,010
And that China has prospered and a lot of people's lives have improved.

78
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,680
And if chaos had continued, if they'd gone the way of the Soviet

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,660
Union, or the Philippines, or India, which had far more democracy,

80
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,000
people's lives would not have improved nearly as much as they did in China.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,250
And so, Deng's followers feel that he made the right choice.

82
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:20,598
