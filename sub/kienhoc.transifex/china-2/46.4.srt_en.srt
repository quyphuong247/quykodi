1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,202
Now, if you're Chairman Dhanin and say he were here--

2
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:16,910
and the first time I taught this case at Harvard Business School,

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,760
the chairman of several of his sons came for the teaching of the case.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,527
What would you worry about, and what advice

5
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:27,360
would you give him if you're looking to the future of this business?

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:27,860
Sarah?

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,259
Definitely accountability because the company is so huge at this point

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,340
that, if there's shoe in one of the areas,

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,360
you know that, because of this vertical integration, the company is to blame.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Like, you can't blame an outsider necessarily.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:41,860
OK.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,360
So a huge concern over quality.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,110
Yeah.

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,769
Particularly given the food safety scandals in China.

15
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,060
This is one of the reasons their reputation is so high,

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,170
but it has to be at the top of their agenda.

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,551
And plus, with the exports.

18
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,050
Right.

19
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,720
Michael?

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,060
Well, it seems China is no longer-- or at least quickly, no longer fitting

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,348
Dhanin's original market type, which is a early breaking market,

22
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:03,806
seeing at first we were advantaged.

23
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:06,578
But now looking more and more like the United States or Europe,

24
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:10,210
and that's a completely different market than someplace like in Southeast Asia

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,530
or in India.

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,950
So he might have to sort of go to new regions if he still wants to continue--

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,990
Ah, OK.

28
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,450
And I think that's probably good advice.

29
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,300
I'll pass it on.

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,800
OK.

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,455
Sachin.

32
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:24,591
Both foreign and domestic competitors.

33
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:25,090
OK.

34
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,050
So who would you worry about of domestic competitors?

35
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,833
It was--

36
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,690
Hope Group.

37
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,440
Was it the Hope Group?

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,615
Hope Group, that's right.

39
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:35,500
Was that one of them?

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:35,650
Yeah.

41
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,858
Hope Group is absolutely one.

42
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:38,529
And then Tyson Internationally.

43
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:39,445
Tyson Internationally.

44
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:40,470
So they have competitors.

45
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,636
They also have-- and I think, Julie, your point here

46
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,490
is a really, really good one.

47
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,580
Conflict with the state.

48
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,910
If they get too big, too rich, well, they're

49
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,460
very careful to give a lot back.

50
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,080
They're very socially conscious about their philanthropy and other things

51
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,550
and their political relations in order to be seen.

52
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:04,020
And they really do serve the people, but they do have-- with the huge food

53
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,160
conglomerate, they face State-Owned Enterprise competition

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,740
in a large area of food groups as well.

55
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,940
Anything else that you would advise him to worry and think about?

56
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,310
Then I'm going to show some pictures of their most extraordinary opportunity.

57
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,842
So Jasmine and then Zack, and then we'll show some pics.

58
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:27,184
To go back to the quality of the rise in people paying attention to sustainable

59
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:30,390
food because CP has an emphasis on scientific and technological

60
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,778
development, most of the foods that they produced aren't-- they don't fit this

61
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:41,550
new food trend of organic foods or sustainable food growing--

62
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,130
OK.

63
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,080
That's very good.

64
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,250
Zach, last comment on this.

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,140
The challenges they've always been facing

66
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,190
is just contending with production constraints.

67
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,690
Right.

68
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,050
And I think it's especially important in China

69
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,986
whereby, if the government decides that certain land is not

70
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:55,790
being used most productively, they could easily lose,

71
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,215
within China, a lot of their control over certain land

72
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,340
areas for another SOE, needs to do better.

73
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,200
Mm-hmm.

74
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,960
So there is the continuing uncertainty and constant worry

75
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,950
about agricultural policies, but they seem to be ahead of the curve.

76
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,700
And I think the lesson to draw here-- this

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,130
is an agricultural revolution of a modern Tsar that

78
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,525
is without a land revolution.

79
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:19,660


80
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,220
Is this a successful company?

81
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,230
It's unbelievably successful, and it's successful

82
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,350
because it's enriching itself.

83
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,710
It's enriching farmers.

84
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,070
Is it well-connected politically?

85
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,570
Investor number 001 Deng Xiaoping.

86
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,480
Not bad.

87
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,800
OK.

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,520
So would you invest in the CP Group?

89
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,420
How many think this is a good company to bet on?

90
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,600
But then let's go back to this question here.

91
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,370
What is happening?

92
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,180
The income disparity.

93
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,960
Informal income is growing between even these farmers and urban residents.

94
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,250
Is this in part because of what these guys are doing?

95
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,229
Or not?

96
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,520
Is it something to worry about?

97
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:06,810
Jake.

98
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,370
When the government's coordinating financial institutions like the China

99
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,244
Development Bank to provide loans which then allow farmers to acquire

100
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:17,640
the technology to industrialize and make their production more efficient,

101
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,000
that's what's going to be able to raise their income.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,655
So they're on a per capita basis producing more chicken provided

103
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:28,010
if they curve, like, 20 cents per chicken.

104
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,670
So if they were to, like, get it up to over 100,000 chickens,

105
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,980
they're actually able to earn, per capita income,

106
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,726
that's still a bit lower than--

107
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:35,225
No.

108
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,240
But it could be huge.

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,380
It could be in terms of farm-- Derek.

110
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,570
There's a huge oversupply of farmers.

111
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,360
Right.

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,480
And so if they're going to be involved in this,

113
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,313
presumably, they're going to be trying to make things more efficient

114
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:51,190
and trying to-- what little arable land is left to make that efficient.

115
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,810
And that's not going to help the oversupply of workers,

116
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,770
and, therefore, not going to help their--

117
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,580
You'll see and you'll read a lot of debates

118
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,940
about whether this kind of agribusiness is really good for farmers.

119
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,510
It will be good potentially for those who stay on the farm,

120
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,774
but Chinese farms can produce like this only if there are a lot fewer of them.

121
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:12,190
But you'll also hear debates-- and you should think about.

122
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,190
People say today-- it's absolutely true that the income levels of people

123
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,320
who are designated as rural people and urban people

124
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,670
continue to grow disparately and the income gap grows larger.

125
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,520
Larger than it has been in any time, but it has been possible to measure.

126
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,640
And some people will say things were better in the time of Chairman Mao.

127
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,480
In the time of Chairman Mao, we were equally poor.

128
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,010
The fact is, though, people were not equally

129
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,220
poor in the time of Chairman Mao.

130
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,660
Income was only one part of one's life, as it were.

131
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,930
And the biggest inequality, in the time of Chairman Mao,

132
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,610
was whether you were alive or dead-- something

133
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,890
that economists don't measure very easily in the statistics,

134
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,740
but worth contemplating.

135
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,310
The question that I would ask you-- which agricultural reform would

136
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,470
you favor if you had to choose, that of Chairman Mao

137
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,970
or that of Chairman Dhanin Chearavanont?

138
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:16,550
Two chairmen, one of whom is still transforming China's agriculture

139
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,060
and one of whom did not.

140
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,225


141
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,600
And then the last thing that we're going to do on Dhanin,

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,500
there's a very good quote that he has that I

143
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,380
think is totally worth remembering and it's true really

144
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,900
for much of Chinese history.

145
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,380
"A rich country cannot have poor farmers,

146
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,090
certainly not in the modern period."
