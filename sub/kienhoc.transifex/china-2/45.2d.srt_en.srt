1
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,170
It's one of the things that most impresses

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,030
foreigners when they go to China today.

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,960
You arrive, say, at the Pudong Airport, you

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,175
could take a maglev train toward downtown Shanghai

5
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:24,050
at 430 kilometers an hour.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,430
You get to Shanghai, spend a day or two-- say you want to go to Nanjing.

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,040
You take a high speed train to Nanjing.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,270
Nanjing and Shanghai are as far apart as Boston and New York.

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,820
Today most of the trains between Boston and New York

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,570
take about the same amount of time they took 100 years ago, so

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,530
around four hours.

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,821
I'd say it was a little faster.

13
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:46,300
So it's a little faster.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,190
When it works.

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,790
Yes.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,780
Same distance in China, one hour and 15 minutes.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,400
Big deal.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,230
It's a big change.

19
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,260
Blown away.

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,050
Here in Boston, our biggest infrastructure project

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,700
is a four mile extension of the Green Line, to Medford from Lechmere.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,975
You know, this--

23
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:05,475
Yeah.

24
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:08,750
You know, it's a 19th century trolley line.

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,770
Here we are in the second decade of the 21st century.

26
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,760
And it probably won't get built, because there are too many lawyers.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,250
This stuff gets built in China, it's impressive, moves people around.

28
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,020
What does it actually do for the economy?

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,140
Short term is clear.

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,450
Short term, big boosts in late '90s, late 2000s.

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,790
How do you judge it as an economist?

32
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,660
Well, there are a number of related things going on.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,580
First thing I think one notices is the first 10, 12 years

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,260
of these programs probably increase productivity, the economy.

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,940
The Soviet style of investment was to neglect transportation,

36
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,360
and China basically adopted that policy.

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,570
When you traveled in the countryside, the highways,

38
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,200
maybe the main trunk highway would be paved, but it would be two lanes.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,420
And all kinds of fairly major side highways

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,060
would be gravel, so there was a real neglect.

41
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,590
The railroads were the same, as they had been for a long time.

42
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,280
And you had all kinds of huge demand building up for--

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,780
Right.

44
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,080
Twice the number of people, for one thing.

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
And of course, the airports weren't much.

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,340
I mean, when I first went in '74, the Beijing Airport was probably smaller

47
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,474
than Morgan Hall.

48
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:33,974
Yes.

49
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:34,960
Right.

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,630
That's the hall where we're meeting here on the business call.

51
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,130
Yeah.

52
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,400
And so there was a huge gap in infrastructure

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,200
that China basically filled during this.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,810
So it went from having no high speed highways

55
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,120
to having around 50,000 miles of high speed highways.

56
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,230
Is a slightly longer, I believe, than the US interstate system.

57
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,480
Same basic idea, though.

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,726
We'll find out much later how good the quality is when it comes to-- I mean,

59
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,529
the issue is whether they can maintain it.

60
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:07,070
As you say, the high speed railroads.

61
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,320
They're going to have high speed railroads where

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,640
you can go almost anywhere in China on a high speed railroad for long distances.

63
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,240
I think the only time I took the train all the way from Hong Kong to Beijing,

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,270
I think it took us-- I think it must have been about 48 hours.

65
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,410
Now you can do it in-- you know, you can get to Guangzhou, anyway,

66
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,340
and whatever it is, probably eight hours, nine hours.

67
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,900
And Beijing to Shanghai in five.

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,400
Or less.

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,900
Yeah.

70
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,980
Yeah.

71
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,870
And of course, you have new airports.

72
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,690
Everybody has new airports.

73
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,250
You know, I've been to various provincial capitals

74
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,720
that you would never-- you know, Xining in Qinghai, Guiyang in Guizhou.

75
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,230
All with brand new, fancy airports.

76
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,440
Not that many airplanes coming into some of them.

77
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,900
I mean, these are quite big, modern buildings, very comfortable.

78
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,100
Built way ahead of demand.

79
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,680
But nevertheless, meeting a real need.

80
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,495
So that infrastructure program just across the board--

81
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:13,310
it was in some sense a necessity.

82
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:23,339
