On Revolution in China

1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,800
Yu Hua, in your wonderful wonderful book of essays,

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,280
"China in Ten Words"

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,320
one of the key words is "Revolution"

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,080
explain your argument that the revolution,

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,000
the worst of the revolution,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution,

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
are still driving the Market Revolution.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,560
You remind us of Mao Zedong's famous line

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,320
"a revolution is not a dinner party",

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,080
it's violent, it's propagandistic,

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,800
people suffer in a revolution and they have to.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,000
You say there's still suffering

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,880
from government violence

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,400
in bulldozing even parts of the most successful cities,

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,680
they're suffering from propaganda.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,560
Explain what you mean.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,480
My personal feeling is Chinese people just like revolutions.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:18,920
If you see the 3,000 years of history of China as a country

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,440
of course the Chinese government claims that

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,760
we have 5,000 years of civilization

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,840
however as a country, our history is about 3,000 years

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,480
if you see that history you can see the Chinese history

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,880
can be summarized in the way

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,880
you establish a dynasty and you overturn it,

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,800
you establish a dynasty and overturn it

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,680
this continued on through history.

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,360
What is the continuity, what is the thread

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,400
that connects the Great Leap Forward

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,240
the Cultural Revolution and the Market Revolution

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,120
the Capitalist Revolution

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,760
that we see all around us in Shanghai today

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,160
make those connections.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,200
I think the clue between the three revolutions

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,360
is that Chinese people just like revolutions.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,440
You can see that through the changing

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,320
of dynasties in Imperial China

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,760
from the destruction of the Qing dynasty and on

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,440
creating the Republic of China

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,560
this was a great revolution

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
an extremely violent revolution

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,640
and how the Communist Party beat the Guomindang

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,360
and established the Republic of China in 1949

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,840
this was yet another revolution.

44
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:38,840
The Great Leap Forward is another exaggerated,

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,680
you could even consider it a fictional economic revolution,

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,880
in actuality it was more of a movement

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,680
it was actually more of a political revolution

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,640
rather than an economic revolution.

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,240
How about the Cultural Revolution?

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,720
Of course the Cultural Revolution

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,200
is a pure political movement with violence,

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,000
however it is quite different from the overturning of the Qing dynasty.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,480
also different from how the Communist Party took power

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,840
from the Nationalist Party because

55
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,160
the Cultural Revolution was an internal revolution.

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's not look at China's history

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,040
our history is full of revolutions

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,560
from 1949 until now

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,120
that is in the 60 years that the PRC has been in power the revolution just goes on and on

60
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,000
it's just the way the revolution manifests and continues to change.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,360
The "Opening up and Reform" of our market economy was also a revolution in itself.

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,080
but this was purely an economic revolution.

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,240
In a lot of ways itâ€™s similar to the Great Leap Forward,

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:04:00,880
you can see all over China it's like a construction site.

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,280
All the buildings, all the houses were almost all torn down at the same time

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,560
and they were all built up again almost at the same time, big tall buildings all over the place

67
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,280
It's really hard to imagine this happening in any other part of the world

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,840
how can all of the cities be tearing down their old buildings at the same time

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,360
and build all their new buildings at the same time

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,480
in reality this can definitely be considered a method of revolution.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,200
So when we are building our economy it is certainly in a revolutionary style

72
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,840
highways are being built everywhere

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,320
at exactly the same time high speed railways are being built.

74
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm saying that everything is happening at exactly the same time

75
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,560
at the same time high rises are being build everywhere

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
they are building railroads

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,880
chemical factories are built at the same time

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,720
now up until now almost everywhere has started,

79
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,680
including our environmental pollution, air pollution,

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,280
how we solve the problem of environmental pollution

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,040
is a revolution by itself again

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,520
The ways we deal with the air pollution

83
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,400
as air pollution gets worse and worse,

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,600
our solution is almost like another revolution.

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,520
First cars are limited by their local government

86
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,800
to limit the cars on the road

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,600
for example based on your license plate number

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,560
you will know whether you can drive your car or not

89
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,880
and secondly the central government gives orders

90
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,240
to the local government that are very strict orders

91
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,560
that they have to improve their air quality

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
by a certain level by next year

93
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
or a certain number of years from now they have to achieve

94
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,280
a certain standard of air quality

95
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
it's almost like a revolution

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,240
that involves all the citizens of China.

97
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,560
I think that the most quintessential thing

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,320
about revolution in China is that

99
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,160
it involves all the citizens in this nation.

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,560
Basically that is a revolution.

101
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,040
For example in the Cultural Revolution

102
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,080
everyone is motivated to overturn the authority

103
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,560
and in the market transformation

104
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
everyone is motivated to make money

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,280
so making money also became a revolution

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,800
and then afterward everyone goes on

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,360
to corrupt money so it's also a revolution.

108
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,560
So I think China is a country that likes revolutions

109
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,680
Yu Hua, you write about three revolutions in your lifetime.

110
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,440
The Great Leap Forward, to industrialize

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,600
everybody turning in their pots and pans to make steel,

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,040
remembered now as a disaster,

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,680
the Cultural Revolution,

114
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,160
the Red Guard revolution,

115
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,640
a sort of mind control experiment,

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,400
that also was a disaster,

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,040
but you make a link also with the current revolution,

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,240
the money revolution,

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,480
the bulldozer revolution,

120
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,120
the skyscraper revolution.

121
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:10,240
What is it in the revolution today that troubles you?

122
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
Well what really troubles me about the revolution today

123
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,560
is not a secret in China anymore.

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
It's about the environmental pollution in China,

125
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,840
the air pollution in China,

126
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,040
the food safety in China

127
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,080
almost all the problems existing in today's society

128
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:41,040
are caused by an economy that because of its revolutionary development style is developing too rapidly.

129
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,560
You write that the new revolution,

130
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,280
like the old ones

131
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,200
is top down, few people deciding,

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,440
it's not democratic, also that it relies on violence

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,080
at some level or the threat of violence

134
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,240
bulldozers or bullets

135
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,560
and third that it's driven by propaganda.

136
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,880
You say that those big character posters

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
of the Cultural Revolution

138
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,600
have an equivalent today in advertising

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,280
in television bombardment.

140
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,800
Versions of the same thing.

141
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,160
I wish you'd explain it in your words.

142
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
Those three connections of top down

143
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,400
anti-democratic, also violent and also propagandistic.

144
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,080
Well there was also a bottom up revolution

145
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,560
that happened in China

146
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,880
that is the Tiananmen incident,

147
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,680
however it lasted for a really short time.

148
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:49,840
Where is that spirit today? Can we talk about that?

149
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,760
No, we couldn't talk about Tiananmen incident in China

150
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,520
now actually this year is the 25th anniversary

151
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,320
of the Tiananmen incident and

152
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,760
I actually didn't go take a look this year because

153
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:25,560
"Tiananmen" and "June the 4th" are banned online in China

154
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,920
actually for a while Chinese citizens

155
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,720
created a word called "May the 35th"

156
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:39,400
because it's May the 31st plus 5 days which makes June 6th

157
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,640
however the government rapidly found out

158
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,640
this great invention and this word is also became banned in China.

159
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:57,160
Everything related to the Tiananmen incident

160
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,680
is banned in China.

161
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:07,440
However there is one place online

162
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:19,920
you can see the things about this incident, and it is reported in Chinese

163
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,120
it's the official website of the American embassy.

164
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,000
And what can you see?

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,880
A very simple description, very few words about the Tiananmen incident

166
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,920
it says that how many years ago

167
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,320
there was democratic activity in China

168
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,600
and it ended in bloodshed.

169
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
And it expresses a remembrance

170
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,560
that is of China's democratic movement, very simple.

171
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,000
And I have a premonition

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,400
that as the Chinese Government's response becomes stronger

173
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,800
the description on the American embassy's website

174
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,800
will become shorter and shorter, simpler and simpler.

175
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,920
There might be one way that this wouldn't be changed

176
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,440
if Hillary Clinton became the President of the United States

177
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,040
And then what?

178
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,840
If Hillary Clinton became the President of the United States

179
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,080
I think that articles and reports

180
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,240
