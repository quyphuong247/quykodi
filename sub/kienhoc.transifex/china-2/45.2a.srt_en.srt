00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,995
I'm here with Dwight Perkins, the Herald Hitchings Burbank Professor

2
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:21,430
of Political Economy Emeritus, here at Harvard University, former Chair

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,600
of the Harvard Economics Department, long time

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,010
Director of Harvard's most ambitious international effort,

5
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,920
the Harvard Institute for International Development, former Director

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,740
of the Harvard University Asia Center and a long time scholar and observer

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,000
of China's economy.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,297
So Dwight, welcome.

9
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:45,130
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,900
It's nice to be here.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,860
And let me start with a question.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,820
We have many students today here at Harvard

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,230
who want to go and study China's economy, learn about China's economy,

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,670
because it's doing well and because some of them

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,640
think they can make a lot of money doing it.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,580
You started studying the Chinese economy when it was,

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,250
compared to its neighbors, a basket case.

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,230
Why did you do that?

19
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,720
Well, the slightly revised-- it wasn't a total basket

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,230
case when I started, because I started back in the mid 1950s.

21
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,320
And in fact, I wrote my senior thesis as an undergraduate.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,640
It was called Capital Formation in Communist China.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,910
And that was 1955, '56.

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,730
And at that time, China had actually achieved some stability

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,880
and was growing.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,220
Right after that of course, you've got the Great Leap Forward and everything

27
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,900
fell apart.

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,560
And I was living in Hong Kong at the end of the last year of the famine.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,970
But the reason I got into China studies had very little to do with that.

30
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,730
I got fascinated by China taking a course in Chinese history

31
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,479
in my freshman year at Cornell.

32
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,270
Knight Biggerstaff?

33
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,860
Knight Biggerstaff was the professor.

34
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,185
And I was getting as far away from my father's and grandfather's profession

35
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:12,180
of architecture, which the dean and I had agreed I had no talent for.

36
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,820
And I fell in love with the course.

37
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,440
I did badly on the second exam and got to know the professor as a result.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,870
He told me to think for three hours in studying

39
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,160
instead of memorizing for 20 hours.

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,880
And so I did much better.

41
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,450
And then I majored in-- I was Cornell's only major Far Eastern Studies.

42
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,070
Then I went to the Navy for two years.

43
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,780
But I had a Ford Foundation Fellowship.

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,690
They held it and I came back here to graduate school in 1958.

45
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,190
And that's when I really got-- I had some economics before I got here,

46
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,720
but I really got serious about economics when I was here,

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,900
but it was still all China oriented.

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,140
So you came back to study China and economics

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,830
just at the moment when the Chinese economy was then going over the cliff.

50
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,420
It was definitely going over a cliff.

51
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,030
One of the things when we were living in Hong Kong in '61 and '62

52
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,370
and I was writing my Ph.D. thesis, one of the things I did was I

53
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,570
would go talk to some of the people coming in from all across the border.

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,680
There was a brief period in I think it was early '62, late '61, early '62,

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,560
where the British guards on the border, or the Chinese guards at the border I

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,550
should say, stopped firing, stopped shooting people trying to get across.

57
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,840
And the word got through the informal network,

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,440
all through Guangdong province, and all of a sudden tens of thousands of people

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,420
started flooding in.

60
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,160
So there were a lot of people to talk to.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,660
I only spoke Mandarin and not that well to begin with.

62
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,800
So I had to be selective and talk to the people who came from further away

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,425
than Guangdong.

64
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:56,230


65
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,400
But, it was still-- China was a fascinating country.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,530
It had a fascinating history, its history

67
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,120
was certainly bloody as well, some of it.

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,850
And this period was a particularly grim period.

69
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,360
And the bigger problem was that they stop publishing data

70
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,820
for the 1960s and '70s.

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,829
And so you really had to work hard to get

72
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,470
any sense of what was really going on.

73
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,400
But you could do it by reading the materials and so on.

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:32,020
When thinks about the Chinese economy in 1949 and compares it with 1979.

75
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,160
One way to look at it is to compare China with--

76
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,020
or at least parts of China, say eastern central China to areas

77
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,550
not far from it, Korea, in which you'll have two different stories, or Taiwan,

78
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,400
of course, Japan, as well.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,900
Now it's arguable, I think, that in 1949 China

80
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,670
is not as far developed as Taiwan.

81
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,960
Oh, certainly not, no.

82
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,900
But it's not as far behind as it would find itself in 1979.

83
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:09,470
It loses its speed and loses-- the rest of East Asia rushes ahead

84
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,760
or a lot of it does, not all of it while China makes some progress,

85
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,920
but by no means takes off in the way that the tigers, the so-called Tigers

86
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,160
of East Asia do.

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,720
How would you assess the kind of strengths and weaknesses,

88
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,980
I know this is a big question, of the '49, '79 period.

89
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,610
Well, the first thing that they did initially,

90
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,630
was they brought stability, some degree of stability to the society,

91
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:47,360
and therefore you could get production back up and running.

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,880
And that happened fairly quickly in the '40s.

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,070
And then they-- but then, of course, they

94
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,300
begin introducing the whole centrally planned command

95
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,170
Soviet style economy and collectivized agriculture.

96
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:07,800
And that was largely completed by 1955, '56.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,500
But it was completed in a relatively smooth way,

98
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,615
as contrasted to the Soviet Union, where the collectivization of agriculture

99
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:17,800
led to millions of deaths and so on.

100
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,290
That did not occur in China.

101
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,510
So, you would have said as of 1957, '58 that the Chinese economy was certainly

102
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,720
much more successful.

103
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,280
And the data that we have now and to some degree even

104
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,220
had then, suggested it was actually doing fairly well,

105
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,550
nothing like after '78.

106
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,770
But then after '57, there is this disruption, the official figures

107
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,880
that the Chinese publish, say it still growing at about 6% a year

108
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,480
through this whole period.

109
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,500
Not true.

110
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,570
That is because the GDP, the gross domestic product data,

111
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,480
are distorted by the way the prices they used,

112
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,520
and exaggerate the importance of industry.

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,330
So the real growth rate was probably 2% per capita per year,

114
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,804
which is not terrible, except that none of it was going, or almost none of it

115
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:13,220
was going to people's consumption.

116
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,460
It was going to increasing investment.

117
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,780
The data are fairly clear that the growth rate was just under 4%,

118
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,020
population was growing at 2%.

119
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,070
So per capita GDP was growing, but then you

120
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,340
went and looked at the standard of living

121
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,960
of most of the people in the countryside, for example,

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,260
and it wasn't improving at all.

123
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,340
The city population probably had some improvement,

124
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,920
although one of the things we'll get to later, after 1957

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,600
there was an almost no housing built.

126
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,060
And so you ended up in 1978 with the typical family of three

127
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,700
having about 18 square meters of housing.

128
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,910
And that's 180 square feet and that often included the kitchen,

129
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,300
it included where they slept and so on.

130
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,160
So there just wasn't much change and improvement in the standard of living.

131
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,150
There was some industrialization.

132
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,900
There was the development of nuclear weapons and missiles and so on.

133
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,640
But very little that actually benefited people.

134
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:23,531
