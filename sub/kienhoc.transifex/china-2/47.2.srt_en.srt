1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:09,540
Jasmine, what do you think?

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,400
It seems to be the first global Chinese firm.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,290
OK, it's a global Chinese firm.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,280
Maybe not the first.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,070
But it depends on what you think of the Hong traders, who

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,007
were doing global business in the 19th century.

7
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,465
But it is a global Chinese company.

8
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,530
That absolutely interests me, without question.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,030
When was Wanxiang founded?

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,550
In 1969.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,290
Was that during the Great Leap Forward?

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,630
No, after.

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,534
When was the Great Leap Forward?

14
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:39,490
All right.

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,620
A little chronology here goes a long way, guys.

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,810
Great Leap Forward, 1958 to 1961, zuo you (more or less), or '62.

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,070
This catastrophe that cost the lives of 40 to 50 million Chinese.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,870
It's during the Cultural Revolution, the dates of which are normally

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:04,260
given as '66 to '76, 10 years, more or less.

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,320
So not during the Great-- but during the great proletarian cultural--

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,300
and what's the exact date?

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,910
Kelly?

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,860
1969.

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,250
1969, OK.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,710
So Kelly, is 1969 a good year to start a company in China?

26
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,530
No.

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,862
Why not?

28
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:29,535
Well, they were still kind of recovering after the Great Leap

29
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:31,530
Forward, which was a huge disaster.

30
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,500
Right.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,740
And they were kind of-- since they were in the middle of the Cultural

32
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,040
Revolution, there was a lot of turmoil going on through the country.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,928
There was a lot of turmoil, OK.

34
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:46,740
You want to start a company, to make money.

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,950
Is this a time that promotes private enterprise?

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,470
No, everything is state-owned.

37
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,520
There's no private enterprise, none.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,590
Yeah, Zack?

39
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,580
But the question is that you're saying, like is it a good time to start,

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,650
because at the same time, although like--

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,690
Talk about getting in on the ground floor.

42
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,040
No one else is doing this.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,160
Yeah.

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,076
Well, you have so many competitive advantages,

45
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:10,850
if you are able to be a support in the oligopoly.

46
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,267
For example, the universal joints.

47
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,016
There's only three companies that can have

48
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:15,540
that, that role in producing those.

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,610
If you were able to actually enter the market at that time--

50
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,290
OK.

51
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,105
It's also like a huge advantage at the same time.

52
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,980
We'll get to the universal joint in a minute.

53
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,710
Because that's what ultimately distinguishes this company.

54
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,020
But it's really a very, very good point.

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,825
In 1969-- what else happens in 1969?

56
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:36,920
It's a good year in other parts of the world.

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,200
The Mets win the World Series, I remember as a kid, and enjoying that.

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,400
So who's good number one in 1969, in China?

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,970
Robert?

60
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,470
Mao.

61
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,860
Mao, of course.

62
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,825
But who's his number two?

63
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:56,340
Zhou Enlai?

64
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,824
Not really.

65
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:58,630
Henry?

66
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,070
The guy who flew the plane into Mongolia?

67
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,300
Lin Biao.

68
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,510
So it's the height.

69
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,850
Really it's kind of one of the most radical heights.

70
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,610
Lin Biao, as defense minister, the man who

71
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,620
is enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

72
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,670
The man who made the little red book famous.

73
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,280
The man who proclaimed that Chairman Mao was the great helmsman.

74
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,390
The sailor of the seas.

75
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,300
The man who was-- Lin Biao was named in the Constitution of 1969,

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,050
in the Constitution as Chairman Mao's close comrade in arms and successor.

77
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,930
And he emphasized to kind of more radical turn,

78
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,620
at least early on, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.

79
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,590
And he was the one who in some sense allowed-- he didn't allow it to happen,

80
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,150
but enabled it, in a very large way.

81
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,550
He is now number two on the way to be successor;

82
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,350
although in a couple of years, he would alledgedly try to kill Mao,

83
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,790
and things wouldn't be so hot.

84
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,790
And they'd be very unpleasant for Lin Biao, who apparently died in 1971.

85
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,940
Nevertheless it's at a high point of the Cultural Revolution.

86
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,050
The military is a very, very strong.

87
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,980
They're repressing different factions that

88
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,810
have come up during parts of the Cultural Revolution.

89
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,550
It's just not a great investment time.

90
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,210
He starts in 1969.

91
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,572
And what is organiz-- do you remember what town?

92
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:28,250
Dishe, you were about to raise your hand, and then I zapped you.

93
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,450
What town?

94
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,450
Ningwei?

95
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,760
What town is he-- or what city, what realm?

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Hangzhou.

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,810
OK.

98
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:46,894
He's actually not in 1969, in Hangzhou, but he's not far from it.

99
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:50,110
He's outside of Hangzhou, in a place called--

100
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,102
Ningwei.

101
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:52,590
Ningwei.

102
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,562
I said that first.

103
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,062
Did you?

104
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,050
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,310
My apologies.

106
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,010
OK.

107
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,432
Have you been to Ningwei?

108
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:04,376
Dishe?

109
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,792
Anybody been to Ningwei.

110
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:09,320
I've been Ningwei, actually three to four times now.

111
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,710
But it's not actually the same-- it doesn't quite

112
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,190
look the same as once it did, when Mr. Lu.

113
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,340
And then what, Dishe, what else would you

114
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,730
say about what's happening in Ningwei?

115
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,320
What is this company founded in?

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,920
So one of the most interesting things is the context

117
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,690
in which they found themselves.

118
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,670
1969 would have not been a very good time

119
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,670
to start a business because everything was centrally planned.

120
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,930
And therefore, what this meant was no free market

121
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,659
operations really existed in that if they started a business

122
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,700
they were restricted in where they could source their raw materials from.

123
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,642
Uh huh.

124
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,530
Because they have to have a quota for that.

125
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,440
And also, where they could sell their end products into.

126
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,030
So it was quite interesting how, despite this context existing,

127
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,950
that they were still able to set up their-- OK,

128
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,810
and the second nuance was that no private companies as such were allowed

129
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,410
to take--

130
00:05:59,410 --> 00:05:59,660
Right.

131
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,909
So it's not a private company.

132
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,240
What kind of company is it?

133
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,740
It's a TVE.

134
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,050
It's a TV-- it's what becomes later, a TVE.

135
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,180
What does that mean?

136
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,680
Patrick?

137
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,590
I think it stands for a town and village enterprise.

138
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,923
Township and village enterprise.

139
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,730
So owned by the collective as it were.

140
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,140
The township and the village.

141
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,490
It's a form of socialist enterprise.

142
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,350
But in this period, the predecessor has actually a different name.

143
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,290
And it becomes a TVE.

144
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,560
It's called a commune and brigade enterprise.

145
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,610
So a she dui qiye in Chinese.

146
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,258
So it's in a people's commune, of the kind that Chairman Mao started in 1959,

147
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:37,560
'58, '59.

148
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,135
So it's in a people's commune.

149
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:44,130


150
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,230
So what's a commune?

151
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,230
A collective.

152
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,980
It's a collective.

153
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,030
It's a people's commune.

154
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,520
It's founded in a renmin gonshe, a Chinese people's commune in 1969.

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,780
So as a historian, I would be really interested.

156
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,160
Mr. Lu get a big bank loan to get started, Howard?

157
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,470
Well, he had, no.

158
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,078
He had $510 US dollars in capital equivalent.

159
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,536
And that brings me to my question--

160
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:10,524
Which is a lot for then.

161
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:11,940
I'm sorry, was that your question?

162
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,439
No.

163
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,310
My question was, it speaks of my ignorance of people in China

164
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,270
during this time.

165
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,824
But I was under the impression that everything is allocated to the people.

166
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:22,323
Right.

167
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:26,090
And I was just wondering, when you say capital, is this in RMB?

168
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,760
Did he get cash?

169
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,440
This is semi-private enterprise, how does-- is he part chairman?

170
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,390
Or is there still currency that people can buy things--

171
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,970
Very good.

172
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,616
These are excellent questions.

173
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:39,240
Who can answer?

174
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,130
They're really good questions.

175
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,450
I can answer them, but someone else should.

176
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,880
You said-- it's a good question.

177
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,590
We don't know from the case, but maybe we

178
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,740
can find out from Ni Pin later on where this $500 miraculously comes from.

179
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,720
Because it is a substantial sum of money in 1969 in China.

180
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,280
But presumably from the village, presumably from relatives,

181
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,130
from friends and so on.

182
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,681
So that would be one possibility of this.

183
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:08,680
What is he trying to do?

184
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,380
What kind of company is he trying to start?

185
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,947
Well, it was a farm tool repair shop.

186
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,280
So that gives you a little hint.

187
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,460
Ningwei is a farming village.

188
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,960
Yes.

189
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,460
Right, it's a farming village.

190
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,785
And they want to make some money by repairing

191
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:27,870
farm equipment that frequently breaks.

192
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,509
Yeah, it just seems like there was an unmet need by the state,

193
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,300
like in the market.

194
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,169
Exactly.

195
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,867
So the state can make tractors, but it doesn't repair it.

196
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,769
Right, but my question is, were they still--

197
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,840
were they charging for their services?

198
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,258
People were trading RMB, or was everything all allocated, and therefore

199
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,470
bartered.

200
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,970
Right.

201
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,178
That's an excellent question.

202
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:50,040
It's not in the case one would assume that there

203
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,450
is some financial transaction.

204
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,200
Because otherwise, you would have to in order to stay in business.

205
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,130
But it would happen through the commune, not necessarily through Mr. Lu himself.

206
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,770
But it isn't in the state system.

207
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,645
So it isn't a matter of Hangzhou or Zhejiang,

208
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,850
or the central government allocating tools to him

209
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,846
to repair tractors that are allocated by somebody.

210
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:15,070
Not from a ministerial point of view.

211
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,190
It's really happening very close on the ground.

212
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,730
And it's one of the large questions.

213
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,050
One of the reasons why I agreed to write this case, when I first did,

214
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,370
is the question of what kind of enterprise is this?

215
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,250
It's a commune and brigade enterprise?

216
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,790
Is it a public enterprise?

217
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,240
In ownership terms it is.

218
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,790
But is it a private enterprise?

219
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,800
In reality, in order to get some income into this miserably poor village.

220
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,860
A village that had suffered a lot during the 1950s and early 1960s,

221
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,880
particularly in the Great Leap period.

222
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,960
What is about a company that starts by then?

223
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Sachin?

224
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,920
It may be unique in China, with the emphasis

225
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,710
that it placed on human capital.

226
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,440
And then also it underwent a major crisis

227
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,080
and came out of that successfully.

228
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,850
OK.

229
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,840
So you don't write a business case-- and that's

230
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,170
a really good point-- unless there's a big issue or decision point to come.

231
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,240
This is a company that has had major challenges-- overcome them all,

232
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,674
but major decision points.

233
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:15,840
Those are among the reasons.

234
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,506
I'll give you a few others why I did it.

235
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:20,340
I was actually introduced to it by students.

236
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,290
I took a bunch of Harvard Business School students to China.

237
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,300
And they said, you really need to look at this company.

238
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,206
Students almost always are ahead of the game, compared to faculty.

239
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,330
They said, you really need to look at this company,

240
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,420
and take a look at what's going on.

241
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,312
The Chinese automobile industry is certainly

242
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,270
one reason why one would be interested in this.

243
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,940
Why is this industry important?

244
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,790
It's one of the industries that the Chinese government has really

245
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,430
sought to make one of their main industries,

246
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,750
to help propel them into the modernized world.

247
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,980
And it's one that they for a long time were

248
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,720
trying to use to make them competitive.

249
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,220
OK.

250
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,630
So it's government-supported, in part.

251
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,970
Is it a fast growing industry, a slow growing industry?

252
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,086
Anybody?

253
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,170
Jackie, what do you think?

254
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,950
Well, initially it was a tight industry when they cut down a large market,

255
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,230
or a large portion of the market.

256
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,760
So they had to work hard to actually stay in the market in the first place,

257
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,530
by monitoring quality control.

258
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,460
OK, the company-- but would you say, are there a lot of cars made in China?

259
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,940
Not particularly.

260
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,530
Not particularly.

261
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,936
Have you ever been in traffic in China?

262
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,190
I've had.

263
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,810
Anybody?

264
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,549
Are there a lot of cars in China?

265
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:34,590
Definitely a lot of cars.

266
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,590
How many?

267
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:42,074
No, don't-- Are there more cars made in China than say, in the United States?

268
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:43,012
I would say.

269
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:43,970
Yeah, the answer's yes.

270
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,290
China's the largest car manufacturer in the world.

271
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,800
It was not at all-- of course, Jackie was talking about in an earlier period.

272
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,250
It was not at all in the beginning of this period.

273
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,980
But it is today, the largest automobile industry in the world.

274
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,920
And these guys are the largest auto parts manufacturers,

275
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,910
in the largest cars automobile manufacturing country in the world.

276
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,110
So that's another reason.

277
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,945
What about this guy?

278
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,070
Why do you think I might be interested in this guy?

279
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,534


280
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,700
This is one of the reasons that drove me to do this.

281
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,250
Who is this man?

282
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,902
