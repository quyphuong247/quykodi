1
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:13,790
BILL KIRBY: Well, welcome to Shanghai.

2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,680
As you can see as we look out the window,

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,460
it's not a blue-sky day here in Shanghai.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,520
Not the worst day, either, in terms of air pollution.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,000
And I'm here with two people who can help talk about China's energy

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,620
and environmental challenges.

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,220
Immediately to my right is professor Mike McElroy,

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,320
who is the Gilbert Butler Professor of Environmental Studies at Harvard.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,520
He is the Founding Director of the University Center

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,580
for the Study of the Environment.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,390
And he is also the Founding Director of the Harvard China

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,070
Project on the Environment at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,140
And Chris Nielsen, who is the Executive Director of the China Project,

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,020
who has published widely on Chinese environmental issues--most recently

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,410
in a book called Clearer Skies Over China.

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,820
Can't quite see it today, Chris.

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,660
We look out onto the newest part of Shanghai here, Pudong,

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:21,370
the Oriental Pearl to our background, and one of the great cultural icons

19
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,930
of contemporary China, the Apple Store, but that's not why we're here.

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,150
Harvard has been active in the study of the environment in China

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,560
not just the last two, three, or four years, but at least 15 years.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,860
So welcome, Mike.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,190
Welcome, Chris, to ChinaX.

24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,130
Mike, if you could start off about how did you begin this project?

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,970
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: I think when Neil Rudenstine became President of Harvard,

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,280
you and I remember at that time there was essentially

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,270
no interaction in different schools at Harvard.

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,740
Neil Rudenstine had the idea that it was really

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,370
important to try to bring the university together,

30
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,770
and he thought that a theme such as the environment

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,220
might be a way in which people from the Business School,

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,580
Medical School, Public Health, Arts and Sciences and so on,

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,130
could talk to each other.

34
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,500
And so he asked me to chair a committee to examine this possibility.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,320
So along the way we started thinking about how do you really

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,230
get people at Harvard, who are all very busy, to talk

37
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,980
to each other in a serious way?

38
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,270
So you have to find some interest that will engage them

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,820
and where they go learn from each other.

40
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,010
So recognizing the incredible strength that Harvard has traditionally

41
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,220
in Chinese scholarship, it seemed to me a good idea

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,570
to actually pick China as a theme to work with.

43
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,630
So why China, other than these considerations?

44
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,980
Well, the second thing was it was really clear

45
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,122
15 years ago that the future of the global environment

46
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:48,080
was going to depend in a significant measure on what happened in China.

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,412
So that was basically the theme we started to look at.

48
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:53,370
BILL KIRBY: And did you have from the beginning

49
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,162
Chinese collaborators to work with?

50
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:57,120
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: The idea from the beginning

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,870
was that it was not going to work if it was simply

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,860
Harvard telling China what to do.

53
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,810
So it had to be China scholars and US scholars

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,590
working together to try to develop a common view.

55
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,710
And so as we started to think about this in the beginning we were very

56
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,845
fortunate to get very strong support from Song Jian, who was at that time

57
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:22,005
a very senior figure in the Chinese government,

58
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:26,347
say a counselor, who came to Harvard who gave a public talk.

59
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:28,680
Talking to him about what we wanted to do, I said, look,

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,154
it would be really nice if we could actually bring Harvard scholarship

61
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:33,570
together to learn more about that.

62
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,320
And his comment, which I will never forget

63
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,480
what he said, "China needs to learn more about China, and you guys can help us

64
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,150
do that."

65
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,360
Building on that, we've had strong collaborations

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,120
with Beida, with Qinghua, with other universities,

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,890
with people in the Academy of Sciences, people in the social sciences,

68
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,200
and essentially across the government, so it's

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,162
been a very exciting experience.

70
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:57,960
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: The goal of interdisciplinary collaboration

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,530
Mike just alluded to, the establishment of the Center for Environment

72
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,390
and the China Project under that, it has an interdisciplinary mission.

73
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,970
And so through this program, these issues that we're talking about

74
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,740
are inherently extremely interdisciplinary.

75
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,329
It's been personally gratifying, but also certainly relevant

76
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,445
to the topic that we're working on to be establishing ties

77
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:25,430
to people across different universities, different departments,

78
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,460
across disciplines.

79
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,837
BILL KIRBY: What's special about the challenges that we face here in China?

80
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,920
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: When you talk about China, you have to begin with scale.

81
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,400
China is gigantic.

82
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,840
It's a gigantic population.

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,650
It's a gigantic economy and it is growing so fast.

84
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,670
And the energy demands to feed that economic growth are so huge that you're

85
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,137
really facing a massive challenge in terms

86
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:55,900
of finding ways to reconcile economic development

87
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,290
with environmental protection.

88
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,430
And so it sort of dwarfs the challenges in other countries.

89
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,840
As Mike also alluded to, the global implications of that are tremendous.

90
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,420
We should not fail to recognize that the US

91
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,930
responsibilities on these global issues are also enormous

92
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,660
and we have had a huge global impact ourselves in our own country.

93
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,510
But actually thinking about the global problems

94
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,260
in the context of how the US and China engage on it

95
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,370
is actually fundamental to responding to global problems.

96
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,160
And when we say "global problems," we're mainly talking about climate change.

97
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,868
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: The significant point

98
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:44,030
is that this is a time that is completely

99
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,889
unprecedented in human history.

100
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,180
You can go back and think of the Industrial Revolution.

101
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,210
The Industrial Revolution involved a relatively small number of people

102
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,100
and it was relatively localized in terms of its impact.

103
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,490
And if you think of the post World War II world, again,

104
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,960
rapid development but still dwarfed by what's

105
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,960
been happening since 1979 in China.

106
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,460
So we have a situation where we have 1.3 billion people, an economy that

107
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,680
has been growing close to double-digit levels

108
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,930
for 30 years, an economy that is now consuming more

109
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,160
coal than any country in the world, whose demand for oil

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,580
is exceeded only by the United States and will soon exceed the United

111
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,317
States, which produces more carbon dioxide that

112
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:34,150
changes the climate than any other country in the world, more sulfur

113
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,780
dioxide, and on and on and on.

114
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,810
Produces more iron ore, produces more steel.

115
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,785
So how do you deal with that particular issue is a very serious problem.

116
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:47,890
And so I think that the climate change issue, which is now global,

117
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,960
what happens in China and what happens in the US

118
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,780
is key to the future of the world, in my opinion.

119
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,090
What we're trying to do at Harvard and in China

120
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,640
is to engage young people in thinking about these issues in a highly

121
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,420
interdisciplinary way.

122
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,410
Because we're not going to solve the problems by any single approach.

123
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,650
It's going to have to be a multitude of approaches

124
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,650
if we're going to really deal with these issues.

125
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,020
I think the serious problem for China is that the country's energy

126
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,740
system is almost completely dependent on coal at the moment.

127
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,600
70 percent of the primary energy is coal.

128
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,105
Embedded in that is the air-quality problems that go with using coal.

129
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:29,355
But also embedded in that is something I don't think very many people realize,

130
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:32,890
which is that China doesn't have a lot of coal.

131
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,450
If you actually estimate, given China's coal reserves,

132
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,240
how long can China keep using coal at its current growth rate,

133
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,420
the answer is 15, 18 years?

134
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,535
So what happens to a country that actually runs out of its primary energy

135
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:46,355
source?

136
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:50,030
Now it seems to me the Chinese government is aware of this particular

137
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,230
issue and is looking at a variety of ways to try to deal with it--developing

138
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,880
wind power, developing solar, developing nuclear, developing hydro,

139
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,490
investing in energy resources in Africa and the Middle East.

140
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,494
It's essentially a full-bore attempt to really deal

141
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:09,660
with the problem that is going to come crashing down

142
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,310
in a very short period of time.

143
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,704
