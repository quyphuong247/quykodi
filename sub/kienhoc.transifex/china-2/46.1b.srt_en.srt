[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,020
Josh, what would you say?

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,811
Substance, farming.

4
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:17,050
Just like people farming enough for themselves.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,950
Subsistence farming, for many people that would be true.

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,400
But was there surplus in this farming system, you imagine?

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,590
Are there exports that come from Chinese farming?

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,770
There's no surplus.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,680
So Julia has lost her voice, friends, but she is not

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,430
short of communication skills.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,770
So thank you, Julia.

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,000
She says there is no surplus.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,840
That's an interesting question.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,180
There's a big debate about the nature of pre-Communist agriculture.

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,400
I was going to say, are you in favor of surplus?

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,620
Because due to the surplus that was when they

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,030
began to collectivize agriculture and try

18
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,505
to redistribute all the surplus and excess land.

19
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:54,850
So there is excess, that is to say, if properly mobilized.

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,090
Because in Communist plans after 1949, that

21
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,720
is taken by the state, mostly exported to the Eastern Bloc

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,460
to pay for industrialization.

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,151
At least, there's a belief in the state that there's export.

24
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:07,650
Zack?

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,020
I was going to add more to just the over all state of agriculture before 1949.

26
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,310
Most of it was organized into groups of land owned by a certain landlord,

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,890
so it wasn't as equitably distributed as post 1949.

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,560
That's also a big debate.

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,350


30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,480
Landordism surely defined, in many ways, some forms of landlordism property

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,040
rights, and property holdings in China.

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,100
Would you think-- how would you-- is it a huge issue?

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,790
Are these large landowners?

34
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,290
Jasmine?

35
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,145
The peasants were definitely oppressed under the landlords.

36
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,995
Because the landlord did have a lot of power, especially regionally.

37
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:51,894
And I assume that they did have a lot of land because they had a lot of power.

38
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:53,560
They didn't have actually a lot of land.

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,670
Your average landlord in China would be a suburbanite in Boston.

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,470
That is to say--

41
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,900
Absentee land-holding?

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,250
There is some absentee land-holding and so on.

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,880
But this is not at all like Russia, or Prussia, or Poland,

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,740
or the great estates of France, or even of Britain, there's no serfdom.

45
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,970
Most land holders, most land owners, have a few acres or more.

46
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,840
Zack, I'm sorry, you wanted to come in.

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,506
There's two problems as I see with that.

48
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:27,172
Because first, when you limit, when you have large families continuing

49
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:30,130
that hold, even if it's small plots of land, you limit social mobility.

50
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,560
But at the same time, because of the multiple separate plots,

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,685
you can't produce in scale.

52
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:36,180
So you sort of lose efficiency.

53
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,360
OK.

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,810
You have multiple small plots, that's true,

55
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,240
mostly farmed by farming families.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,750
Richer families can be extended families.

57
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,530
Landlordism is there, but it's not at all

58
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,650
the kind of Marxist conception of landlord

59
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,809
as Marx understood the problem of so-called feudal landholdings in Europe

60
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:56,350
at that time.

61
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,830
It's a quite different thing.

62
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,288
As Sun Yat-sen put it, and I've forgotten the exact phrase,

63
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:04,470
but China had poorer, and less poor, and more poor farmers,

64
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,950
but it didn't have a large number of very rich people.

65
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,450
Michael?

66
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,840
Speaking about poor and rich, it seemed like before 1949 there

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,900
was perhaps less inequality between rural and urban,

68
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,495
mostly because it seems like, after 1949, with the hukou system,

69
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:27,840
it sort of differentiated a lot of the sort of legal rights and benefits

70
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,760
that urban citizens get versus rural citizens.

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,580
And that didn't really exist before 1949 to such an extent.

72
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,299
Well, that's a really good point that I hadn't really

73
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,590
thought to bring out right now.

74
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,650
But where do the elites come from throughout most

75
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,840
of the periods of Chinese history that we've talked about?

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,560
They end up in the cities, but where do they grow up?

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,480
Suburbs.

78
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,240
No suburbs, not yet.

79
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,800
I think it's basically anywhere you could take exams.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,150
Anywhere you could take exams.

81
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,170
Obviously, they're from cities, but they tend to be landed.

82
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,900
They do tend to come-- land is the most, then and today,

83
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,340
is some of the most enduring form of wealth.

84
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,980
And it's the biggest part of the gross national product,

85
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,390
really until very recently in China.

86
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,950
And so many elites come from, what we would call today, rural families, which

87
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,910
did not mean that they were in any sense backward, or less developed,

88
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,060
because they were highly educated.

89
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,931
And that's flipped entirely in the 20th century.

90
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,430
Sarah?

91
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,420
Would you say that these rural families were not necessarily of a higher

92
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,439
social status, but because their children took the exams

93
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,480
and then they advanced through that system they--

94
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,004
Right.

95
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,170
If you pass the exam, whether you're urban or rural,

96
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,130
you become at a higher social status.

97
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,220
And it would be very typical for a family to have one or another son

98
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,760
pass through the examination system, another one

99
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,050
manage the family enterprises, including land-holdings, and others.

100
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,620
We're talking about elite families.

101
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,800
Who owns historically the land in China?

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,024
Alex?

103
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:02,308
Today, in the sense of the beginning of the People's Republic,

104
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,790
the government owns the land, or the communes own the land.

105
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,440
OK.

106
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:14,720
So today government owns land, or at least individuals

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,600
don't, some political entity owns the land.

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,750
And is this-- just to make sure that we're

109
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,260
on the same page-- is this true throughout most

110
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,920
of the history of this civilization that we've

111
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,110
been studying now for this entire semester?

112
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,610
Yeah.

113
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,607
Is it true?

114
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,440
How many think that the government has owned

115
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,981
the land for most of Chinese history?

116
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,950


117
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,950
Mmm, you're not so sure.

118
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,890
There's definitely significant periods in Chinese history when it has.

119
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,520
Which ones might those be?

120
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,010
For example, in the Tang and Song dynasties.

121
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,903
In the Tang.

122
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:50,402
In the Tang.

123
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:51,794
In the Tang dynasty.

124
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,664
But the Song?

125
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,390
What kind of revolution did we talk about the Song having?

126
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,543
Among others?

127
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:58,042
Martin?

128
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:01,390
After the An Lushan rebellion, it was more like

129
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,890
that the people could buy land, and also sell land on a market.

130
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,290
In contrast to before, it was a double household system.

131
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,840
OK.

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,620
So if you're a farmer can you sell land in Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing times?

133
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,480


134
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,980
Yes?

135
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,920
Yes.

136
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,590
Yes.

137
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,410
The answer is, yes.

138
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,980
China has a much longer history of land-holding

139
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,960
being effectively freely alienable, that is you can buy it and sell it.

140
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,400
There are all kinds of historically distinct features

141
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,670
of Chinese land-holding, but it's a much freer economy

142
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,110
in land for the last 1,000 years of Chinese history

143
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,100
than is the case in Europe, serfdom in Eastern Europe,

144
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,810
large latifundia in southern Europe, large land-holdings

145
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,480
until the French Revolution in Western Europe, and in Britain as well.

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,590
It's really a kind of an 18th and 19th century revolution, and 20th century,

147
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,840
that changes land-holding patterns in Europe.

148
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,995
China has this a long time before, and it

149
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,430
is central to its growth as a great commercial economy.

150
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:19,540
And so with from Tang to 1949, land is not owned by the state.

151
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,982
