00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,300
Let's talk first about water.

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,240
In 2007, the World Bank reported that water problems

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,870
led to an estimated loss of over 2% of China's GDP.

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,380
China's per capita water resources are only 28%

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,540
of the global average, which is one of the lowest levels in the world.

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:39,840
The 20% of the world's population that lives in China survives on less than 7%

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,745
of global freshwater resources.

8
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:44,410


9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:50,360
And yet, China's expanding economy has meant an increasing demand for water.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,290
Scarcity of water has affected urban areas and agriculture.

11
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:01,480
2/3 of China's cities-- and there are 660 labelled as city's-- already lack

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,240
sufficient water resources to support further growth.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,110
Agriculture, meanwhile, accounts for about 2/3

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,520
of national water consumption, and half of China's water pollution

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,570
through fertilizer runoff and livestock waste.

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,890
China relies heavily on groundwater for its water.

17
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,120
It supplies 70% of the drinking waters in the dry Northeastern

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,970
and Northwestern parts of the country and over 40%

19
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,590
of the water used in farming.

20
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,320
But groundwater levels have dropped as quickly

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:43,020
as a meter per year between the years 1974 and 2000 in north China.

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,220
In urban areas, wells have been drilled into groundwater reserves

23
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,860
as deep as one kilometer.

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,760
Lakes have been shrinking over time.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,750
The total lake area of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces

26
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,500
decreased from about 30,000 square kilometers in 1949.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,350
It's hard to believe, but Hubei was once the province of 1,000 lakes.

28
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,710
It's total lake area having shrunk to about 3,000 square kilometers

29
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,810
from once 26,000 over the past century.

30
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,980
And only one of its 26 remaining lakes containing water

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,610
considered safe for human consumption.

32
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,280
China's largest freshwater lake-- Poyang Lake in Jiangxi province--

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,480
once covered an area of 3,500 square kilometers.

34
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,280
Today, only 200 square kilometers are underwater.

35
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,830
Rivers in China have been drying up.

36
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,190
China's first national census of water in 2013

37
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:54,980
reported that 28,000 rivers with catchment areas of 60 square miles

38
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,540
or more disappeared in the past 20 years alone.

39
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,980
In the United States, a loss of the equivalent amount of river basin area

40
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,170
would entail the disappearance of the entire Mississippi river.

41
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:15,110
Of the water resources that remain, the majority are now polluted.

42
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,890
In 2006, more than 70% of China's rivers and lakes were polluted.

43
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,930
In 2009, the Chinese Geological Survey showed that 90% of China's groundwater

44
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,690
was polluted-- 60% of it seriously so.

45
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,820
And in rural areas, the lack of clean piped water

46
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,350
was a leading cause of mortality among young children.

47
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,490


48
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:45,480
In 2012, it was estimated that more than 100 million Chinese still lacked access

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,210
to safe drinking water and another 200 million lacked access

50
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,720
to quality sanitation.

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,488
