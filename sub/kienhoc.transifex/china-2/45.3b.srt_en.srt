00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,834


3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:10,640
In your own scholarship, you have been really a leader

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,910
of integrating the study of history with political science

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,250
and looking at social and political movements

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,887
not just in contemporary times, but over the stretch from late Qing

7
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:23,845
through to the present.

8
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:27,470
And you've written a great deal about social movements

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,920
in China, from farming movements to urban movements.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,040
How do you see social movements today in China,

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,550
the large number of public demonstrations,

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,800
large number of gatherings on one or another issue very often local?

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,190
As a potential for instability, how do you

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,570
see this in the light of your very extraordinary historical research?

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,350
Well, a number of observers of China have been extremely surprised

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,350
by the extent of popular protest in contemporary China.

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,080
Many assumed that especially after the repression

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,630
of June 4, 1989, when the government with such brutal force

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,330
put down the student uprising, that we wouldn't

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,810
see much in the way of popular protest in China.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,330
And yet, if anything, popular protest seems

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,260
to have mushroomed since that period.

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,250
So that seems a little surprising.

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,810
And yet, in light of the longer sweep of Chinese history,

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,440
I think it's not terribly surprising.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,320
If we look at pretty much any day in the history of late Imperial or Republican

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,160
China, we can find plenty of documentary evidence

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,930
suggesting that there were protests all over the place.

29
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,500
And much like most of the protests today, they

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,200
were quite confined in space and quite limited in ambition.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,830
So I personally would not use the term "social movement"

32
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,470
to actually refer to them.

33
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,680
They are often referred to as social movements.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,480
But my understanding of a social movement, we

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,990
usually think of something that has a greater amount of coordination

36
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,190
and a greater unity of ambition and interests.

37
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,850
So we think of a civil rights social movement, to a women's liberation

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,460
social movement, to an environmental social movement,

39
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,540
in which large numbers of people in different places

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,360
share a certain ambition, a certain interest, a certain organization.

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,660
But what's distinctive, I think, about the popular protest in China today

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,060
is really how fragmented and dispersed it is.

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,650
And so even though many of those who are protesting

44
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,030
use the term "rights," for example that they have a right to survival

45
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,440
if they're protesting about welfare issues,

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,070
or they have a right to breathe clean air if they're

47
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,780
protesting about environmental issues, and so on, nevertheless, really,

48
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,800
their focus, their demands, their organization, their geographical reach,

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,600
often their social and educational composition

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,280
is really very, very different.

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,850
So we don't have something resembling, in America, 1960s civil rights movement

52
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,740
or 1970 women's liberation movement going on in China.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,750
We have a series of really very fragmented and uncoordinated

54
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,200
activities.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,970
These activities, I think, are very important.

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,390
I think they are regarded extremely seriously by the Chinese State, which

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,390
spends a lot of money and a lot of effort

58
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,490
trying to understand what's going on, trying to defuse them,

59
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,270
trying to ensure that they don't coalesce

60
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,070
into some unified kind of social movement, let

61
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,720
alone a political movement that would actually

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,290
challenge the authority of the party.

63
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,450
And to date, I think they've been very successful in that endeavor.

64
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,930
They have managed to squelch the movements that

65
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,190
threaten to become coordinated movements of one sort or another.

66
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,250
So many of us felt, for example, that in 1999, the Chinese State

67
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,230
used unnecessary force in repressing the Falun Gong movement.

68
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,290
But from the Chinese State's point of view,

69
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,640
the Falun Gong movement was particularly threatening, particularly dangerous,

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,010
because it had one clear leader Master Li Hongzhi, who

71
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,649
seemed to be calling the shots, who was located abroad,

72
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,950
who seemed to have foreign support.

73
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,460
The followers who gathered in 1999 in front of Zhongnanhai,

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,640
the leadership compound in Beijing, were from both urban and rural backgrounds,

75
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,940
men and women, educated, uneducated, military, party members, as well

76
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,500
as ordinary people, literate, unliterate, and so forth.

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,600
They had been organized through cellular technology,

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,510
through the use of cell phones.

79
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,500
So they were extremely frightening to the Chinese leadership,

80
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,470
whose approach to contentious politics is

81
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,970
to try to ensure that that kind of coordination and unification

82
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,460
does not take place.

83
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,610
Similarly, that same year a China Democratic Party

84
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,480
emerged in a number of different cities, where intellectuals and workers

85
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,520
had gathered together and tried to form something of a coordinated movement.

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,260
It too was quite brutally repressed.

87
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,700
On the other hand, movements that are much more limited in scope

88
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,110
are very important to the State as a source of information

89
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,150
about what grievances people care enough about in China.

90
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,450
So they're actually willing to take a bit of a risk and go out in the street

91
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,630
in order to make their case.

92
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,820
And we've seen, over the past couple of decades,

93
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,880
a number of ways in which the Chinese State has actually responded quite

94
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,440
flexibly to the challenges posed by these protests.

95
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,750
So in the 1990s, there were massive protests in the interior of China,

96
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,450
mostly by villagers, peasants, who were protesting

97
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,730
against the high level of taxes and miscellaneous fees.

98
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:10,410
And then China took the amazing step in 2005 to '06 of abolishing the two plus

99
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,600
millennia-old agricultural tax and so on.

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,300
So these kinds of protests, I think, provide very valuable information

101
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,940
in a political system where people can't go to the ballot box

102
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,830
and provide that information.

103
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:32,800
The State mines them very intelligently and often responds surprisingly

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,940
positively in trying to redress some of the grievances that

105
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,550
are expressed in them.

106
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:48,811
