1
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:11,860


2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,740
BILL KIRBY: We're now going to talk about a different kind of wealth,

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:21,450
and a wealth of a newly urbanizing area that was rural until very recently.

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,560
And we're going to talk about Kunshan.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,720
And we're going to use that as a vehicle to talk about, then, higher education.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,080
I think it's a little bit like Wanxiang.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,560
How many of you have heard of Kunshan before this class?

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,714
Michael, how had you heard of Kunshan?

9
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:39,130
MICHAEL: I live in North Carolina.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,100
BILL KIRBY: Oh, you live in North Carolina.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,740
MICHAEL: Yeah.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,365
BILL KIRBY: OK.

13
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:45,020
So because of Duke and their huge investment.

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,820
They just had their formal opening.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,340
That is, it's been open all fall.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,840
But the formal opening, where President Brodhead of Duke

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,330
went to Kunshan to formally open it, happened yesterday-- and very,

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,320
very successfully.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,120
Julia-- so Julia has lost her voice.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,530
So you want to do some hand signals?

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,330
How do we do her-- is it TV?

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,770
Bicycles.

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,810
Drums.

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,570
Kun Opera.

25
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,360
Oh, let's see.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,630
Let's not do Charades.

27
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,715
But yeah, write it down.

28
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:21,162
And we'll come back.

29
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:22,620
And Rose-Ann, you heard of Kunshan?

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,520
How had you heard of Kunshan?

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,710
ROSE-ANN: I'm interested in global health later on.

32
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,179
And so they have a master's program through DKU.

33
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:30,220
BILL KIRBY: Through Duke.

34
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,960
Again, through Duke.

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,834
So Duke is helping-- that's very interesting.

36
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:38,080
So Duke has perhaps the best Global Health program in the United States,

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,389
maybe in the world.

38
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,180
And that's one of the programs-- a master's

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,010
in Global Health at Duke Kunshan University.

40
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,720
Jonathan, how had you heard of Kunshan?

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,595
Because of Kun Opera?

42
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:48,860
JONATHAN: It's near Shanghai.

43
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,236
So it's a nearby city.

44
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:51,990
BILL KIRBY: Right.

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,470
OK.

46
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,130
Who else had heard of it?

47
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,840
Kevin, how had you heard of it?

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,170
KEVIN: My dad's gone a few times for business trips.

49
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,870
BILL KIRBY: Your dad goes for business.

50
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,940
Any of you ever had a giant bicycle as a kid?

51
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,428
Zheyan, you did?

52
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:07,700
ZHEYA: Yeah.

53
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,720
My whole family has, like, three giant bicycles.

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,972
BILL KIRBY: Three giant bicycles-- good for you.

55
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:17,050
Have any of you ever been to Kunshan?

56
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,890
Julia has been.

57
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,390
Yes.

58
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,806
OK, you went there for a vacation.

59
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,520


60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,770
In a boat-- on a cruise.

61
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,900
OK.

62
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,450
All right.

63
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,230
We get it.

64
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,150
We could really do this all morning and it would be maybe more fun.

65
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,280
But never the less.

66
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,000
OK.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,920
So now that we've heard of it, where is it, and what is it?

68
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,120
So Jake.

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,385
JAKE: It's in Jiangsu province, right between Shanghai and Suzhou.

70
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,010
BILL KIRBY: OK.

71
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,440
Between Shanghai and Suzhou.

72
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,541
Is that a good location?

73
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,040
JAKE: Yes.

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,650
BILL KIRBY: For what?

75
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,550
JAKE: For trade.

76
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:03,810
BILL KIRBY: For trade, indeed, to one historically famous city,

77
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,760
Suzhou-- and a very important center of wealth, and power,

78
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,870
and influence in imperial times.

79
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,110
Shanghai-- the modern international city.

80
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,579
So Kunshan is right between them.

81
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,620
Anything else that we need to know about Kunshan?

82
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,329
Jasmine?

83
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,120
JASMINE: It's also along the Yangtze River.

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,760
BILL KIRBY: So it's along-- it's south of the Yangtze River.

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,120
So it's in the Jiangnan area.

86
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,620
Mm hm.

87
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,320
JASMINE: It's a good place for foreign investment.

88
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,000
BILL KIRBY: So it's a good place today for foreign investment.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,680
Again, close to Shanghai, close to export markets.

90
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,716
Rose-Ann?

91
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:43,360
ROSE-ANN: Also, because of its location as being Shanghai and Suzhou,

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,684
a lot of, like, the tech-- because those two cities are very highly invested in.

93
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:50,100
And so a lot of the advanced tech.

94
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,655
Or again, just the latest stuff that they can get automatically.

95
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:55,655
Not automatically, but--

96
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:56,280
BILL KIRBY: OK.

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,370
So these are comparatively developed places compared to Kunshan,

98
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,340
at least in economic terms, when this case begins, at least.

99
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,410
So we've got its physical location.

100
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,765
As an urban area, what kind of urban area is it formally?

101
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:14,070
Do you remember?

102
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,950
It's a bizarre name.

103
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,413
Halah, do you remember?

104
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:17,240
HALAH: County city?

105
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,531
BILL KIRBY: It's a county city.

106
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:19,560
That's right.

107
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
It is actually, kind of.

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,210
It's a county-level city.

109
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,040
OK.

110
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,580
Which means that it isn't quite a city.

111
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,200
It Isn't quite like a special metropolis.

112
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:39,360
But it's a county-level city in Jiangsu province.

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,970
OK.

114
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,010
All right.

115
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,010
What does this tell us about it, Xiao Xiao?

116
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,530
XIAO XIAO: One interesting thing about this county city

117
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,530
is that it's a self-developed ETDZ zone, which

118
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,810
stands for Economic and Technological Development Zone.

119
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,600
BILL KIRBY: OK.

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,370
So it is home to what is called an Economic Technological Development

121
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,870
Zone.

122
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,990
But as a county-level city, is it within or associated with any other city?

123
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,550
Pragya?

124
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,034
PRAGYA: It's close to Shanghai and Suzhou.

125
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:18,950
BILL KIRBY: It's close to Shanghai and Suzhou,

126
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,310
but that's a matter of geography.

127
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,050
How close to Shanghai and Suzhou is it?

128
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,322
PRAGYA: I think, like, 30, 40 miles.

129
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:26,030
BILL KIRBY: Yeah.

130
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,230
But it borders them.

131
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,780
It's bordered by them.

132
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,360
Eric?

133
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,090
ERIC: It's administered by Suzhou's prefecture.

134
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,400
BILL KIRBY: So it's within the prefecture.

135
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,250
So Suzhou is a city.

136
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,990
But Suzhou is also a prefecture, and it's within the prefecture of Suzhou.

137
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:49,680
So it's in prefecture of Suzhou.

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,160
And it's next, also, to Shanghai.

139
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,830


140
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,045
All right.

141
00:05:58,045 --> 00:05:59,860
We're getting somewhere.

142
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,890
What is Kunshan famous for, historically?

143
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:09,238
