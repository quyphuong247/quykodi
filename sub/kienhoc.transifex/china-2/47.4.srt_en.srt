[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:09,200


3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,440
What is Mr. Lu's fundamental strategy?

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,510
Focusing on human capital.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,310
So big investment from a startup nothing,

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,990
smelting your own metal, as it were, or blacksmithing,

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,625
to big-- for the industry-- big R&D investment.

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,315


9
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:29,815
What else?

10
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:33,130


11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,630
Yeah?

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,213
Please, do it.

13
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:36,680
I was really shocked by the fact that, initially, they

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,950
weren't allocated by-- they weren't allocated

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,770
quota for university students.

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,489
So he actually offered to pay $6,000 for each university graduate.

17
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:48,245
So in a way, he was sort of working outside the system.

18
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:48,745
Right.

19
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:50,240
So the system is totally allocated.

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,781
You graduate.

21
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,290
You're told where to work.

22
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:52,790
Right.

23
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,280
He doesn't get any good workers coming out of universities, so he buys them.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,530
This should happen to all of you guys, just be bought.

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,330
[LAUGHTER]

26
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,210
You are people.

27
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,300
Well, why would not.

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,906
But anyway, Julia, go ahead.

29
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:04,197
So I thought that was extremely creative--

30
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:04,697
Right.

31
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,545
--given that China, at the time-- and we keep

32
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:12,149
talking about how China's ruled by men, and not by rule.

33
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:14,965
But in a way, you know, China needs people

34
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,616
like that to keep pushing the envelope up

35
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:20,101
because, eventually, you need men to create the rules.

36
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,592
So I feel like he is one of those--

37
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:23,083
Or women.

38
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:30,041
--that actually push the envelope of the current system and write the new rules.

39
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:30,590
Yeah.

40
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,030
OK.

41
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,030
That's absolutely right.

42
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,944
Victoria?

43
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:35,260
Just a question on that.

44
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,205
I keep reading about then you make a payment to someone,

45
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:44,790
and in return, got rights to do something revolutionary, like actually

46
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,690
reward performance for workers, revolutionary at the time.

47
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,680
So my question is, is there a rule against that?

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,300
Is it against-- for example, I'm paying you that much money --

49
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,540
You mean the university graduate?

50
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,300
No, not just anyone about to graduate, but also there's this guarantee.

51
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,380
Basically, he's paying to the Ningwei village government,

52
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,600
he's paying a fixed annual payment at an incredible growth rate of 20% per year,

53
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,782
and in return, gets the right to actually-- management right?

54
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:18,282
Right.

55
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:24,250
And that's how he can then create the system of performance-based salaries?

56
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,750
Right.

57
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,500
So he wants to be able to reward his own workers in a way

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,661
that the socialist system does not allow.

59
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:30,161
Exactly.

60
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:33,107
But the question is does it not allow at all that this is happening?

61
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:36,023
These payments that are being made, I'm trying to put a label on them.

62
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,580
And I'm hesitating to call them bribes.

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,110
Right.

64
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,610
Right.

65
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,911
So how do I call them?

66
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,402
Payments in rural province --

67
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:44,887
[LAUGHTER]

68
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:45,769
David?

69
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,352
I mean, it doesn't sound like a bribe.

70
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:50,526
It sounds more like an explicit contractual arrangement

71
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:53,145
with the government that he has.

72
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:55,242
So he leases the factory from the government.

73
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,950
But that's the question behind it.

74
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,170
So it is a payment to, basically, go around something

75
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,120
that counts for everyone else.

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,585
To me, that sounds like.

77
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,480
Let's see.

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,440
Jinfeng, do you have a way of describing this?

79
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,080
Yes.

80
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,552
The thing here is there is no rule against this,

81
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:15,032
so there's no rule forbidding you to do this.

82
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:19,992
But in order to keep the government's eyes like this-- just

83
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:25,282
to keep them closed, or something-- in order to negotiate, to just set up

84
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:27,432
some starter rules, or something-- because there

85
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:33,880
was no formal examples for them to learn from whereas 20%, 30%, 40%, even 50%.

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,368
So there was no extended rule.

87
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:37,352
But still negotiate this.

88
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:41,816
And then, as long as the government's hukou-- especially,

89
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:44,792
that everything's an experiment.

90
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,270
So it's not -- it's just-- you know?

91
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,181
It's a sense of navigational skill.

92
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:50,680
Yeah.

93
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:50,855
Yeah.

94
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,390
Right?

95
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,020
So there are times in which things that are not explicitly legal

96
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,500
can be forbidden, post facto.

97
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,920
So you'll have to know the waters in which you are navigating.

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,330
But this is not a big place in any way, right?

99
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,601
We don't have the population statistics, I don't think, anywhere.

100
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,560
It's a small place.

101
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,380
This is Mr. Lu and the party secretary having a cigarette together.

102
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,311


103
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,560
You know, it would all depend on who these people are.

104
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,270
The party secretary wants this place to not starve,

105
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,130
wants it to prosper, presumably.

106
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,974
This guy is helping people to do it.

107
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,640
How do you do it, somehow or other, within the socialist system,

108
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,330
and not being called a capitalist roader, or something,

109
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,929
in the late '60s or early '70s?

110
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,470
Maybe this contractual arrangement allows him to, as it were,

111
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,070
pay taxes or pay payment in lieu of something or other,

112
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,450
and make his workers more motivated than they would be if everybody is just

113
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,730
paid by work points, which is the Cultural Revolution for.

114
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,210
But if there isn't a sympathetic party secretary,

115
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,860
we probably don't have this case, I think.

116
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,960
And indeed, there's one of these booklets

117
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,800
that is devoted to the memory of the, now deceased, party secretary.

118
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,820
So the party matters critically in this.

119
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,330
What else would one say about this?

120
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,970
What's his growth model?

121
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,280
How fast does he want to grow?

122
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,380
Michael, do you remember?

123
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,169
Well, he wants to grow fast.

124
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,620
But in terms of expanding abroad, he wants to have it localized.

125
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,043
So when he expanded to the US, he had, I think, 2,000 American workers,

126
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:34,020
but only 59 --

127
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,460
But what's his growth target, Zack?

128
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
Like a target?

129
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,190
Like a number?

130
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,815
Yeah, a number.

131
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:40,930
How much does he want to grow?

132
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,720
It's pretty stunning for a company to have this ambition and to meet it.

133
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,030
Wasn't it tenfold or something?

134
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,770
10 times every decade.

135
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,644
Yes.

136
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:54,170
10 times every decade.

137
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,356
And what about culture?

138
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,605
There are a lot of quotations.

139
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,340


140
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,800
There's even a book here.

141
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,230
You know, Chairman Mao has his a little red book.

142
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,120
This is Chairman Lu's little blue book.

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,170
Wanxiang wenhua, Wanxiang culture.

144
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,130
And you can learn.

145
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,985
You guys, study this book, and you'll be better people.

146
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:17,610
I guarantee it.

147
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,820
But you will definitely be a little bit better managers, if you ever were to--

148
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,500
Think of some of the quotations.

149
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,310
What kind of people should you hire, according to Mr. Lu?

150
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,380
"Confidently employ those with strong talents and ethics.

151
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:41,430
Those with strong ethics and no talents should be entrusted with less.

152
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,014
"Do not employ talented individuals without morals."

153
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:49,430
Anyway, there are many things that seem like common sense,

154
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,920
but actually they're written with great power and interest

155
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,066
in the Wanxiang wenhua in this.

156
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,870
And so it has a strong and cohesive corporate culture

157
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,190
built around the personality of the founder.

158
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,780
Anything else about Mr. Lu?

159
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,960
Yeah, Jinfeng?

160
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,760
Very low profile, especially during this debating.

161
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,010
And also, there is a lot of different contributions --

162
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,880


163
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,380
Right.

164
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,350
He keeps a low profile at this point.

165
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,850
Yes.

166
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,560
He doesn't advertise himself as China's first new entrepreneur in the Cultural

167
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,170
Revolution.

168
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,250
I don't know why he didn't take that opportunity, but he didn't.

169
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,500
And then something like first generation entrepreneurs

170
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,400
at the same time as Mr. Lu.

171
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,360
And that most of them went to jail.

172
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,804
So he is probably the only one that's being

173
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:40,490
kept, like managing the company during that period.

174
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,830
So he's still in charge.

175
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,410
That's absolutely right.

176
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,610
Lots of TVEs in the '80s.

177
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,540
Very few of them are around today.

178
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,770
A lot of them destroyed by state-owned enterprises.

179
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,580
A lot of them just fizzled out.

180
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,080
Nuzzi?

181
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,579
Yeah.

182
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,430
I think there's definitely something to be said about how resilient

183
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,345
and how he never gives up.

184
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:02,780
He's working for a state-owned enterprise.

185
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,673
He gets laid off.

186
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:05,510
Finds himself jobless.

187
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,947
He tries to start up a food processing plant.

188
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,780
The government doesn't grant him the access,

189
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,220
so he starts trying to find a way until '73.

190
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,140
He strikes something that actually works.

191
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,740
And now--

192
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,520
And miraculously, it's not illegal.

193
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,020
Yeah.

194
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,769
It may not be legal, but it's not illegal.

195
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,989
And I think there's something to be said about that, because the rule of law,

196
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,030
basically, doesn't exist.

197
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,729
You have a switch in the political setting in the country.

198
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,980
So he's, in a way, trying to help develop the economy.

199
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,500
And with that, he is bringing the government together.

200
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,150
You can have a more cynic view and go question is it a bribe.

201
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:51,895
But the way I see it, this could be seen as a concession for doing business.

202
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:55,360
You know, if you meet him, and if you ever go to Hangzhou

203
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,080
and have the opportunity to do so, I strongly recommend it.

204
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,400
You know you're in the presence of a world-class entrepreneur.

205
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,070
You're also in the presence of somebody who is absolutely indomitable,

206
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,730
just would not give up.

207
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,580
This guy was born to be-- just to get back

208
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,729
to this-- born to be a businessman, born to be an entrepreneur,

209
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:15,270
just happened to be born at the worst time in Chinese history

210
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,410
to be an entrepreneur, until a little bit later.

211
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,260
Patrick?

212
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,860
As you're saying, in addition to being this incredibly resourceful

213
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,206
and resilient, I think he has just an outrageous ambition

214
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,820
to be a global player.

215
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,100
And I think it's great.

216
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,240
My favorite part, I think, of the case is

217
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,020
when they say that, after he's doing work with Zeller,

218
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,580
he establishes his "going out" philosophy where

219
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,630
he wants to, by earning foreigner's money, using foreigner's resources,

220
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,160
being foreigner's bosses in a foreigner's land.

221
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
So I think he has ambitions outside --

222
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,505
Does this worry you?

223
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,940
No, I think it's great.

224
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,480
I think it's great.

225
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,520
To some degree, it does come at the expense, potentially,

226
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,930
of those foreigners, obviously.

227
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,341
But--

228
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:00,841
Hm.

229
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:01,674
This is interesting.

230
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:07,020
He's providing low-cost parts at American prices.

231
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,922
And he's saving American businesses.

232
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:12,820
And more power to him.

233
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,660
So now, what is Wanxiang America?

234
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:21,040
Now we get into the international -- What are they doing?

235
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,747
