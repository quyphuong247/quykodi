00:00:05,247 --> 00:00:09,540


3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,470
BILL KIRBY: If we look outside here-- I will get to it-- of every 20 cars,

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,360
you won't find one hybrid.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,380
You won't find one diesel.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,020
You won't find one electric car in a city that is comparatively flat.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,810
Same could be said for Beijing.

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,160
Places that seemed to be built for alternative forms.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,220
Is this because of automobile industry as an interest group, or because

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,110
of the petroleum industry, or other?

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,900
Why is, it seems to an outsider, China compared to Europe,

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,796
been slow to adopt to more energy efficient forms of transportation,

13
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,920
particularly in an industry that's growing so fast?

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,910
CHRIS P. NIELSEN: In fact, China has had incredibly aggressive fuel efficiency

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,850
standards in its vehicle industry.

16
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,390
It had higher fuel efficiency standards than the United States.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,600
The US has recently enacted new standards, but until a few years ago,

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,230
China was actually ahead of the US in terms of new cars

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,870
that required fuel efficiency.

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,190
You have a developing country.

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,345
You have an urbanizing country.

22
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:15,350
It is designed around the car, just like in Western urban development, which

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,150
is maybe not the smartest thing to do.

24
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,240
But it's a typical thing to do, and so you

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,410
have incredible growth in the vehicle population,

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,780
like 15% to 20% percent a year.

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,610
That's astonishing compared to Western countries.

28
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,760
Your point about there not being very many electric cars or hybrid

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,510
is a good point, and it's a little bit surprising

30
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,900
that the penetration of electric and hybrid cars

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,750
is as slow as it has been in China to date.

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,720
But the government is actually trying to put in incentives to change that.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,900
And as you know, there are electric car manufacturers in China.

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,490
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: Looking forward to the potential for hybrid vehicles,

35
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,350
I don't think that natural gas actually is a potential solution

36
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,340
to the transportation issue in China.

37
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,150
China doesn't have a lot of natural gas.

38
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,260
It depends on imports, on their increase.

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,840
That, I think, is the way forward.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,664
In terms of the traffic problems and the air quality problems,

41
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:16,830
part of the issue here in major Chinese cities, at least as I understand it,

42
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,710
is congestion, the fact that you have increasing number of cars on the road.

43
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,000
Increasingly they're stationary, trying to get through the next blockade.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,610
BILL KIRBY: I've been there.

45
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,526
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: And if they're stationary,

46
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:30,950
they're also pumping pollution into the environment.

47
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,850
So part of the contribution to the air quality issue

48
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:40,180
is coming from cars that are simply not moving but wasting energy.

49
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,730
So if you had, for example, the simple technologies available in a Toyota

50
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,620
Prius, for example, where you simply-- the car stops

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,760
functioning when it's stationary.

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,069
That would be a step forward.

53
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,110
But we have to go even more aggressively forward.

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,470
The Chinese government made a decision to try

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,980
to improve the efficiency of coal-fired electricity generation, particularly

56
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,700
in northern China, by investing in what's

57
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,100
called combined heat and power systems.

58
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,110
Namely, you need hot water to heat houses in winter,

59
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,370
so you actually get the hot water at the same time

60
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,680
that you're producing the electricity from coal.

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,120
But in the same region, they have invested an enormous amount

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,770
of resources in wind turbines.

63
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,440
So China now has the world's largest array of wind turbines,

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,882
more than the United States, but it produces less electricity from wind

65
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:32,590
than the US does.

66
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,090
BILL KIRBY: Right.

67
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,060
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: In winter in this particular region, because you

68
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,605
have to have the hot water in order to heat the houses,

69
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:41,480
you have to keep running the coal-fired power

70
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,790
plants, which means that you don't need the electricity from the wind farm.

71
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,920
China has significant wind resources.

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
China has the opportunity to develop those wind resources

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,470
and with the infrastructure that you need to actually use it.

74
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,060
What that means is that you have to be able to transmit

75
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,950
the electricity from where you produce it to where you need it.

76
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,000
But since the Chinese energy economy is still in a growth phase,

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,490
you can actually efficiently imagine doing that.

78
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,495
You can build wind farms offshore and bring the power

79
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:17,630
on shore to where the big demand is rather than mining coal in the north,

80
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,439
shipping it by rail to the coast, and bringing it down to Shanghai.

81
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,590
I mean, there are better ways to do things.

82
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,420
Wind is a real possibility to move forward.

83
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,670
Now, the Chinese government has also made a commitment

84
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,307
to building its nuclear industry in a major way.

85
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:32,890
I don't frankly think that that's going to solve the problems,

86
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,389
and I don't think it's a cost-effective way to move forward.

87
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,230
But they're going to do a little bit of everything in order to do it.

88
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,630
The major bet that the government is making

89
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,080
for the future of renewable energy is in hydro.

90
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,520
And I've been working on a book on Chinese energy recently

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,920
and just finished writing a chapter on hydro.

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,380
One of the astonishing things about hydro in China

93
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,210
is that the plan is to develop hydro to the point

94
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,990
where it makes a major contribution to the goal of reducing the carbon

95
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,020
content of Chinese energy economy about 15% by 2020.

96
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,430
That's a hell of a big plan to do.

97
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,810
We want to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by 15% relative to the total.

98
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,370
Hydro is regarded as an important way forward.

99
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,140
But when you start looking at it, where is the hydro coming from?

100
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,680
Almost all of that hydro is being produced

101
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,545
by precipitation in the Tibetan Plateau in a relatively small region

102
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:37,530
of the Tibetan Plateau, which is feeding the major east west Chinese rivers,

103
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,070
and also feeding the major north south rivers.

104
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,470
So the Brahmaputra and the Mekong.

105
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,600
And Chinese plans are to dam the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Jiangsu,

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,580
to dam essentially all these three major rivers going to the south,

107
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,750
and to increase the production of electricity from that.

108
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:06,300
But in 2011, China in that particular region of Tibet had a major drought.

109
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,650
It was a 50 year drought.

110
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,570
The flow of water--

111
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,810
BILL KIRBY: And it's the worst drought in 50 years.

112
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,018
MICHAEL B. MCELROY: 50 years.

113
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:14,490
The flow of water in the Yangtze decreased to the point

114
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,330
where electricity generation from the Three Gorges

115
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,880
decreased very significantly.

116
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,780
So if you start thinking about the future,

117
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,020
it's going to depend to a significant extent on what kind of a climate

118
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,680
there is, and can you predict what's going to be?

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,340
So if a climate turns out to be in that source region of that water

120
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,750
but it turns out to be very dry, you've made an enormous investment

121
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,150
in a resource that's not going to pay off.

122
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,610
So that's another part of the challenge that China faces.

123
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,235
