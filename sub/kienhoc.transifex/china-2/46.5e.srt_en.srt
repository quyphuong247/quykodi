paddy field being prepared for planting, soil being turned over, not

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,833
by individual families, not by whole villagers,

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:34,420
but by three machines in this mechanized agriculture

00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,600
that is the dominant theme of this enormous agricultural park.

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,330
There are 2,000 such fields in this enormous and soon-to-be

00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,350
productive experiment.
