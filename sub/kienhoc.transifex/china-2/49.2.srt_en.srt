1
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:10,610
Student: They also have some famous thinkers.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,469
I think they had a mathematician who calculated pi to the seventh digit.

3
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:15,510
BILL KIRBY: That's right.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,930
Mr. Zu Chongzhi calculated pi, the first person.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,460
So giving misery to generations of people studying mathematics

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,410
after him, OK?

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,190
That's one contribution.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,590
But other scholars, that's right, it's known as a scholarly place.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,470
Any names, remember?

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,377
Derek?

11
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,460
DEREK: It's like generally a cultural center where

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:42,942
a lot of philosophers and also the Kun Opera was based there.

13
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,300
BILL KIRBY: OK.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,260
So one name is Mr. Gu Yanwu.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,650
Has anybody here heard of Gu Yanwu before?

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,830
JONNY: He was a writer that refused to submit to the Qing dynasty.

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,340
He was in the Ming era.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,360
But I'm guessing he's from Kunshan.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,610
BILL KIRBY: You guessed right.

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,370
There's a big statue of him in Kunshan.

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,090
Peter, what do we know about Gu Yanwu?

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,860
PETER: Well, he was one of the most famous scholars of the 17th century.

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,330
He was one of three or four people that is seen in retrospect as having shifted

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,760
the nature of learning away from neo-Confucianism

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,550
towards empirical and evidential ways of gaining knowledge.

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,600
And he has numerous writings and is seen today, still,

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,557
as one of the great thinkers of the time.

28
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:36,140
BILL KIRBY: So it's possible, at least according to this case,

29
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,080
but also if you go to the Kunshan Museum,

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,000
there are the great thinkers of the 17th century.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,930
And I think in part because this region was with leading scholars, many of them

32
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,000
loyal to the Ming, it didn't fare well in the early part of the Qing.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,160
And indeed, in terms of really matters of great distinction,

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,520
at least according to this case, nothing happens between the 17th century

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,760
and the latter part of the 20th century in Kunshan.

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,340
JAKE DORABIALSKI: Just wanted to comment.

37
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,646
It's the area where there's a lot of entrepreneurial spirit,

38
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:10,479
I guess you can say.

39
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,330
Because in the last case, we talked about the Wanxiang group.

40
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,110
And that's-- it's right in that region.

41
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,770
I'd say there's a buzz, entrepreneurial spirit there.

42
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,220
BILL KIRBY: It's an interesting question.

43
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,650
So we have, with the case of Mr. Lu, who from the bottom up in Hangzhou

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,750
becomes this great entrepreneur.

45
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,584
Can you name a famous Kunshan entrepreneur?

46
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:37,570
Hannah?

47
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,534
HANNAH: Wang An?

48
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,950
BILL KIRBY: An Wang, as he would be known in this country,

49
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,137
he was an engineer from Kunshan trained through the government,

50
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,220
the national government, sent to the United States

51
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,370
to study abroad during the war, founded Wang Computers.

52
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,000
Your parents and grandparents now will remember Wang Computers.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,270
Wang Processors, it was a hugely successful company

54
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,470
here in Massachusetts, set up their headquarters in Lowell, Massachusetts.

55
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,910
And sometime in the mid 19th, it was the first word processor,

56
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,630
the first computerized word processor, going from the typewriter

57
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,570
to a standalone word processor.

58
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,670
And the one thing that Mr. Wang was absolutely convinced

59
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,530
was that the word processor would be around forever.

60
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,080
But the personal computer had no future.

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,430
This was wrong, as it turns out.

62
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,890
And Wang Computers is now dead as a doornail.

63
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,510
If you go to Lowell, their headquarters are still basically uninhabited.

64
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,610
When Wang was doing well, one of our predecessors, John Fairbank,

65
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,620
got Mr. An Wang to give our Fairbank Center two or three

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,130
postdoctoral fellowships in Chinese Studies, which we now still to this day

67
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,500
call An Wang Fellows.

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,220
So he lives on in spirit, in scholarship.

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,259
Who's the leading entrepreneurs in this case?

70
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,050
It's a really good question, Jake, to think

71
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,150
of where entrepreneurship comes from and what this case is about.

72
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,055
Who would you say is the leading protagonist here, Katherine?

73
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:14,360
KATHERINE: Guan Aiguo.

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,810
BILL KIRBY: Guan Aiguo.

75
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,320
OK.

76
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,769
Who is Guan Aiguo?

77
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,310
KATHERINE: He's the head of the town, Kunshan, the party leader.

78
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,950
BILL KIRBY: He's the party secretary of the town of Kunshan,

79
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,900
which is basically outranking the mayor.

80
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,940
He's the party secretary, Chinese Communist Party

81
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,720
secretary of the town of Kunshan.

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,045
And he is-- how would you think of him as an entrepreneur?

83
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:45,890


84
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,120
KATHERINE: He supported the idea of investing heavily of their own money

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,772
into development.

86
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:53,110
BILL KIRBY: Whose money?

87
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,850
His money?

88
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,310
He and his brothers?

89
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,594
His mother and his father, kind of family business?

90
00:04:57,594 --> 00:04:58,760
KATHERINE: The town's money.

91
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,149
BILL KIRBY: The town's money, right.

92
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:05,520
KATHERINE: And developing this where they had government support.

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,460
BILL KIRBY: OK.

94
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,133
Henry?

95
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,557
HENRY: The thing that's also striking about him

96
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:16,250
with Communist officials in Kunshan, they would come here.

97
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,090
They would engineer this marvelous economic growth

98
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,745
and they would be promoted onwards.

99
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:23,420
But this man has remained here for quite a while.

100
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,270
And I think that's indicative not only of his loyalty to this place,

101
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,442
but also of his personal investment in Kunshan, as well.

102
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:30,150
BILL KIRBY: Yeah.

103
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,850
And I don't think we know all the reasons of this.

104
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,280
It would be very natural for somebody of his accomplishments

105
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,350
to have been promoted to a provincial-- and this may yet

106
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,260
happen, as far as having met him a few times,

107
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,690
there are several things that strike me.

108
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,410
He is an entrepreneur in some sense, like Lu Guanqiu.

109
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:56,870
He knows the bottom line, the profit and loss statements

110
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,570
of every private company, major private company, in Kunshan.

111
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,290
And he cares about them.

112
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,180
He's the party secretary, but he knows business, and he knows it really well.

113
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,120
It's a cosmopolitan in his tastes and in his interests.

114
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,940
So what does the case call him?

115
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,290
So there's a word in the case.

116
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:16,790
Eric?

117
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,164
ERIC: Entrepreneurial bureaucrat.

118
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:20,790
BILL KIRBY: An entrepreneurial bureaucrat.

119
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,147
Now, is that a good thing?

120
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:23,345
ERIC: Yeah.

121
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:24,970
BILL KIRBY: We think it's a good thing.

122
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,310
ERIC: The way I see him, he's like an entrepreneurial guy.

123
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,380
He's a visionary, believes in the markets

124
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,050
throughout this decade, two decades.

125
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,440
He dedicates himself to this vision that he has and makes it happen.

126
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,814
And he takes innovative solutions in the process.

127
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:48,105
But at the same time, he's still a government official,

128
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:51,050
and he makes the most of that, so --

129
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,355
BILL KIRBY: What's the difference then between an entrepreneurial bureaucrat

130
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:58,230
and a bureaucratic capitalist, if you know that term?

131
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,750
Which you may or may not have come across somewhere.

132
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,770
Henry, what's a bureaucratic capitalist?

133
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,705
Somebody called you a bureaucratic capitalist, would you be pleased?

134
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:10,200
AUDIENCE: Probably not.

135
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,470
BILL KIRBY: It's not something that's in the case of something

136
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,386
you could either know.

137
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:19,060
In Chinese, it's Guanliao Ziben, bureaucratic capitalism.

138
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,190
And there's a lot of it in China today.

139
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,590
There's a lot of it.

140
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,840
What is that, and how would you distinguish it

141
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,030
from what this guy appears to be doing?

142
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,170
It's a complicated thing.

143
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:37,720
But you just happen to be-- let's see, who would this be?

144
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,980
Robert, you're the minister of railroads.

145
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,345
And you also happen to have some interest in a steel mill.

146
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:51,270
Or maybe some members of your family have interest in a steel mill

147
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,740
that provides steel for the high speed rails that are being built.

148
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,320
And maybe another family member is associated

149
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,350
with one of the construction firms that is building the elevated rail

150
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,670
system between Beijing and Shanghai.

151
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,860
And maybe another close friend or family member

152
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:18,510
or classmate with who you're closely associated and gives you periodic gifts

153
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,440
has the concessions on the railroad.

154
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,770
And maybe you get really, unbelievably rich.

155
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,620
Something like this happened to the last minister of railroads.

156
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,169
At least, it's what he's accused of.

157
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,150
That's kind of bureaucratic capitalism.

158
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,919
You're in charge of a ministry, or of an enterprise, or something.

159
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,119
But you also have a huge personal financial stake in it.

160
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:48,990
In this case, there's no evidence of this in the case of Guan Aiguo.

161
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,590
This guy is like a guy who's trying to bring business to a local state

162
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,060
or municipality here in the United States.

163
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,060
PETER: Do you think there's a connection between this history of places

164
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,140
as a place of scholarship and the decision to try to work with Duke?

165
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,640
BILL KIRBY: That's a great question.

166
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,260
PETER: No, I'm serious.

167
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,090
What do you think?

168
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,600
BILL KIRBY: Without question, the party secretary, Guan Aiguo,

169
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,220
who's really been an extraordinary mover of Kunshan's development,

170
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:26,180
but also in bringing Duke to Kunshan certainly talks about it in this.

171
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,550
It's also, I think, part of other developmental--

172
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,012
and we could talk about it.

173
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:34,220
Let's get back to that point.

174
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:41,620
Because I think if you go and visit the History of Kunshan Exhibit

175
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,670
right down across from City Hall in Kunshan,

176
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,230
you will see mentions of the great scholars of the past, without question.

177
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,750
But not for long.

178
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,710
Then, you move very quickly into Kunshan as a modern economic development

179
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,480
zone, for which universities are important.

180
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,820
But it's an excellent-- it is, without question, part of their heritage.

181
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,595
Kat?

182
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:08,360
Do you think Professor Bol is right?

183
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,230
KAT: Well, I was going to say it's also famous for hairy crabs.

184
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,560
BILL KIRBY: It's very famous for hairy crabs.

185
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,390
OK, so this is really important.

186
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,300
Do we know if this craze of hairy crabs, the most difficult food

187
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,100
to eat on Earth for a foreigner-- Chinese, you're born with the talent

188
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,184
to eat these things.

189
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:28,100
But they're delicious.

190
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,640
They're absolutely delicious.

191
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,090
Expensive.

192
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,550
And they've been grown in this lake in Kunshan for centuries.

193
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,580
But I don't know, and Peter, do you know Is

194
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,490
there a long history of hairy crabs on Qing menus, Ming menus?

195
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,824
PETER: Not that I know of, Bill.

196
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:45,739
BILL KIRBY: All right.

197
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:46,900
PETER: But I don't know.

198
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,687
Is this a modern fad or not?

199
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:50,770
BILL KIRBY: We don't know.

200
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,855
Anyone who can answer this question gets an extra point.

201
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:59,760
So center of scholarship historically.

202
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,360


203
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,780
Center of hairy crabs.

204
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,440
Sachin?

205
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,300
SACHIN: It was also a center for culture, so their Operas--

206
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,280
BILL KIRBY: So Kun Opera, also.

207
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,574
Kun Opera, I was going to say, so center of scholarship and of culture,

208
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:17,115
historically.

209
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:20,610


210
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,230
Kun Opera.

211
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,450


212
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,920
Anybody here heard Kun Opera?

213
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,590
So Professor Bol, you like Kun Opera?

214
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,880
PETER: Sure.

215
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,350
It's the great southern style.

216
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,100
BILL KIRBY: It's the great southern style.

217
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,490
I have to tell you, me personally, I hate Peking Opera.

218
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,850
Just it gives me a migraine every time.

219
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm just-- bang, bang, bang!

220
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,070
Kun Opera is more delicate, more interesting, more engaging stories,

221
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,354
and it doesn't go on so long.

222
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:51,520
PETER: Lots of love stories.

223
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,480
BILL KIRBY: Lots of love stories.

224
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,460
It can go very long, but it's really quite wonderful,

225
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,730
constantly being reinvented, and still today in Kunshan.

226
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,000
So it is a place of great classical background.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,010
What is its agricultural basis before 20, 30 years ago?

228
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,180
Kenny?

229
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,750
KENNY: Probably cloth and silk.

230
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,520
BILL KIRBY: Silk, silk for sure.

231
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,020
So when I first took the train from Nanjing to Shanghai,

232
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,564
it was nothing-- you could see nothing but farms.

233
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:24,730
And it would have gone through part of Kunshan, what

234
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,170
is now this larger town of Kunshan, and then now city.

235
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,990
But there were mulberry trees everywhere along the way

236
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,530
because this was one of the centers of Chinese sericulture.

237
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:42,080
And today, every time I take that same train, which now takes about a third

238
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,380
of the amount of time, I can't find a single mulberry tree.

239
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,840
And in Kunshan, I can't.

240
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,970
There must be some.

241
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,640
But there aren't a lot.

242
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,210
So it has a distinguished agricultural and cultural history.

243
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,750
So now, think of its modern development history.

244
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,040
What distinguishes this place?

245
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,810
Why write a case, apart from the Duke operation, which

246
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,630
is extremely important, but why write a case about Kunshan?

247
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,491
