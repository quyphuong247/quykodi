1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,240
As Taiwan's economy improved in the 1970s and '80s,

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,170
Taiwan's middle class grew.

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,360
Increasing numbers of Taiwanese demanded the political voice

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,150
that they had been denied under Nationalist rule.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,390
In the face of these demands, President Jiang Jingguo,

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,057
the son of Chiang Kai-shek, finally ended martial law in 1987,

7
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:35,765
just when the People's Republic had begun

8
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:38,760
to emulate Taiwan's model of export-led growth,

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,540
a new model of a democratic Taiwan emerged.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,110
We must remember that martial law was brutal at times.

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,760
There was not a small white terror against potential enemies

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,690
of the regime in the 1950s.

13
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,940
Those who sought truly free and fair elections in the 1970s

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,270
would be intimidated and imprisoned.

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,680
I recall the story of a friend of mine, Professor Tom Gold, who

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,980
teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, who is researching

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,180
what has become the most famous book on the Taiwan miracle,

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,100
State and Society in the Taiwan Miracle.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,250
And I remember Professor Gold telling the story of once writing home

20
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,970
to his mother, saying how difficult it was

21
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,330
for him to learn Taiwanese, the dialect, on top of Chinese.

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,890
Because you had to know Taiwanese to talk to entrepreneurs,

23
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,280
but you also needed to know Mandarin.

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,990
He wrote this letter home.

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,240
And the next day a postman came-- a postman with very good English

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,320
came-- knocked on his door, and returned the letter in a plastic bag.

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,840
He said the postman apologized that the letter had been damaged,

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,440
and he wanted to return it to Professor Gold, then a graduate student.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,130


30
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,410
And the postman asked Tom Gold, by the way,

31
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,060
what did you mean by this phrase, Taiwanese, on top of Chinese?

32
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,440
The lifting of martial law in 1987 and the introduction

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,290
of constitutional reforms, including the direct election of the President,

34
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,670
set the stage for a new era of tension between Taiwan and the PRC.

35
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,080
During Taiwan's martial law era, the Nationalists and the Communists

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,400
claimed to share the same vision-- that there was one China.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,380
They just disagreed as to which was the legitimate government of China.

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,510
By the 1990s, there were fewer points of agreement.

39
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,150
The People's Republic objected to the Taiwanization

40
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,790
of the politics of the island, while increasing numbers of Taiwanese

41
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:51,370
could now legally voice their preference for a formally independent Taiwan.

42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,030
In a rather clumsy and ultimately counterproductive

43
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,450
effort to influence the 1996 presidential elections,

44
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,140
the PRC fired a series of missiles over Keelung and Kaohsiung

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,020
harbors, an action that brought US warships to the edge of the Taiwan

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,290
Strait.

47
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,150
By 1998, the Taiwan-born Nationalist president, Li Denghui,

48
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:22,010
sought to redefine the cross-strait relationship as one between two states.

49
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,550
And although, in the early 1990s, the two sides

50
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,830
had entered into semi-official negotiations

51
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,410
through Taiwan Strait Exchange Foundation

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:36,020
and the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait,

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,290
positions on both sides hardened.

54
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,490
By the year 2000, the political relationship

55
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,940
entered a period of deep chill.

56
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,990
The growth of the Taiwan independence movement

57
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,550
took dramatic form with the election in 2000

58
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,270
to the ROC presidency of the leader of the Democratic Progressive

59
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,360
Party, Mr. Chen Shuibian.

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,710
The DPP had emerged as a strong, largely Taiwanese opposition party to the KMT

61
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,640
in the first years of democratization.

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,540
And under President Chen's administration

63
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,280
the growth of a separate Taiwanese identity was now officially encouraged.

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,920
The Ministry of Education reconstructed the mandatory history curriculum

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,060
for high school students in a manner that largely separated Taiwan's history

66
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,410
from China's.

67
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,700
Museums displayed exhibits depicting Taiwan's past as distinct

68
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,090
from that of China.

69
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,820
The Chen administration also implemented a policy

70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,260
aimed with replacing China with Taiwan in the official name

71
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,590
of as many institutions as possible.

72
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,460
An Institute of Taiwan History arose alongside several Institutes

73
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,110
of Chinese History at the prestigious Academia Sinica.

74
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,110
When one used the word "China," by this point in time,

75
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,240
it now meant only the mainland.

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,590
Chiang Kai-shek's Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei,

77
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:03,160
which had depicted the Generalissimo as a kind of a Chinese Abraham Lincoln--

78
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,110
this was now renamed Freedom Plaza to honor those who

79
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,100
had struggled against Chiang Kai-shek.

80
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,550
Over the course of his eight-year presidency, from 2000 to 2008,

81
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,720
Chen Shuibian's unstated but unmistakable aim

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,320
was to move toward formal independence and separation

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
from the Chinese mainland.

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,610
And in place of a One-China policy, he advocated one China, one Taiwan.

85
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,790
The public emergence of Taiwanese nationalism

86
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,230
coincided, however, with the growth of Chinese nationalism

87
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,800
and growing self-confidence on the mainland.

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,740
Mao Zedong, when he had been interviewed by Edgar Snow in 1936,

89
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,310
had actually indicated support for Taiwan's independence.

90
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,680
But of course, that was when Taiwan was a Japanese colony.

91
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,810
By the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950,

92
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,970
however, Mao had recast Taiwan as Chinese territory

93
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,290
that needed liberation.

94
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,600
Taiwan became then, as it had not been for the majority

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,190
of the Japanese period, terra irredenta, part

96
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,140
of the sacred soil of the motherland, still to be recovered.

97
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,230
And citizens in the People's Republic today

98
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,810
have been taught a history that asserts that Taiwan is, and always has been,

99
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,620
Chinese.

100
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,730
And after the return of Chinese sovereignty to Hong Kong and Macau,

101
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,840
Taiwan's recovery was deemed to be the last frontier in the mission

102
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,010
of national reunification.

103
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,490
That is, of bringing under Chinese rule almost all the provinces

104
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,410
and territories that had comprised the great Qing empire.

105
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,990
So in response to Chen Shuibian's policies in Taiwan,

106
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,150
the PRC passed an anti-secession law, reasserting the right to use force

107
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,960
if Taiwan ever declared independence.

108
00:06:51,960 --> 00:07:00,544
