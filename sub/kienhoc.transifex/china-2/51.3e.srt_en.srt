On The Relationship Between Politics And Literature

1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,600
I have another question regarding the relationship between literature, society and even politics

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,240
and the feasibility of their mutual impact, the likelihood or unlikelihood.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,040
You have mentioned before using the words of Kenzaburō Ōe

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,560
As a writer one is an informer

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,720
Perhaps this reference is actually from Herman Melville's Moby-Dick

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,480
or the bible in the Book of Job.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:49,200
From this perspective how do you see the relationship of writer and society in China?

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,920
When I wrote The Garlic Balleds in 1987 I used a quote

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
Actually I used a phrase attributed to Stalin.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,760
Then someone said where did it come from?

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,560
 I said no, Stalin said it with me.  I was not influenced by his previous sentence.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,160
The little writer is always trying escape from politics,

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,120
but politics always tries to find the little writer

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:25,760
These last couple of years this is the phenomenon that exists for the Chinese writer his whole life.

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,520
That is, literature is always influenced by the ties of politics

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
This includes two sides

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,000
One is during the cultural revolution, because of his writings a writer is toppled.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,040
Another is the relationship itself that innately exists between literature and politics

19
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,880
I think there are these two sides to the issue

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,080
Now I think the harder thing to deal with is the actual relationship between literature and politics

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:01,760
I think there is a misconception that writers should bravely face reality, live head-on

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,160
that is they should be brave

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,320
Any and all of politics and life should be bravely sketched and poked

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,760
I feel this is a misconception

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,080
I have suddenly thought of a game that we used to play as children

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,920
On our street there would be a horse tied to the post

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,080
the horse's personality was fiery, he would often kick people

28
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,600
the children would dare each other to run up and pull a hair off the tail of the horse.

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:42,000
Some of the children were terribly brave and would run up and pull the horse's hair to illustrate their prowess

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
But I don't think this is literature

31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,320
this is not artistic creativity

32
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,560
artistic creativity is using a pen to draw the horse

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,640
you use words to sketch the horse

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,040
even using a camera to capture the horse in a photo

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,720
those are artistic creations, pulling a hair off the tail of a horse is not an artistic creation.

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,000
I feel that when a writer addresses the political issues of society and life it should be in this way.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
that is from an artistic perspective

38
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,120
You treat it as the subject of your artistic creation

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,800
You can write about politics, you can illustrate politics.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,360
But I think we are not here to write about events

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,080
right.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,920
We are also not here to write about processes

43
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,360
Those are the works of historians and journalists.

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,640
Writers should write about the people in politics

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,360
to write about people.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,880
At the time when Shen Congwen was teaching his student Wang Zengqi he taught him four words:

47
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,120
Stay close to the people, write close to the people

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Now I believe us writers in reality should write close to the people

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Including my own writing I learned from Mr. Shen to write close to the people

50
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
I have written about the one-child policy haven't I?

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,760
This can definitely be considered a serious societal issue in China.

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,360
If you want to call it a political issue, you can, if you want to call it a sensitive issue, you can.

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
but I wrote about it

54
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,000
but I think more importantly it's a human issue, an issue of humanity.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,200
I tried through a thousand ways, a hundred means to think of a way to use every detail at my disposal

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,200
to flesh out, to typify the character Gugu in my novel (Frog)

57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,840
But the environment in which she lives

58
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,840
to live in a society with the one-child policy that affects billions of families, a society full of conflict.

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,480
Then I think these issues and events become the backdrop for Gugu the character to be fleshed out

60
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
a means to understand Gugu

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,080
So because I pinned my writing to illustrate people, I think the political issues have become literary

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,360
It really is. I think in the end literature is the related to the study of humanity

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
It is related to the understanding of humanity

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,320
It is a true attempt to use words to touch upon the human condition.

65
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,640
So I think this was a very rare chance to have this opportunity to have a discussion with Mo Yan.

66
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,880
To conclude, Mr. Mo Yan has pointed out again

67
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,280
that the human issue or humanity should serve

68
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,880
as the centerpiece of literary engagement.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,600
Whatever the topic is like, a writer is obliged

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,120
to approach the inner most possibilities of the humanities for good or for ill.

71
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,560
I think this is truly the political core of a writers engagement with a language, with writing.

72
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,320
Thank you.
