On Past Writers And Their Influence

1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,360
Mo Yan's works have been well received

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,920
as a vivid chronicle of the country life

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,360
His works cover a wide range of issues

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,200
particularly the ups and downs

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,040
of the history and the politics of the politics of the PRC

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,840
over the past six decades.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,760
and here, we would like to find out more

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,800
about the way he described the changes

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,880
and the continuities of the countryside

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,480
of Chinese life.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
So from the perspective of the "native-soil" literary movement

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,400
especially since your literature

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,920
particularly when describing China's rural village life

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,720
has incorporated a myriad of resonating layers

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,400
we are terribly curious, that is, as an important writer

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
within the "root-seeking" school

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:59,000
how do you consider traditional descriptions of native soil in modern Chinese literature?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,080
for example in the beginning,

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,720
there was the creation of the "native-soil" literary movement by Lu Xun

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,160
and after 1942, the tradition of Yan'an

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,840
how do you weave these different previous origins of the "native soil movement"

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,800
 into your works?

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,520
I think any writer's writing, in reality

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,120
is influenced by the society and environment in which he exists.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,480
Including at the time, Ah Cheng, Han Shaogong,

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,240
when they created the "root-seeking" movement

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,120
this had to have the necessary background.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,480
At that time it was the 1980s

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,760
China had the opening up and reform

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,520
so many modern western works were translated into Chinese,

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,640
letting the artists and writers in China feel-

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,360
really opened their eyes.

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,520
We never thought that western writers

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,320
already had this method of writing

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,360
so all at once we felt shocked and amazed

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,720
We felt, oh! We can write like this too,

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,760
our lives also have very similar experiences

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,000
so without noticing, we started copying.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,160
Right. Right. Right

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,640
At that time, we looked at Faulkner's novels

41
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,880
Hemingway's novels,

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,920
including Latin America's literature boom

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,480
they have all been copied by our generation of writers

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
I think it was within this backdrop

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
that Han Shaogong and Ah Cheng

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
raised the idea of the "seeking-roots" of literature

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,880
That is to say not to follow and copy western  translated writings

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,280
that we should write our own things

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,000
to write our own things, we need to write our own lives

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,080
then where do we find inspiration?

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,440
This requires us to look at our cultural traditions

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,240
to look at the realities of our daily life, of history

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,040
to find our starting point

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,640
I think this is probably the background of "seeking-roots"

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,560
My generation, the books we read in our youth

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,480
should have been the ones you mentioned earlier,

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,480
one genre are the "red classics"

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,000
the books written after 1942, after the Yan'an talks

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,160
including Sun Li's He Hua Dian (荷花淀)

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,080
Zhao Shuli's Shanyaodan (山藥蛋) literary movement

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Zhou Libo, (Fei Ming's) "Stories of a Bamboo Grove" this group of writer's work

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,840
Then these writers were followed by those in the sixties

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,160
"Tracks in the Snowy Forest"

64
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,160
this group of revolutionary writings, "red classics"

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,360
These were our main progenitors.

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,680
Lu Xun, as a modern writer, his writings can always be read

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,880
But Shen Congwen, Zhang Ailing, this group of writers

68
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,200
in reality, they were censored from history

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,880
We did not read them.

70
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,840
We did not read their books until the middle of the 1980s

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,840
So I think this sort of reading background

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,720
also impacted our writings

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,520
So I think my first writings were still influenced by the "red classics"

74
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,320
right.

75
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,920
I wrote some military novels

76
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,720
I wrote some historical novels

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,800
At this time I had yet to find myself. Right.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,520
In my head I still had a set literary model.

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,400
But after the "seeking-roots" movement,

80
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,920
especially after reading a prolific amount of western literature

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,600
also after "seeking-roots", at this time

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
we felt we should write-

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,520
we not only should write novels with Chinese characteristics,

84
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,040
but as an author one ought to write with one's own style

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,720
This must be different than past works.

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,560
You can call this rebelling,

87
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,760
this sort of rebelling is unconsciously rebelling

88
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,200
right.

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
Of course it is also the path any writer

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,600
who wants to reach the pinnacle must take.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,160
Your writing must be different from all those before you,

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,480
for you to reach the top as one of the best.

93
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,160
Then what to do? You can only turn to your own native-soil

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,920
to find your inspiration

95
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,560
Thus at once, I thought of my childhood.

96
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,040
Then I thought of Northeast Gaomi Township (in Red Sorghum)

97
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,720
Once Northeast Gaomi Township became a literary place in my novel

98
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,640
I feel like it was only then that my writing followed my own path

99
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,480
right. right. right.

100
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,280
I feel like just now you were extremely modest,

101
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,200
From my own reading experience,

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
what I get from your writings

103
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,080
I feel that actually you, when compared to past writers

104
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,200
whether its the May 4th movement's "native-soil" movement,

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,520
or the Yan'an traditions after 1942,

106
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,000
When your writings describe

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,840
the bitter pains of rural Chinese village life,

108
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
or the dark side of this life

109
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
at the same time, you are able to present

110
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,440
a sort of humor, that no one has been able to portray

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,200
This is very unique.

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,120
This especially full and extremely vibrant language

113
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,720
allows this kind of hard and dark backdrop to suddenly feel illuminated

114
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,400
And it's not only this,

115
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,600
but also this compassion.

116
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,520
I personally think this element is what I find so deeply moving.

117
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,440
That is, this empathy, acceptance, and inclusivity towards all different aspects of human life.
