00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:09,440


3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,250
Well, I'm here with my colleague Professor Elizabeth

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,700
Perry, who's the Henry Rosovsky Professor of Government

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,160
here at Harvard.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,610
She's the director of the Harvard-Yenching Institute

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,540
and former director of our Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,470
Liz, welcome.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,720
Thank you very much, Bill.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,230
The Harvard-Yenching Institute is Harvard's oldest continuous

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,810
institutional connection with China, founded in 1928.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,940
Can you tell us a bit about its past and its current activities?

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,140
The Harvard-Yenching Institute actually has

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,260
a unique relationship with Harvard University

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,920
because, although, as you mentioned, it is reflective of Harvard's oldest

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,810
connections with China, it has always been-- both legally

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,750
and financially-- independent of Harvard University.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,400
It is an independent foundation whose core mission

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,830
is to promote higher education in Asia with special focus on China.

20
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,520
But from 1928 on, it's played a very important role--

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,450
both in Asia and also at Harvard University--

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,680
in promoting East Asian studies.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,930
In the 1930s and 1940s, the institute had relationships with half a dozen

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,730
of the Christian colleges in China and provided support, especially

25
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,860
for the study of classical Chinese studies

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,510
at these American-founded universities in China.

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,680
And at the same time, here at Harvard, the institute

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,960
supported the development of what is today

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,980
known as the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations.

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,570
It also builds the Harvard-Yenching Library,

31
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,910
which is the largest university library on East Asia located

32
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,530
outside of East Asia.

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,570
These days, it's very active with some 50 partner universities

34
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,100
all across Asia.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,480
In addition to China, the institute has partnerships

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:13,090
in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia.

37
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,170
It brings over each year approximately 50 scholars

38
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,830
and advanced graduate students from Asia to work together with Harvard faculty--

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,180
sometimes on projects of joint research, sometimes

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,330
more independently on individual research projects.

41
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,860
And if one were to think of the big challenges facing the institute looking

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,300
ahead, either in our relations with China

43
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,550
or more broadly in East Asia, what sets of directions do you think

44
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,925
are the most important?

45
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,900
I think maybe the biggest challenge these days

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,010
is that the intellectual terms of trade between the US and East Asia

47
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,810
and China in particular have been shifting very rapidly in recent years.

48
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,220
So when the institute was first set up, it actually

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,600
had two headquarters-- one located here at Harvard University, another

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,680
on the campus of what was then Yenching University today.

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,150
That campus is the campus of Beijing University, Peking University.

52
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,570
But in those days, the vision was largely

53
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,740
that China had a lot to learn from the West--

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,830
even in the area of classical Chinese studies.

55
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,580
So the institute help to promote Sinology in China,

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,380
but the idea was that America was taking cutting-edge methods of research

57
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,800
to China.

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,930
These days, in the 21st century, we're living in a rather different age when

59
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,740
Chinese universities-- as you well-know because you've

60
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,270
been visiting and writing about many of them--

61
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,050
have been taking off in all different kinds of ways.

62
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:51,150
They're mega-universities with enormous amounts of state investment.

63
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,740
They have some of the world's leading scholars

64
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,700
in all different fields of inquiry, and so I

65
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,070
think one of the key challenges for the institute

66
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:04,870
these days is to be on top of what the cutting-edge scholarship in Asia is

67
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,930
and finding new ways to introduce that scholarship

68
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,600
to an international audience.

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,570
So rather than simply taking American ideas

70
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,300
to China in an old kind of missionary vein,

71
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,190
it's a much more pluralistic higher education world in which we live.

72
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,210
And I think one of the chief responsibilities of the institute

73
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,650
is discovering the exciting new intellectual developments going on

74
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,530
in Asia.

75
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,500
And through new platforms, including using the website of the institute,

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,270
including using a new partnership with the Association for Asian Studies

77
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,000
and so on, providing different venues by which leading Asian scholars will

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,780
have their voices heard here in the US and hopefully more broadly as well.

79
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,600
For those of you who aren't at Harvard who may not know,

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,520
but one of the reasons why we've been as successful as we have or as fortunate

81
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,620
as we have to have the depth of the study of China and of East Asia

82
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,320
are the annual visitors through the Harvard-Yenching Institute

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,740
who bring a cadre of extraordinary scholars--

84
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,270
young scholars-- at the most promising part of their career here to Harvard.

85
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,980
In part, presumably to help their own work and research,

86
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,730
but it enriches us enormously.

87
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,230
Yes.

88
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,220
I think it really is one of the real jewels of Harvard--

89
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,040
that it has this opportunity to bring the brightest young minds of Asia

90
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,970
here by the dozens every year.

91
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,900
By the dozens, yeah.

92
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,420
And increasingly, they are integrated into activities at Harvard

93
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,120
through co-teaching, through mentorships of Harvard faculty, to these visitors,

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,810
and so forth.

95
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,980
So Harvard is in a wonderful position, unlike many other universities

96
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,870
whose support for East Asian studies is heavily

97
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,860
focused on contemporary and social science studies.

98
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,400
The Harvard-Yenching Institute, having a much broader mandate of the humanities

99
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,450
maybe first and the social sciences second, but at least,

100
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,620
both of those wings of the liberal arts represented

101
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,890
allows Harvard to do all kinds of things in East Asian studies

102
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,740
that are often difficult for other universities to manage.

103
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:20,822
