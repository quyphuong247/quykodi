00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,910
As the public health effects of China's environmental problems have increased,

2
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,590
public opinion on environmental issues has grown stronger and louder.

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,300
Environmental protests have occurred periodically since the late 1970s.

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,970
Of 278 reported world disputes on environmental issues

5
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,420
between the mid '70s and the mid 1990s, 47 involved sabotage and rioting,

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,440
so people have become angry.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,730
Between 1996 and 2011, the number of environmental protests

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:47,710
increased annually by about 30% a year, with 120% jump between 2010 and 2011

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,280
alone, problems seeming to get worse.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,950
Half of all the protests in China, in the year 2013, that

11
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,200
had over 10,000 participants were focused on environmental issues.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,340
According to a 2014 survey by Shanghai Jiao Tong University,

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,050
of Chinese citizens in 35 cities, 60% of them

14
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,400
wanted the government to prioritize environmental protection

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,460
in its economic planning.

16
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,480
And this, happily, is what the current Chinese government is promising to do.

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,190
In his March 2014 speech to the National People's Congress,

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,270
Premier Li Keqiang addressed growing popular concern over the environment

19
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,870
by announcing that air, soil, water, and pollution

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,670
were "nature's red-light warning against the model

21
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,850
of inefficient and blind development".

22
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,310
His State of the Nation speech made it clear

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,620
the degree to which the Chinese government is now

24
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,490
dedicated to addressing the environmental crisis in China.

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,410
The government has demonstrated that when

26
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,720
it prioritizes environmental protection, it can achieve results.

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,940
Chris Nielsen, whom we shall meet in an interview, the executive director

28
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,660
of Harvard's China Project on the environment, he and his colleague, Mun

29
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,380
Ho, have called China's sulfur dioxide emissions

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,780
reduction plan one of the most swiftly effective air pollution

31
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,060
policies ever implemented anywhere.

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,550
Premier Li Keqiang has said that China, "will declare war against pollution

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:30,980
and fight it with the same determination in which we battled poverty."

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,640
The question will still remain, will China's new determination

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,010
be enough and will it be in time to counter

36
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,560
China's extraordinary environmental challenges?

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,128
