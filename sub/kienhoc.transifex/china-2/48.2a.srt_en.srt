00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,160
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:01:09,130


3
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,230
WILLIAM KIRBY: Professor Jin Fujun has just

4
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:17,130
given us the history of the building we've just seen and are about to see.

5
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,080
And I want to welcome you all to Tsinghua University.

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,215
Tsinghua University is one of China's great universities.

7
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:26,050
It's one of the world's great universities,

8
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,890
and it began in the quarters behind me, a set of royal gardens

9
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,030
and royal houses from 1707, during the Kangxi realm, which

10
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,650
became when the university was established

11
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,060
in 1911 an area of administration.

12
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,020
And it is today one of the central meeting parts of Tsinghua University.

13
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,470
This great international university known for science and engineering,

14
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,860
and now also again for the humanities and the arts

15
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,240
had royal origins, and rather humble and beautiful origins.

16
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,610
It is called the gong zi ting because when viewed from the air

17
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,000
the buildings have the shape of the Chinese character gong for work.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,030
It became the first home of the Office of Student Affairs of the new Tsinghua

19
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,510
College in 1911, an office that was then known by the students as the Yamen.

20
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,850
It is now the Office of the President of the University.

21
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,010
Presidents are very wise to choose the very best real estate

22
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,380
that they can to have their offices.

23
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,680
And President Chen Jining's offices are behind me here

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,240
at the gong zi ting at Tsinghua.

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,720
To reflect a bit on the history of Tsinghua

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,230
you can also see behind me the calligraphy

27
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,050
of Mao Zedong with his famous saying "wei renmin fuwu," to serve the people.

28
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,750


29
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,290
Behind me is a place where Liang Qichao the great reformer

30
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,750
of the movement of 1898.

31
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,760
One of the leading, perhaps the most influential political thinker

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,410
of the 20th century in China, lived and taught

33
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:14,190
when he was part of the guoxueyuan, the center or academy of classical studies

34
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,540
here at Tsinghua University.

35
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,540
We think of Tsinghua University today primarily

36
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,250
as a place of extraordinary engineering, and science and technology,

37
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,760
but in the 1920s it was at the absolute heart of studying both east and west,

38
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,200
the Chinese classics through Western methodology.

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,010
Liang Qichao was one of its leaders.

40
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,360
Chen Yinke, who studied at Harvard and Berlin,

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,600
taught here at Tsinghua University as well,

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,840
and lived in this very traditional setting

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,800
before marching out to teach the students,

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,690
and speak to them in an American style auditorium

45
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:57,520
of the new university of the 1920s.

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,830
We're here at the back of the gong zi ting.

47
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:07,220
This beautiful imperial garden surrounded by a southern Chinese style

48
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,000
rock garden, you shan you shui, and we see

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,860
the origins of the name of Tsinghua, the Tsinghua yuan and the Tsinghua Garden

50
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,350
behind us.

51
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,440
Many universities have rather prosaic names.

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,250
Harvard University is named for its first donor.

53
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,590
Tsinghua has a rather more beautiful name.

54
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:32,220
You can see its origins here, "shui mu qing hua," the water and the trees

55
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,750
are pure and flowering.

56
00:04:33,750 --> 00:05:30,190


57
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,000
If you look behind me you'll see a building

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,085
that looks very much like American academic architecture.

59
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,820
It's the Grand Auditorium, built in 1917,

60
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,600
at a time when it could hold in its 1,200 seats

61
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,490
every member of the Tsinghua community, students, faculty, administrators,

62
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,110
built indeed by an American architect.

63
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,110
There is an American origin to Tsinghua University

64
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,620
that's actually very important.

65
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,190
When the Qing dynasty lost the Boxer War it

66
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,240
was required to pay to the United States an extraordinary indemnity,

67
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,330
and to the other powers.

68
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,760
Some $30 million to the United States.

69
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,830
And Secretary of State John Hay became convinced

70
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,742
that this was an exorbitant sum.

71
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:16,700
And he convinced President Roosevelt who somehow convinced the American

72
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,120
Congress to return some of this money to China,

73
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,600
to return it to the Qing, some $10.8 million,

74
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,380
so that this money could be used to send and support Chinese students who

75
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,290
would study in American universities.

76
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,280
An extraordinarily farsighted goal.

77
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,530
Tsinghua Xuetang,-- Tsinghua Imperial College

78
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,850
began for this particular purpose as a preparatory school

79
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,370
to prepare young Chinese to study in American universities.

80
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,350
Started as an Imperial College in April 1911,

81
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:03,440
it became Tsinghua College in 1912 after the Republican revolution.

82
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,050
It would become a full university really only in 1924.

83
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,210
And you can see the university buildings,

84
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,700
which would be the envy of any university

85
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,330
in the world in the 19-teens and '20s.

86
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,960
This lovely auditorium behind me.

87
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,260
Classroom buildings to the left.

88
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,250
Far over here a building still called the Tsinghua Xuetang

89
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,360
where the great Guoxueyuan of the 1920s and 1930s was housed.

90
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,410
The original science building over to this side.

91
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,980
So Tsinghua has this extraordinary history.

92
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,450
It started its own graduate school really in 1929.

93
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,455
And having become by then Guoli Tsinghua Daxue, one

94
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:52,790
of the great national universities of the national government

95
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,250
of the republican government, under Jiang jieshi,

96
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,200
under Chiang Kai-Shek, all of its students and faculty who could

97
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,350
and who were patriotic enough to do it would

98
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,630
leave Beijing, which was then Beiping.

99
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,840
In 1937 and 1938 when Tsinghua with other great Chinese universities

100
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,000
became part of United Southwest University, lianda, to keep learning,

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,790
keep studying, and keep teaching during the anti Japanese struggle

102
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,220
that would last for eight years.

103
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,900
After the war of course the communists would win the civil war,

104
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,110
and Tsinghua University, as we'll see in from a different architectural point

105
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,350
of view, would become a Soviet style university.

106
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,789
Its humanities distinctions of the Guoxueyuan

107
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,179
would come to a crashing end.

108
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,290
It would become what you might think of as a Polytechnic in the Soviet model,

109
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:55,530
a fine and strong college and university of science and engineering.

110
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,160
But its social science departments would be closed.

111
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,450
Its scholars moved to other departments, in many cases purged.

112
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,110
And Tsinghua would not regain its eminence in the social sciences

113
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,310
and humanities really until late into the 20th century.

114
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,870
What does this university stand for?

115
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,290
What are its mottos?

116
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,620
And what are its beliefs?

117
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,960
The official motto of Tsinghua University is, "zi qiang bu xi,

118
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,300
hou de zai wu," which is officially translated as,

119
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,680
"self discipline and social commitment."

120
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,670
The class of 1920 had a simpler idea for what

121
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,170
education was about, and for what engagement in society would mean.

122
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:46,330
They wrote, "xing sheng yu yan," "actions speak louder than words."

123
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:57,290
Or as they wrote on the back in Latin "facta non verba."

124
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,120
We're here in front of the original gate of Tsinghua College

125
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,130
built in 1911 when the Qing was entering its final year of rule.

126
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,590
This gate would survive extraordinarily well, better

127
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,240
in many ways than the university.

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,000
It would survive the war.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,550
It would survive the collapse of the national government

130
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,270
and the arrival of the communists.

131
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,080
It would survive the Sovietation of Tsinghua University.

132
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,720
But it would not survive the Cultural Revolution

133
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,350
when it would be torn down and replaced by a statue of Chairman Mao.

134
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,040
Remarkably, Chairman Mao is gone, at least from this spot,

135
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,400
and the great gate of Tsinghua, now Tsinghua University, would be rebuilt.

136
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,980
There are a number of other universities in China where statues of Chairman Mao

137
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,150
still can be found guarding their entrance.

138
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,585
One president of one of these universities,

139
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,220
I had the time to ask him, the occasion to ask him,

140
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,330
why do you still have a statue of Chairman Mao on your campus?

141
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,240
And he said to me in a quiet voice, well,

142
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:21,730
we missed our opportunity to take it down in the 1980s.

143
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,190
So we're here in front of the first building

144
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,170
built expressly for the new Tsinghua Xuetang, the new Tsinghua Imperial

145
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,644
Academy.

146
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,310
And you can see from the letters at the top that's what it says.

147
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,730
Tsinghua Xuetang, xuantong xinhai.

148
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,410
In the xinhai year of the Xuantong Emperor's reign, which as it turned out

149
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,530
would be the last year of the Xuantong emperor, who would be, as we know,

150
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,490
the last emperor of China, because the Xinhai

151
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,740
Revolution, the Revolution of 1911, would overthrow

152
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,960
the Qing and a 2,000 year imperial tradition.

153
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,570
This building would come to house some of the most famous scholars

154
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:05,800
in the humanities and social sciences in China in the 19-teens and in the 1920s.

155
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,010
And it would come to epitomize, for a university that

156
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,430
was founded with Chinese money to be sure

157
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,900
but return from a Western government, the intersection between west and east

158
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,420
in China and in scholarship.

159
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,170
The scholars here at Tsinghua University in what

160
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:32,510
would become the Guoxueyuan, the study of the center of Chinese studies,

161
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:38,100
would value intersection in the science and the humanities ancient and modern,

162
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,090
east and west.

163
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,150
Wang Guowei.

164
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,350
Liang Qichao.

165
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,460
Chen Yinke.

166
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,930
Zhao Yuanren.

167
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,430
The famous four tutors of the Guoxueyuan advocated this concept perhaps

168
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:56,520
more than any other group of scholars in Republican China.

169
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,640
Liang Qichao taught in this building from 1925 to 1927.

170
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,270
Wang Guowei taught classics and history here in the same period.

171
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,170
Zhao Yuanren, who had come back from Harvard, where he had studied,

172
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,980
entered the Guoxueyuan and founded the study of modern linguistics here.

173
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,820
Chen Yinke, who had studied at Harvard in the teens, came here in the 1920s

174
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,860
also to be part of the Guoxueyuan, studying Chinese history

175
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,180
using the tools of modern archaeology and Wissenschaft,

176
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,650
for he had also been to Berlin, in a way that had not

177
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,250
happened in a leading Chinese institution of higher learning before.

178
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,080
In this same building behind me the Philosophy Department of Tsinghua

179
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,900
would be found.

180
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,720
Feng Youlan studied with John Dewey in the 1920s,

181
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,250
and in 1926 he'd founded the Department of Philosophy here at Tsinghua.

182
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,770
Jiang Tingfu taught here from 1925 to 1935,

183
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,990
chaired the Department of History, ran the program

184
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,490
on the study of China's international relations.

185
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,990
He was a great historian of China's international relations,

186
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,670
and the study of diplomatic history in Qing and into Republican times.

187
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,840
And my teacher, the founder of modern Chinese studies at Harvard, John

188
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,850
Fairbank, came to Tsinghua University to study with Jiang Tingfu in 1932.

189
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,790
And it was here with Jiang Tingfu that he learned those basic elements of Qing

190
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,890
history, of Qing foreign relations that would allow

191
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,920
him to write for his dissertation and then the great book, Trade

192
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,200
and Diplomacy on the China Coast, under his real mentor

193
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,180
in Chinese history, Jiang Tingfu.

194
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,700
We've seen the original Tsinghua xuetang and the very humble beginnings

195
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,100
of what would become this enormous and great international university,

196
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,470
a university that now has some 3,000 academic staff,

197
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,630
has more than 50 undergraduate programs, has

198
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,800
more than 100 programs of doctoral study,

199
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,890
has become the leading center of science and engineering in China.

200
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,850
Most difficult university to get into in all of China,

201
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,700
and one of the most difficult in the world to gain admission to.

202
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,940
A place that has educated the leaders of China

203
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,850
in recent times, Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping, all

204
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,660
graduates of Tsinghua University.

205
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,850
Tsinghua University, having been and become the great center of science

206
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:38,020
and engineering, is now rediscovering its roots as it were in the humanities.

207
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,660
And you can see behind me the enormous new theater and great concert

208
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,211
hall that are not Tsinghua xuetang, but xin Tsinghua xuetang, New Tsinghua

209
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:48,710
Hall.

210
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:54,010


211
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:59,990
So we're in the xin Tsinghua xuetang, the New Tsinghua,

212
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,510
the Tsinghua of the 21st century, the Tsinghua of Tsinghua's 2nd century,

213
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,930
built for its centenary in 2011.

214
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:17,060
As a result this magnificent theater has exactly 2011 seats.

215
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,130
Built with the assistance not of Boxer returned

216
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,400
funds, but assistance of a more modern sort.

217
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,900
Built by the generosity of Tsinghua donors,

218
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,620
of Tsinghua alumni in China and overseas who've

219
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,440
given generously for this centennial project

220
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,680
to put Tsinghua at the center of the arts scene in contemporary Beijing

221
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,570
and in China.

222
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,440
And to tell us a bit more about Tsinghua and the arts

223
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,350
let me introduce Mr. Cui Kai who is the Director of Arts Education

224
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,900
here at Tsinghua University.

225
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

226
00:16:50,900 --> 00:22:22,690


227
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,130
WILLIAM KIRBY: This theater would be the envy of any university in the United

228
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,020
States, and my colleagues in the arts at Harvard

229
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,470
could not have put better, as Mr. Cui put it, what the role of the arts

230
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,870
is in a comprehensive education.

231
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,965
Thank you very much.

232
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:39,590
CUI KAI: Xiexie

233
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,530
WILLIAM KIRBY: Thank you.

234
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:58,923
