Introducing Writing China

1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,040
So, we have had many thematic field trips

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,520
Agricultural China

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,560
Environmental China

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,720
Educational China

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,200
and now we have a field trip into the lives and works

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,480
of two extraordinary writers

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,120
Writing China

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,400
and in this we will be led by my colleague

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,920
in our Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,080
Professor David Wang

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,440
perhaps the leading scholar of Chinese literature in this country

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,760
and by the extraordinary multimedia journalist

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,760
Christopher Lydon, who went to Shanghai as part of this mission

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,840
So Yu Hua was born in 1960, in Zhejiang

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,320
worked as a dentist for five years

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,080
before beginning to write in 1983

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,880
he's published four novels, six collections of stories

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,160
his work has been translated into multiple languages

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,640
and he became the first Chinese writer

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,720
to win the James Joyce Foundation award

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,080
and the Cavour award for his novel, "To Live"

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,120
He's also the author of a remarkable book which I recommend to all of you

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,440
who are acquainting yourselves with China for the first time

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,920
and it's called "China in Ten Words"

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,800
and it's something that I assign to all undergraduates

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,240
in our introductory class

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,480
I know you will enjoy that conversation

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,600
and you will also enjoy meeting Mo Yan

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
who will be interviewed by Professor David Wang

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
Mo Yan, born in 1955, from Shandong province

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,760
short story writer and novelist

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,840
won the 2012 Nobel Prize for Literature

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,560
He's known in particular for his romantic historical story, "Red Sorghum"

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,480
which later became an extraordinary film

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,080
He's the author of multiple works

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,040
1995, a work called "Big Breasts and Wide Hips"

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
caused some controversy

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
both for its sexual content

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,320
and for its "failure to depict class struggle"

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,640
according to the party line

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,400
and he was forced to write also

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
and I'm sure it's very well written

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,760
a self-criticism of the book.

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,680
I think you're going to find this a very interesting field trip.
