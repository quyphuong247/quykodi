1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,870
BILL KIRBY: Let me ask you just one final question.

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,940
We're here in Shanghai in 2014.

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,350
If we looked ahead to 2034, we're back here.

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,260
We might be a little older.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,427
As we look out this window--

6
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,760
CHRIS NIELSEN: We will be older.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,780
BILL KIRBY: We will actually be older.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,200
If we're lucky, we'll be here.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,970
And so we're here in 2034.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,850
Is the air going to be better?

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,560
Is the environmental situation in China going to be better?

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,170
Chris?

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,250
Yes or no.

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,291
CHRIS NIELSEN: I think-- yes, I think it will be.

15
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:47,760
BILL KIRBY: Mike?

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,815
MICHAEL MCELROY: Yes, yes.

17
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,065
BILL KIRBY: Well, that's good.

18
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:50,820
That makes me--

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,295
MICHAEL MCELROY: But the question is, why is it better?

20
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,960
BILL KIRBY: OK.

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,700
And you think it'll be better because there'll be no energy use whatsoever?

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,200
MICHAEL MCELROY: There are two ways which it can get better.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,339
One is, in fact, that the economy doesn't, in fact, develop.

24
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,630
And the other way is that we actually solve the problem

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,020
and the economy develops.

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,760
BILL KIRBY: OK.

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,600
MICHAEL MCELROY: I think that's our challenge.

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,010
I might just say that I think that it's interesting to look at California.

29
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,125
But my sense is that California leading the nation largely

30
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,837
had to do with the automobile and air quality issues

31
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,920
related to the automobile.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,524
It did not have to do with the challenge of climate change or renewable energy

33
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:35,380
development.

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,100
And carbon tax is one way to go about stimulating

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,890
the economics to go where you want it to go.

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,130
Carbon trading that people, including our friend Rob Stavins,

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,540
would be in favor of is another way to do it.

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,070
But, as I think we all know, having that happen in the United States

39
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,470
in particular is a very long shot, politically, at the moment.

40
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,060
Carbon taxes are not a very popular thing in Washington.

41
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,070
BILL KIRBY: Having anything happen in the United States

42
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,710
politically these days is very difficult.

43
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,501
MICHAEL MCELROY: So, the other way in which

44
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:05,700
you can do it is to look at what happened in Germany

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,590
and which actually is happening in California and in Massachusetts.

46
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,456
In Germany, they introduced something called a feed-in tariff

47
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:19,590
to encourage the development of renewable energy sources.

48
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,230
And they did it in a very clever way.

49
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,641
The feed-in tariff could be changed every year for any particular energy

50
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:27,140
source.

51
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,990
So, for example, if you wanted to put solar cells on your roof,

52
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,680
you would get a guarantee of a particular price

53
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,210
for 30 years for the electricity produced from your solar cells.

54
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,520
Now, if you put these solar cells up next year,

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,936
that price could be different because the government could

56
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:45,490
change the feed-in tariff price every year.

57
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,900
And the feed-in tariff for wind-- offshore, onshore--

58
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,990
would be different from solar and so on and so forth.

59
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,650
So this is a way in which the government could actually

60
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,370
provide incentives that developed the energy alternatives that

61
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,490
were carbon free, essentially, in this particular way

62
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,090
and could actually guide it along the way as they did it.

63
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,030
Now, what did that do?

64
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,770
It led to the fact that Germany still has the world's largest

65
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,500
investment in photovoltaic devices.

66
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,645
It also developed wind in a very significant way.

67
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,270
But it has to be done in the right way.

68
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,394
Spain, for example, did the same kind of thing-- this feed-in tariff thing.

69
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:31,050
But in the case of Spain, they failed to ensure that the price of this

70
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,990
was going to be passed on to the consumer.

71
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,650
In Germany, the price was automatically passed on to the consumer.

72
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,830
Now, the feed-in tariff concept is what's actually working in California

73
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,820
and in Massachusetts in terms of utilities

74
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,750
having a requirement to provide a certain amount of electricity that

75
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,930
comes from renewable sources.

76
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,830
So we just put solar cells on our roof of our house in Cape Cod.

77
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,860
Solar cells were put on the roof of the house in Cape Cod

78
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,830
by a company called Solar City.

79
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,310
Solar City owns the solar cells on the roof of my house.

80
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,060
They are selling the power to the grid.

81
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,660
They are running my meter in reverse.

82
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:20,209
I paid $2,000 up front to have the solar cells managed by Solar City.

83
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,329
And I have a guaranteed electricity price of half

84
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,610
what I was currently paying.

85
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,930
It's an incredible deal.

86
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,610
How is Solar City able to do this thing?

87
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,425
They're able to do it because they are packaging the renewable energy they

88
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:34,240
are getting from solar investments like mine,

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,287
and they're selling it on an auction to the utilities that

90
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,120
have to have a certain amount of electricity

91
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,492
coming from renewable sources.

92
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:42,200
They're also taking advantage of the fact

93
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,910
that on Cape Cod, electricity prices-- retail price of electricity

94
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,610
I was paying was $0.26 a kilowatt hour.

95
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,100
In Cambridge, it's $0.19.

96
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,640
Half of the price is, in fact, the delivery cost,

97
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,850
and half is the generation cost.

98
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,650
But if you can run your meter in reverse,

99
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,680
you're selling electricity at retail prices.

100
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,490
So in the case of Solar City, they're selling electricity

101
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,730
to the grid at $0.26 a kilowatt hour.

102
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,082
So up to a point, those are the clever things

103
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:11,790
that you can do that actually encourage--

104
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,998
BILL KIRBY: It'll be very interesting-- I don't know, but if you take a train

105
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:18,050
and go anywhere in and around this Shanghai area into the countryside,

106
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,550
you'll see virtually every farmer's house now with solar power panels,

107
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,790
either for hot water or for other forms.

108
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,240
MICHAEL MCELROY: But just to make a point here, the price of PV panels

109
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,270
has come screaming down worldwide, largely because of what China has done.

110
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,167
So the price of putting a watt of photovoltaic stuff

111
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:48,180
on your roof in Germany or in the United States or in China

112
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,290
is $0.75 a watt right now.

113
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,610
And it's the lowest price it's ever been to.

114
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,530
The reason that it is expensive still to have solar in the United States

115
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,487
is because of what's called the soft costs of actually putting it

116
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:02,270
on the roof-- getting permission, permitting,

117
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,750
all of that stuff, regulatory considerations.

118
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,477
And I think that that can change very rapidly and can affect--

119
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:11,810
CHRIS NIELSEN: Well, I've just--

120
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,893
BILL KIRBY: Chris, please.

121
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:14,490
And then we'll have to close up.

122
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,580
CHRIS NIELSEN: It's interesting you're talking about the solar cell business

123
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,940
here because you asked before, can China be a leader in this?

124
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,640
In a sense, I think it's in fact true that Chinese subsidies

125
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,610
of this industry-- in a sense, these industries

126
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,120
grew so fast in China because they're subsidized

127
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,740
by the Chinese government-- has had an impact on the rest of the world.

128
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,810
I mean, solar power is cheaper in Germany and the United States

129
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,590
in part because of Chinese subsidies.

130
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,629
So actually, we're a beneficiary of these subsidies.

131
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,670
MICHAEL MCELROY: But on the other hand, what happened as a result of that

132
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,120
was that a number of solar companies in the United States

133
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,560
protested that the Chinese were dumping.

134
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,760
And what did the Chinese do?

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,790
They actually filed a complaint against the US

136
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,199
for dumping low-cost silicon in China.

137
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,240
BILL KIRBY: You know, I would go-- you could say,

138
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
maybe the future will be the German solution.

139
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,040
I've just come to our conference here in Shanghai from Germany.

140
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,355
A good friend of mine who is running this conference

141
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,820
is the leading sinologist in Berlin.

142
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,310
He lives in a house that is carbon free.

143
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:35,787
And it uses groundwater heated natural--

144
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:36,870
CHRIS NIELSEN: Geothermal.

145
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,700
BILL KIRBY: Geothermal.

146
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
It used geothermal systems.

147
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,690
It's a remarkable house.

148
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:49,210
And yet, he still drives a wonderful Audi at 200 kilometers an hour

149
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,060
on the Autobahn.

150
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,860
That to me is some kind of ideal compromise.

151
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,580
MICHAEL MCELROY: He should by a Tesla.

152
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,871
BILL KIRBY: You know, he might.

153
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:57,670
He just might.

154
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,400
He's got great taste in cars.

155
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,510
Well, in just the short time that we've been talking--

156
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,490
to show the influence of these two gentlemen--

157
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,010
the air has really cleaned up nicely here in Shanghai.

158
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,509
So Mike McElroy, Chris Nielson, thank you very much.

159
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:13,550
CHRIS NIELSEN: Thank you.

160
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,410
MICHAEL MCELROY: Thank you.

161
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,419
