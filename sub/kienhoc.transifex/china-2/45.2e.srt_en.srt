1
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,980
In addition to the infrastructure, you also

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,240
have this other thing that was neglected during this period, was housing.

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,855
There was essentially no housing built between the late '50s

4
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:26,120
and the late 1970s.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,680
Then China began to build some housing in the '80s, as well as office

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,080
buildings, and so on, but nothing very dramatic.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:42,820
It picks up in the '90s, and then takes off massively in the 2000s.

8
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:49,180
If you look at the bottom figure in the table, between 2005 and 2011,

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,240
they built enough housing for well over 100 million people,

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,020
and you can see this enormous acceleration.

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,890
They're already building quite a bit in the '80s and '90s.

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,319
And then you get this big acceleration in the 2000s,

13
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,470
and particularly the latter part of the 2000s.

14
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:15,220
In the seven years, 2005 to 2011, you're producing enough housing

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,650
to house people at 100 square meters.

16
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:23,550
Now remember, the average household had 18 square meters back in 1978.

17
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,320
100 square meters is good.

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,640
For people who have suburban McMansions in the US, that's not so good.

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,670
But in China that's a good big apartment.

20
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,990
And that's enough to house 110-115 million families of three.

21
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,350
That's 300 million people in seven years.

22
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,630
So you're having this massive housing building,

23
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,710
at which now the good news on that is that you're really doing a lot.

24
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,250
You've solved the housing problem of China.

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,890
The bad news is you can't keep on doing that.

26
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,330
China doesn't need enough housing for 300 million people every seven years.

27
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,280
I mean they're tearing down some housing, and so on.

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,860
So what you have is you're either going to be

29
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,840
building lots of empty houses for investment purposes.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,240
And there is a problem that because people

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,025
don't have other places to invest, a standard form of investment

32
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:28,030
now in China is to invest in a second apartment, a third apartment, a fourth

33
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,540
and fifth.

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,820
I mean the government tries to prevent it.

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,600
But they nevertheless do it.

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,860
And the track record is, of course, of housing prices going up at such a rate

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,830
that it seems like a safe investment.

38
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,330
Yeah.

39
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,550
And as long as you're in Beijing and Shanghai,

40
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,570
you probably are going to keep going up maybe.

41
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,670
But for the rest the country, or much of the rest of the country,

42
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,320
it's already a bubble that in many cases has already burst.

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,700
And you have lots of empty apartments that no one can use really.

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,010
The extreme examples are in places like inner Mongolia,

45
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,250
where they created a whole sort of suburban area, which

46
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,070
is mainly empty with people, and so on.

47
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,240
So the housing, the roads, there's not-- you can build more highways, and so on.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,870
But you're not having the same impact.

49
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,370
A multi-lane expressway in the far Western part

50
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,230
of China that doesn't have the same impact as building one

51
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,700
in the Eastern coastal areas, where there is a lot of traffic,

52
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,810
and a real need for those kinds of things.

53
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,980
And the number of airports, I mean how many more

54
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,580
fancy new airports do you need?

55
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,980
Well, probably not very many for a while.

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,670
The railroad is still a way to go.

57
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,660
And then there's some other big problems.

58
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,270
But basically the infrastructure investment, the other big one

59
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,820
is moving water to the north.

60
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,560
Because China has a huge water problem, shortage in the north.

61
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,420
And they're trying to move the Yangtze River

62
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,900
water north to help solve that problem, the way in the US,

63
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:07,550
we have used the Colorado to basically provide substantial supplements

64
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,830
to California, and keep Arizona from becoming a total desert.

65
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,370
All that's suggesting that that source of growth is going to come to an end.

66
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,019
It isn't going to stop.

67
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,320
It's going to slow down.

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,630
And it's one of the reasons you're seeing a slowdown.

69
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,030
If you look at the GDP growth figures, they're beginning to slow down.

70
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,900
The reason they got into this is that China's household consumption

71
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,180
has grown more slowly than GDP.

72
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,220
And incomes have grown more slowly than GDP.

73
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,660
Now they're not slow.

74
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,190
They're growing very rapidly.

75
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,380
Incomes have grown.

76
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,520
In both the urban and rural areas, the household growth

77
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,730
has been very substantial.

78
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,320
But it's much slower than GDP growth.

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,390
And so what you've had is a gap with household consumption becoming

80
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,530
a smaller and smaller share of GDP.

81
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,880
And that leaves a huge gap.

82
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,280
If you're going to maintain sort of full employment of your resources,

83
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
you have to find something, a substitute.

84
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,630
Well you could have a huge export surplus.

85
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,860
You'd expand exports.

86
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,090
But China, it makes no sense to keep on expanding exports,

87
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,295
without expanding imports.

88
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:21,100
It's the net of exports over imports that

89
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,810
creates demand for domestic production.

90
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,450
The only country that has anything comparable is the US.

91
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,470
And that's because we print our own dollars.

92
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,630
And they're considered, at least for a while,

93
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,650
they're still the major international currency.

94
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,720
So exports are also slowing down.

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,330
And you fill that gap with this infrastructure program, the housing

96
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,440
program, for a time.

97
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,710
But that's now running out of steam.

98
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,870
And so what you're getting, and here you have a new government, Xi Jinping.

99
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,000
And you have Li Keqiang.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,250
And we'll find out soon in more detail what they're actually going to do.

101
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,170
I think there's a widespread view that they will go back

102
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,330
to doing some of these reforms that we've

103
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,300
talked about that Wen Jiabao and Hu Jintao didn't do.

104
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,010
It'll be cleaning up the financial sector, and probably

105
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,420
a variety of financial reforms, things of that sort,

106
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,060
things that will increase productivity growth.

107
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,860
Because they're going to have to get their future growth more from increases

108
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,210
in productivity, and not from these massive investment projects.

109
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,860
Let's assume that you are advising Xi Jinping and Li

110
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,110
Keqiang on their policies.

111
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,520
And they have many, many big issues to deal with.

112
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,550
Let's just take two.

113
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,080
One of them is income inequality.

114
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,126
And the other is corruption.

115
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,960
Let's take the first.

116
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,190
China has had over the last 30 years, growing

117
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:50,440
at least in formal income, inequality between rural and urban areas,

118
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,200
within different parts of societies, with society within urban areas.

119
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,520
Many people in China, or at least some people in China, look back

120
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,810
and they say, sometimes nostalgically, well at least in Chairman Mao's day

121
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,144
we were equally poor.

122
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,060
In fact, I don't think they were equally poor.

123
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,601
Some people--

124
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:11,800
No, they weren't actually.

125
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,430
Very uneven.

126
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,780
But what prescriptions would you give for this,

127
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,870
if you think it is a major economic problem for China?

128
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,095
Inequality is certainly a part of the problem.

129
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:29,090
It actually overlaps with another problem, which is corruption.

130
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,200
One major source of it is simply that the gap

131
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,582
between the rural and urban incomes has gotten wider and wider,

132
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:38,330
as urban incomes are quite a bit higher.

133
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,890
And that has expanded over time.

134
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,890
That's probably going to come to an end, in part

135
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,560
because most of the younger people in the countryside

136
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,390
are now working in cities, or at least they're out of agriculture.

137
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:00,020
90% of the people between 18 and 40 years old are no longer in agriculture.

138
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,880
So it's the low wage earners left in the countryside that also contribute.

139
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,520
Well, except what happens is these 18 to 40 year olds often have their parents,

140
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,870
and even often leave their children in the countryside.

141
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,680
And that's because of the household registration

142
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,970
system, the so-called hukou system.

143
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,220
And so they actually send a lot of their money back to the countryside.

144
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,350
So now a lot of the income in the countryside

145
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,970
is actually wages of family members who are in the cities,

146
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,130
sending the wages back, which has kept their income growing.

147
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,530
Poverty in large parts of China is still very real.

148
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,010
But it's much less than it was, not only in numbers of poverty,

149
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,340
but what is considered poverty is not as severe in many cases,

150
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,170
as it was 20 years ago.

151
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,810
Now so that's part of the problem.

152
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,740
Part of it is this rural/urban.

153
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,490
As people move out of the rural areas that becomes less and less significant.

154
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,860
Because they all move into the urban areas.

155
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,710
But within the urban areas, you now have wages

156
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,500
that are largely determined by market forces.

157
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,380
That has many advantages for efficiency.

158
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,310
But it also means the government doesn't have

159
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,810
a lot of direct control over those wages.

160
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,650
Then you get into the question, well what is causing the high Incomes?

161
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,990
A lot of it is skills.

162
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,970
It's not the only thing that gets them to invest in education and get skills,

163
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,470
and so on.

164
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,330
But it's one of the things that does.

165
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,630
And then you have the very highly skilled,

166
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,180
for example, that get PhDs in the US, and so on.

167
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,350
To get them to come home, you often have to pay

168
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,890
them close to international wages.

169
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,530
Just in the field of economics, which I know best,

170
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:52,230
if you take the ones who got PhDs from major American schools that are back

171
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,360
in China at the elite schools, they're getting

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,310
paid as well as an American professor in the US would get paid.

173
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,160
And that's because they have to match.

174
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,980
So there's a lot of that kind of inequality going on.

175
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,680
The huge incomes, of course, are more entrepreneurial incomes,

176
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,220
and the people who have what economists like to call access to rents.

177
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,310
And rents can often be pure corruption.

178
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,930
And in terms of politics, I think the danger

179
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,440
is-- I don't think people look at Gini coefficients,

180
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,780
and decide that they're going to get radical,

181
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,710
because the Gini coefficient went up.

182
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,720
What they do is they look at the people who become rich.

183
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,900
And if the people who become rich because they've

184
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,640
actually created something important that doesn't bother very many people.

185
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,550
In the US context, I don't think that many people

186
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,900
are bothered by Bill Gates being wealthy.

187
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,020
But when you get rich because you have political connections,

188
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,890
and you can get special favors from the government.

189
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:10,650
You can get a company through the regulatory process

190
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,510
by just sitting on their board.

191
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,660
You don't have to actually do anything.

192
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,095
You can just sit on their board, or you can be the consultant.

193
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,290
And you're going to be paid a lot of money,

194
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,570
because the company will then go to these local officials who

195
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,280
are obstructing, or in their view obstructing what they want

196
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,460
to do where they need to get permission.

197
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,210
And say, look we have-- they don't even have to say it.

198
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,240
We have so-and-so on the board.

199
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,460
They can see the papers.

200
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,170
He's the close relative, or the son or the daughter

201
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,730
of somebody very, very powerful.

202
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,290
And you don't want to offend that person.

203
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,800
You don't have to say any of these things.

204
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,120
The local officials are going to know.

205
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,100
And so you're willing to pay these enormous amounts of money,

206
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,140
and give favors and stock options and all kinds of things.

207
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:07,040
That is-- I don't know how much that really drives the Gini coefficient.

208
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,860
But it's clearly a major source of resentment in the society

209
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,510
that these kinds of incomes are illegitimate.

210
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,200
And that's clearly a problem.

211
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,750
There are a variety of things you can try to do.

212
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,740
One is you should get rid of 90% of these regulations.

213
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,150
Their unbelievable number of permits and licenses, and this and that,

214
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,380
that you have to do to get anything done in China, most of them

215
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,600
are totally unnecessary.

216
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,930
There are certain regulations, obviously, that are necessary,

217
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,150
things regarding the environment and so on.

218
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,260
But then you want to make sure that whatever

219
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,170
you retain as a regulation is quite transparent.

220
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,150
And then you want to remove as much as possible

221
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:06,020
the discretion of the local official, as if a person meets the criteria.

222
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,170
So if you can do all those things, and it's very hard to do.

223
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,750
Because all these people that have these control of these levers,

224
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,170
they don't like to give it up.

225
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,770
In another country, which I'll leave unmentioned, where I have worked

226
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,040
and where we had a number of advisors, when

227
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,270
I was with the Harvard Institute of International Development.

228
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:33,240
The imports into the country required stamps of 70 different officials,

229
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,340
all of whom basically wanted a bribe, usually.

230
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,440
And it delayed things.

231
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,090
And it made essentially exporting manufacturers almost impossible.

232
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,720
And that country actually dealt with it for a while

233
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,920
by getting rid of the customer service, and bringing in a Swiss company

234
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,690
to run the customs.

235
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,520
That's politically very difficult to do.

236
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,110
And China's never--

237
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,525
There are not enough Swiss to run China's economy.

238
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:00,190
Well, they actually hired local people.

239
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,440
But it was-- the people running it was the Swiss company.

240
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,730
So in terms of advice I think getting rid of regulations will help,

241
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:18,580
making everything transparent, paying good salaries for people

242
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:27,570
in important positions based on their position and their performance,

243
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,300
firing them when they misbehave.

244
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,670
But China so far is mostly just dealing with the criminal prosecution

245
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,650
way of dealing with it.

246
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,730
And then I think working on the welfare system, steadily expanding it.

247
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,796
I mean China is slowing down.

248
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:48,670
But it's still growing at a fairly good clip.

249
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,130
And they're probably going to grow at a fairly good clip for another decade

250
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:59,810
or two, before it slows down to the levels of the more advanced countries.

251
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:06,110
Unfortunately the kinds of policies that could really radically change

252
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:12,840
the income distribution, massive taxation, highly progressive and so on.

253
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,410
I suspect at this time in Chinese history

254
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,740
it would probably seriously hurt growth.

255
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,860
The other big item I'd say is, sort of part of the welfare system,

256
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,680
is getting rid of the discriminatory aspects of the household registration

257
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,980
system.

258
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,220
Right now you still have a system where if you're

259
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,440
registered as being in the rural areas, even though you're in the urban areas,

260
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,270
you have difficulty getting access to schooling.

261
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,700
Theoretically, you have the right.

262
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,760
But in practice you have great difficulty doing it.

263
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,970
You don't have access to the healthcare system in the urban areas,

264
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,140
for the most part.

265
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,440
It's very difficult to get access to housing.

266
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,650
The housing is terrible for large numbers of these migrants.

267
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,700
All which is why they keep their children often back in the countryside.

268
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,740
That's something that doesn't make sense for the long term.

269
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,140
These children are not going to be working in the countrysides.

270
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,920
What is China going to look like?

271
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:17,870
What is Chinese economy-- think of it ahead in 2034, how do you describe it?

272
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,870
Assuming there is not some mammoth crisis of some kind, which would be

273
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,280
I think political in nature, and involving military.

274
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,200
And I don't think those are-- the military crisis, I think,

275
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,640
is not realistic.

276
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,970
The issues simply aren't there.

277
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,810
I mean you're not going to have a massive war over the South China Sea,

278
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,820
or the Diaoyutai Senkaku Islands.

279
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,062
I certainly hope not.

280
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:49,200
I mean it makes no sense at all.

281
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,580
We've had wars before that didn't make much sense.

282
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,530
Like World War I, for example.

283
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,880
But barring some major political upheaval that takes years to resolve,

284
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,750
which is as of now I don't think is terribly

285
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,079
realistic over the time-frame you're talking about.

286
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,424
Then you're talking about continued growth.

287
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:09,089


288
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:19,319
Per capita income at 4%, 5%, 6% a year maybe, a total GDP growth a bit,

289
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,099
half a point or a point faster.

290
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:25,050
You're basically going to be almost entirely urban society.

291
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,040
Less than 10% of the population will be in agriculture.

292
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,260
My guess is the state enterprises will have shrunk substantially further.

293
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,150
The size of the middle class, which people talk about as being huge,

294
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,990
and by comparison to most other countries it is in China.

295
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,850
But you're talking now 1.3 billion people, maybe 200 million, 300 million

296
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,530
you could consider in some sense, middle class.

297
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:56,010
You're going to have a much higher portion that are basically--

298
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,840
middle class in the Chinese context, a family that's

299
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,830
earning $20,000 a year is really doing quite well.

300
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,950
A family that is, an individual doing that is doing, especially well.

301
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,910
Then you have the big questions.

302
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,500
What kind of an automobile culture will it be?

303
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,210
And I don't know.

304
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,950
I mean I think they've backed off a little bit of their initial effort

305
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,970
to sort of get as many automobiles on the road as possible.

306
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,440
And they've built this transport infrastructure.

307
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,000
So the high-speed trains and all that are

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,490
going to make a lot of what we have in this country,

309
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,820
not so necessary in the Chinese case.

310
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:41,500
But if everybody wants an automobile, they'll figure out a way to get them.

311
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,130
And then the question of how the society will deal with 500 million automobiles

312
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,910
in a space that's a lot smaller than the US space,

313
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,230
in terms of where people actually live.

314
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,280
The welfare system will expand, and it'll look like a modern industrial--

315
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,850
and in fact China is already getting into the post-industrial.

316
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,190
The share of manufacturing in GDP is already declining.

317
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,610
It's moving toward a service economy.

318
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,310
So those are the economic things.

319
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,420
Of course, probably the most important thing

320
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,060
is what kind of political transitions are going to be.

321
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,950
And on that, I find it very difficult to believe

322
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,700
that they can go on for 20 years with a population

323
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,250
that is increasingly highly educated, and quite prosperous,

324
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,720
and run it the way they run it today.

325
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,660
Singapore can run a society sort of that way.

326
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,460
I mean it has real elections.

327
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,855
But it's run more like a corporation than a country.

328
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:49,080


329
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,350
I find it inconceivable that you could run a country of 1.4 billion

330
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:01,870
as it will certainly be or 1.5 billion, that way.

331
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,850
But they managed to do it for quite some time now.

332
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,370
And maybe they can do it for another 20 years.

333
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,710
I think there will be changes there.

334
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,976
But I would not venture a guess as to their nature.

335
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:18,960
Dwight, thank you very, very much.

336
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,550
My pleasure.

337
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,390
Dwight Perkins.

338
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,210
Thank you very, very much indeed.

339
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,360
Thank you all.

340
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:33,344
