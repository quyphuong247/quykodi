1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,410
BILL KIRBY: We're continuing our discussion of higher education

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:19,140
in China, the fastest growing system of higher education in quantity,

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,630
as well as in quality, in the world.

4
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,160
And I'm here with Professor Mary Brown Bullock.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:34,730
Mary is the executive vice chancellor of Duke Kunshan University.

6
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,220
She's a former president of Agnes Scott College,

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,760
and she's a very noted China scholar here in the United States.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,150
She is starting an altogether new university in China, Duke Kunshan

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,020
University.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,465
And Mary, tell us what it is and why you're doing it.

11
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:54,340
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: Bill, it's very exciting.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,490
You've been to Kunshan.

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,020
You know what an interesting city it is.

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,860
Starting a new university is really quite amazing.

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,069
We have three sponsors-- Duke University,

16
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,930
Kunshan City, and Wuhan University.

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,240
And we're literally starting the university from scratch.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,600
The buildings are coming up as we speak.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
There will be five buildings when we open,

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
and an entirely new curriculum and a new campus.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,760
The goal is to create a new model of a university for China, but perhaps also

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,319
for the rest of the world.

23
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,110
BILL KIRBY: So in what way would it be new?

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,610
In what way would it be distinctive?

25
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,291
Say, what might happen in Durham, or in Wuhan?

26
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,540
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: One of the things we're looking at

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,190
is whether you can create a new kind of curriculum that

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,120
is a global curriculum, that is really comparative and interdisciplinary.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,250
We aren't starting an undergraduate full curriculum yet.

30
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,550
But we're trying little modules of it, to see

31
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,700
what might work well with Chinese students, with international students,

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,530
and how one might really put together a new kind of university.

33
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,230
We don't have to have departments, Bill.

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,230
We don't have to have divisions or schools.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,170
We can really create also a new structure,

36
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,590
a new administrative structure, so everybody involved is

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,112
finding this pretty exciting.

38
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,570
BILL KIRBY: Well what kind of programs will you start with?

39
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,180
Obviously you can't start with everything in a brand new university.

40
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,630
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: We'll start with three master's degree programs.

41
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,340
These are Duke master's degree programs.

42
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,680
But each in its own way, I think, reflects a new era in education.

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,990
A masters of management science is not a traditional MBA.

44
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,760
This is a management and interdisciplinary management degree

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,070
that is designed to give liberal arts majors an opportunity to experiment,

46
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,960
to go into business, but without necessarily a business background.

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,100
We're also offering a master's in global health.

48
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,030
Global health is a new discipline.

49
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,850
It's more interdisciplinary, again, than public health.

50
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,680
It involves much more societal issues-- anthropology, economics.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,820
And, as you can tell by global health, it must involve all of the world.

52
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,690
So to site it in China where students and faculty have a chance

53
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,910
to see really the evolution of health issues in China gives it, I think,

54
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,230
a great location.

55
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,970
And the third degree is medical physics.

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,030
Medical physics is a combination, as you could say, of medicine and physics.

57
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,180
I didn't know what it was.

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,220
But we are aware of the science today that

59
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,270
looks at your body, that does radiology, CAT scans,

60
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,930
and that tries to-- is particularly important in cancer.

61
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,960
Cancer treatment, cancer detection, but other diseases, as well.

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,670
So this is the science that looks at how you use physics, and apply it

63
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,320
in a medical direction, particularly in the imaging world.

64
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,110
So that's a very different kind of degree.

65
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,860
But these three degrees, I think, suggest some of the directions

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,080
that Duke Kunshan will go.

67
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,770
There'll be a significant emphasis on medicine.

68
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,760
But medicine in a broader sense, not just a medical degree.

69
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,460
And then also looking at management, and we will move on from there

70
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,650
into other areas of social sciences.

71
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,260
BILL KIRBY: So I can see why this is surely

72
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,290
a great thing for Kunshan, which, to date, has not had a major university.

73
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,370
And I could see why a partnership with Wuhan and Duke

74
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,230
would be a very good thing for both universities,

75
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,980
and why these opportunities might be great for Chinese students

76
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,060
in different areas.

77
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,850
It's Dukes first really university abroad,

78
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,510
if one can think of it in that way.

79
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,800
So why, would you say, is Duke doing this?

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,300
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: Duke is doing it to give its students and its faculty,

81
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,150
and I would say, its staff, exposure to China, to learn more about China.

82
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,770
And I would say that it's already having a transformative effect at Duke

83
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,250
University.

84
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,570
So many Duke faculty have traveled to China, have been engaged in planning,

85
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,410
that they're now thinking, well, how might this play in China?

86
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,610
Or, how might we adapt this education for China?

87
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,250
So part of it is the very process of creating

88
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,930
a new university in a new setting, and trying

89
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,120
to learn something about the context, about the country.

90
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,000
But I think Duke has a larger ambition, which is to create a new curriculum,

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,830
as I mentioned.

92
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,930
Particularly in the liberal arts.

93
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,880
One that will try ideas and bring them back to the Durham campus.

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,400
For example, these would be undergraduate courses.

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,940
Perhaps even we would return to some required core courses that

96
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,550
are interdisciplinary, that are very comparative.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,380
And that would look at science and the humanities

98
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,660
together, in ways that we always talk about doing, but don't always do it.

99
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,440
So without formal structures, I believe that the faculty at Duke

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,570
hope that they can try something that'll be

101
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,730
useful and innovative for Chinese students,

102
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,360
but also for students from the United States.

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,350
BILL KIRBY: Mary, you're a historian of education

104
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,800
in an earlier period of Chinese history.

105
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,440
Mary has written the books on the history of Peking Union Medical

106
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,520
College, the great medical schools begun in the Republican period.

107
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,810
That was an era in which many international ventures took place

108
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,470
in China, with really quite dramatic aftereffects, and very positive ones,

109
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,030
institutionally.

110
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,310
How would you compare that period of Chinese foreign interaction

111
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,490
in the field of higher education with what's going on today?

112
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,031
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: Very interesting.

113
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,960
One big difference is that the Chinese are

114
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,010
inviting American institutions today.

115
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,630
These institutions-- Duke would be one of them,

116
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,340
but there are others, as well-- are part of China's design

117
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,260
to introduce some new models of education.

118
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,840
In the early Republican period, it was really Americans inviting themselves.

119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,430
Yes, they had sponsors in different places,

120
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,250
but there wasn't a kind of close collaboration

121
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,530
with a Ministry of Education, or provincial ministries at that time.

122
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,780
So I would say there's much more collaboration with a more, obviously,

123
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,550
mature Chinese educational structure.

124
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,520
And that is very important to the success of today's institutions.

125
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,260
Joint venture institutions will very much

126
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,610
depend on how that collaboration unfolds.

127
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,730
Given the success that you and I know about of the earlier

128
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,700
era of these standalone institutions, I think this augurs very well

129
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,290
for a new generation of institutions that are already

130
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,570
more effectively embedded in the Chinese educational structure.

131
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,890
BILL KIRBY: We're at an era right now in which many Chinese universities are

132
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,305
contemplating how they will reintroduce the liberal arts into their curriculum.

133
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,800
You have the Yuanpei program at Peking University.

134
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,930
You have Fudan College, at Fudan Universities.

135
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,235
It's liberal arts colleges within research universities.

136
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:05,120


137
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,480
DKU, Duke Kunshan University, is different in the sense

138
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,420
it's also a residential college outside of the city.

139
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,640
Like an American liberal arts college in New England

140
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,080
or in the Midwest, separated out from all

141
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,080
of the great pressures-- and great opportunities,

142
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,090
one might say-- but separated out from being

143
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,120
part of a major research university.

144
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,150
You'll have extensions of Duke's research mission, to be sure,

145
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,000
and Kunshan's and Wuhan's as well.

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,440
How do you imagine the residential life aspect?

147
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,160
Several thousand students, in time, living on a 200 acre campus

148
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,750
in a beautiful city of Kunshan.

149
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,260
How do you imagine this being different, for

150
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,112
both Chinese and international students who are there?

151
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:00,820
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: I like to think of it

152
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,130
as a Jeffersonian academic community.

153
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,100
You can know that wonderful quad, the lawn, the Jeffersonian lawn,

154
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,840
with the faculty residences on the side and interspersed

155
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,660
were scene living for students and then the academic buildings.

156
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,180
BILL KIRBY: So the University of Virginia?

157
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,138
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: The University of Virginia.

158
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:23,640
And DKU is going to have faculty housing right next to the student dormitory.

159
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,250
I know, because I'm going to be living in one of those faculty apartments.

160
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,130
They'll be shared places for eating meals together.

161
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,740
There'll be very much, I think, a commons in that sense.

162
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,400
So I'm hopeful that we will create a community in which faculty and students

163
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,050
do mix outside the classroom, and engage in social activities

164
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,390
or informal discussions, the kind of thing

165
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,440
that we really feel is the ideal, the beau ideal, of an academic community.

166
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,450
We won't be rushing off to the latest Shanghai restaurant, or something

167
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,830
like that.

168
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,700
That's going to take some nurturing.

169
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,690
I believe that-- I know Chinese students are ready for this.

170
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,570
They look forward to a time when they can really get to know their faculty.

171
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,110
And when faculty can help them, as mentors,

172
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,830
not just with this course or that course,

173
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,720
but with kind of planning the longer term life, the longer term career.

174
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,940
I also think we'll have visiting scholars and professors come

175
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,360
from other places.

176
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,660
And given the scale, I hope many people will go to the same functions,

177
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,960
so that one great speaker can really stimulate a campus wide discussion.

178
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,620
So those are just some ideas of how we might

179
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,080
try to create a really living intellectual community.

180
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,220
BILL KIRBY: You know, it's not easy being the founding president--

181
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,320
or co-president, because there's also Chancellor Liu from Wuhan.

182
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,580
But a founder of a new university.

183
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,310
John Harvard, is in some sense our founder,

184
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,980
but he actually never took part in actually running the university here

185
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,830
at Harvard.

186
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,890
There must've been, and must still be, some

187
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,070
challenges facing the start-up of an altogether new university.

188
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,480
What are some of the issues that you've had to deal with?

189
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: You know, some of the issues

190
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,620
really have to do with the structure.

191
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,730
The Chinese have a saying that even a sparrow has all of its parts.

192
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,500
So even though we start as a small institution, we have to have a library.

193
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,970
We certainly have to have a full scale IT system.

194
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,420
We have to have a dormitory, we have the student life programs.

195
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,670
And so we really want to make sure, even the first year,

196
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,540
we have all of the components.

197
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,840
So developing the infrastructure in the beginning

198
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,500
is certainly something I've been working on quite a bit this first year.

199
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,160
Another part, which we're just beginning,

200
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,090
is how do you put together the values and the principles

201
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,800
of this new community?

202
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,640
We draw on our heritage from Wuhan, and from Duke.

203
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,150
But we want the values also to embody a new institution.

204
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,580
So how do we do that?

205
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,050
We're spending some time thinking about that.

206
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,010
We will certainly adapt some of our founding institutions' values.

207
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,120
But my hope that is in the first year or two.

208
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,190
The first faculty, the first students, what fun.

209
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,550
They get to help, maybe write a school song.

210
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,350
But also think of what are the ethical values, and how to write about them.

211
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,820
How to talk about them.

212
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,035
So those are some of the really exciting things about a new institution.

213
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:30,160
You know, calendars are a problem.

214
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,010
The Chinese New Year's holiday that shifts every year.

215
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,480
How do you develop a calendar for a graduate and an undergraduate program?

216
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,700
These are just a few of the, you might say, more mundane things.

217
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,481
But they have to get resolved before we start.

218
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:45,730
BILL KIRBY: Do you have plans?

219
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,610
Duke is extremely well known in China as a great research university,

220
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,440
as a great undergraduate college, and, not

221
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,980
incidentally, for having one helluva basketball team.

222
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,239
Do you have plans for a DKU basketball team?

223
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,780
Is Coach K going to join the faculty?

224
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,220
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: There's already a basketball court

225
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,060
that's actually been put up on the construction site for people to use.

226
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,520
We don't have immediate plans for a basketball team,

227
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,650
but Coach K's already been to Kunshan.

228
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:19,370
And he brought a Duke basketball team for demonstration games.

229
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,240
We're now talking about Duke women's basketball,

230
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,650
bringing them for an exhibition.

231
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,742
And certainly, I'm sure, we will have soccer and basketball.

232
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:30,450
BILL KIRBY: Well maybe Duke and Harvard could play a game there--

233
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,776
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: Maybe so.

234
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:33,359
BILL KIRBY: --and we will do our best.

235
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:35,860
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: We'll see who wins.

236
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,250
BILL KIRBY: I will not dare make a prediction on that.

237
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,940
Mary Brown Bullock, thank you very, very much for joining us.

238
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,000
And we will all be, very shortly, in Kunshan to visit Duke Kunshan

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,470
University as it nears its completion.

240
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,760
Mary, thank you very much.

241
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,310
MARY BROWN BULLOCK: Thanks, Bill.

242
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,872
