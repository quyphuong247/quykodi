1
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:12,410
RUTH ANG: Yi ou lai Suzhou, OK?

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,070
So for those who speak in Chinese, there is a stress on our first character, yi.

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,066
Because yi ou lai Suzhou literally means brilliance from Europe.

4
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,960
It also means that when you come over here,

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,930
you feel very yi, meaning you look good.

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,185
There's a phrase that say shen cai yiyi, which

7
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:36,000
means you feel so elevated, so brilliant because of all the European products

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,690
that we sell, that you buy from here.

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,631
And also from the European hospitality that we're presenting to you,

10
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,630
and that you walk out of here saying you feel yi and you feel very free.

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,140
And that's what yi ou lai actually promises.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,920
And because this is a very interesting tour that you get from us,

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,130
wanting to know the Chinese consumer a little bit more, so I'll

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,660
spend a little bit more time to explain our name.

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,660
BILL KIRBY: Yes, please.

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,480
RUTH ANG: Our name is not formed of phonetic characters at all.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,980
It was actually based on linguistic truth,

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,230
so it is based exactly on the proposition of come and be yi.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,500
That was actually what the whole name means.

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,600
It's a rally cry.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,740
So the lai means come, let's do something together.

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,830
So we never use, in any of our characters,

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,360
to be actually phonetically different.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,490
Thank you.

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,020
So sweet.

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,470


27
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,285
So that's how the character goes.

28
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:34,615
Yi is the first one, lai.

29
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:37,980
So we say yi lai and then look at the yi ou lai.

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,620
So it's all the perspective.

31
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,637
So when you come over here, so that's our proposition.

32
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,720
And I think you know Value Retail relatively well.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,190
We've been famous in the last 20 years for creating experiential retail,

34
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,810
so this is not a surprise.

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,420
After 20 years, this is a tent baby, so to speak,

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,440
and the world, obviously, has marched on.

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,550
And you will see later that this particular product is anywhere

38
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,290
not less or more innovative, more creative,

39
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,565
and really answer to the same principle that has actually

40
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:10,669
made us so successful as a company.

41
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,240
And everything that we do is about servicing

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,510
that particular aspiring target audience.

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,320
The formula hasn't quite changed.

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,880
It's always been that we are situated in a place that's

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,900
almost like an hour and a little bit more as an escape

46
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,080
from the big metropolis.

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,810
And that's why right now in Suzhou and in the Suzhou area,

48
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,800
this little place here, is a big escape for some of the Suzhou people,

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,455
but mainly for Shanghai and also some of the big metropolises surrounding here,

50
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:40,670
like Nanjing and the other one, Hangzhou if you look at it.

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,070
So the only difference is that if Bicester Village has

52
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,525
one London next to it, Suzhou Village has

53
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:47,820
seven of that type of big metropolises around it.

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,150
BILL KIRBY: Yes, indeed.

55
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,010
I've never been to one of Value Retail's places in Europe.

56
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,020
And would I, for example, to go to one in Germany, would it

57
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,744
look-- so here we are in China.

58
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:09,494
And, of course, it looks European or Italianate--

59
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:10,478
RUTH ANG: For a reason.

60
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:15,040
BILL KIRBY: --for a good reason, because that's part of the idea.

61
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,275
I assume if I go to Germany it doesn't look Chinese.

62
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:17,816
RUTH ANG: No.

63
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:18,691
Totally not.

64
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:19,190
Totally not.

65
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,439
But it's a very good question.

66
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,390
And in order for us to create experiential retail,

67
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,640
we basically create a narrative, as a story.

68
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,800
We are big storytellers.

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,060
So we create a storytelling narrative for people

70
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,890
to come here on which it elevates their shopping experience.

71
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,950
So everyone can shop anywhere-- they can shop in a mall, any mall

72
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,750
that you mention.

73
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,330
They can even shop at home-- but there must be a reason

74
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,330
why people have to travel for more than one hour to come here,

75
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,040
to a destination that's different.

76
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,320
So basically, what it is is that we create a novelty.

77
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,180
We created a story that's based on the mentality of a tourist, of travel.

78
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,720
So when you go to Germany, the village that we use

79
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,370
is always based on authentic cultural and heritage vernacular of the region.

80
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,730
So it will be a village that's built of that.

81
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,700
Yes, it's Venetian architecture, but it's

82
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,690
because Marco Polo, on his last journey on the Silk Road, he came to Suzhou.

83
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,410
And that was the reason why.

84
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,529
But everything else, from the name to all the details on the architecture--

85
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,750
because I'll show you here quickly just now-- you will notice there's

86
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,590
a very strong Chinese interpretation of the Venetian architecture.

87
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,340
It's like people, the settlers, came here.

88
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,540
They stayed here, but there was a great celebration of the Chineseness.

89
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,860
Like, for example, beginning with our name,

90
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,660
and also beginning with our proximity to the temple that's

91
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,550
to the left of our lake, called Chongyang si.

92
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,600
Because yi is a very harmonious spirit.

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
It is about that spiritual feel, the brilliance.

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,100
It's about everything else, so it's not just

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,070
about global shopping that you look great and that's about it.

96
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,820
But it's always the Chinese that's looking

97
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,780
for that kind of self-identity that comes from inside out, also.

98
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,690
So we have a lot of thinking in how that water affects the building,

99
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,490
and everything else is built on the Chinese story.

100
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,110


101
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,732
BILL KIRBY: We're in Suzhou, long known as the Venice of the East.

102
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:19,350
Now, someday, when the Venice of the West has sunk under the waters,

103
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,720
Suzhou, we imagine, will still be here.

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,950
It's almost as if you're getting a grand tour of Europe,

105
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,820
but by staying here in China, inviting Europe to China.

106
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,080
And it is otherwise known as Suzhou Village, a tourism experience in China,

107
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,810
just opening now here in the spring of 2014.

108
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,940
I'm here with Ruth Ang, who's the director of marketing,

109
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,780
and with Nariko Vilante, who's the director of customer experience, which

110
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,240
we expect to be excellent.

111
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,710
NARIKO VILANTE: Yes.

112
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,540
BILL KIRBY: And we're surrounded by canals, recreated Venetian style

113
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:02,510
bridges, a wide range of shopping experiences in a Ouzhou shi,

114
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:08,020
kind of a Europeanesque center in the middle of Suzhou that

115
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,890
is one of the newest frontiers of China's consumer culture.

116
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,290
So, Ruth, can you explain to us a little bit more of what you were just saying?

117
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,500
What does this have to do with Marco Polo?

118
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,710
RUTH ANG: And his adventure on the Silk Road.

119
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,220
BILL KIRBY: That's right.

120
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,386
RUTH ANG: That's a good one.

121
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:24,410
Well, to begin with, everybody loves a story.

122
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,200
So instead of just building a village of beautiful buildings,

123
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,480
we decided to build a place that actually first, it gives people

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,790
a sense of place by creating a story.

125
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,250
So the story is always built on authentic history and culture.

126
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,610
And first thing first is that Marco Polo did come to Suzhou.

127
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,320
So we then used that story.

128
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,060
And he did come over here and actually discover,

129
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,110
and we've kept right here, a natural spring over there.

130
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,930
And then with the settlers and also with the beauty from the Yangcheng Lake,

131
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,080
he decided to settle down and then created the little settlement.

132
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,040
And based on that, we created this.

133
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,980
Then when he's here, there was a lot of merge

134
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,480
of the Chinese interpretation of the Venetian architecture.

135
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,750
So this whole village was built not just of Venetian itself.

136
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,760
But if you look from here, on the left, on his whole Silk Road journey

137
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,090
and mapping the Silk Road journey, he did go from Venice

138
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,840
all the way down to the Middle East, down here--

139
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,760
BILL KIRBY: There's Middle Eastern for the-- you'll see, otherwise,

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,926
Middle Eastern architecture.

141
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:27,590
RUTH ANG: And all the way down to a bit more east and then down to Asia.

142
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,530
OK, so you can see the changes of the architecture.

143
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,820
OK, you can see the minarets or the cupola actually changes.

144
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,620
It is a very different building, so you see all the architecture.

145
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,139
So the whole village is mapping his whole journey.

146
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,930
BILL KIRBY: And as you were saying earlier,

147
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,920
these buildings, which we shall see in a moment, are, in some sense,

148
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,580
what you might call contemporary Chinese interpretations of European

149
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,560
and Middle Eastern originals.

150
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,700
RUTH ANG: Yes, in some ways.

151
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,520
When you walk down the village, you can see the tiles over there,

152
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,370
on that building, on the second building.

153
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,834
And then you can see the third set of tiles there,

154
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:08,000
and then there's another set of tiles on the inside.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,610
These tiles are a visual identity of our silk knot logo.

156
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,450
If you look at our logo, you can see yi ou lai Suzhou,

157
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,490
and then there's an icon next to it.

158
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,080
And that icon, like here and here, that's the silk knot.

159
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,770
Now, this silk knot, as we also know, is a friendship and prosperity knot,

160
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,750
which you see on the buttons of the Chinese suit.

161
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,169
So because Shanghai itself is famous for silk,

162
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,014
so that's another reason why this icon represents this particular destination.

163
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:41,805
Now, back to the tiles, and the reason why I talked about the tiles

164
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:47,657
is because all the tiles that we see here are handmade by the Suzhou Shifu?

165
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,590
BILL KIRBY: Oh, wow.

166
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,900
RUTH ANG: So they built here, of course, this whole cul-de-sac that you look at

167
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,250
is almost a Venetian cul-de-sac you know, if I may say that.

168
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,720
So we've got a beautiful waterfront and then

169
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,370
you also see the Venetian bridges over here.

170
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,440
So this is a stage on which we present if Monet

171
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,010
can repaint because of the lights in these,

172
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,220
just like yi ou lai, yi decided to bring of Suzhou in a different manner.

173
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,130
So we created a so to speak cul-de-sac where people can see

174
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,350
and to be seen as they're walking a red carpet,

175
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,920
but also just like I love to do this, posing on this part of the bridge

176
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,980
like Dante found the muse, Beatrice.

177
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,800
And hopefully, our Chinese consumer will be here and able to see romance

178
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
and find their own muse on this whole parade.

179
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,060
You can see people sitting around and enjoying themselves.

180
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,520
And this, to me, is also epitomizing what

181
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,160
Chinese consumers are looking for now.

182
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,930
They don't just want such a literal product shopping experience,

183
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,030
they want the whole dimensional one.

184
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,270
And our positioning is why we say that we

185
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,340
are the first ever to bring a shopping tourism concept to China.

186
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,140
And the tourism concept is important to elevate the shopping experience.

187
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,640
Our Italian name is La Casa degli Artisti,

188
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,180
which is the home of the artist, for creative people

189
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,540
to come here to push innovation.

190
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,585
So we created a fashion platform because we sell fashion and retail,

191
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,640
but on that fashion platform we want to see

192
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,660
the intersection between art, culture, and fashion.

193
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,450
So you see designers in there, how they push

194
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,141
towards using art to present their work.

195
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,807
BILL KIRBY: Are these Chinese designers?

196
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:24,390
RUTH ANG: Yes.

197
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,440


198
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,980
BILL KIRBY: Right here in Suzhou, a center of very contemporary fashion--

199
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,450
a fashion the kind of which you're not actually going to find in Palm Springs

200
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,420
or on Rodeo Drive, but Chinese designers that are cutting edge.

201
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,167
Nariko, can you tell us a bit about Hu Sheguang?

202
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,000
NARIKO VILANTE: Yes.

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,700
So Hu Sheguang is a Chinese haute couture artist.

204
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,320
He lived and worked in Holland for a long time.

205
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,260
And this particular piece talks about women-- current women,

206
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,850
Chinese women, China.

207
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,430
So he has a passion of expressing how Chinese women feel.

208
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,530
He's talking about how they have burdens on their shoulders.

209
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,895
So as you can see, something very heavy here, something very heavy here,

210
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:13,841
et cetera.

211
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,370
He's very famous and he also made the dresses

212
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,520
for royal families, Dutch royal families.

213
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm sure that royal family's piece doesn't look like this,

214
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,240
but it's a beautiful piece.

215
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,090
BILL KIRBY: Thank you so much.

216
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:47,840
