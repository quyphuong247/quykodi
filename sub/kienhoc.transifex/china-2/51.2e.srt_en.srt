On Fugui

1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,240
Yu Hua, I want to talk about Fugui,

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,720
in the movie, in the novel, "To Live"

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,000
you have created one of the great characters of modern times.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,040
He's a young man who gambles in the 40s,

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,400
he's an artist, he's a performer, he's an actor,

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,280
he fights in the war of liberation,

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,240
first against the Communists with the Nationalists, then he turns.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,640
In the Great Leap Forward he loses his son

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,320
really to industrialization,

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,040
and in the Cultural Revolution he loses his daughter

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,840
because the Red Guard students

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
won't let a professional doctor care for her in childbirth.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,520
I want you to imagine Fugui in the market revolution today.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,080
What would he be doing?

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,560
What would he be suffering?

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,120
What would he be learning?

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,880
In my point of view, if Fugui lived until today

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:21,640
he must be a loser in this market transformation

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:31,800
because he is too honest, too kind

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:39,040
In a great transformation like marketization these days

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:50,120
if you don't want to do bad deeds you cannot be successful.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Where would Fugui be living today?

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,800
How is his wife?

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,920
What is he singing?

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,440
What is his mood?

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,000
If Fugui lived until today

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,520
I don't think he would live in his own home

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,840
because he would be a farmer who would have lost his land,

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,400
he would be living somewhere in a city

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,720
in a tiny apartment somewhere, very likely a forgotten derelict place

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,760
in a precarious urban space in China that has been forgotten.

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,000
Because I have observed in China in many of our cities we have a lot of abandoned houses

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,120
those houses that are unsafe for people to live

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,840
but actually a lot of people still live inside

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,720
they are not local people they are from rural area, migrants.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,920
I think Fugui would probably live in a place like that

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
However I do think that Fugui would make his place very clean, very tidy

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
Are he and his wife happy?

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,440
If he and his wife still live together

40
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,720
I think they will be happy.

41
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,000
But their destiny might not necessarily bring them together.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,880
Fugui reminds me a little bit of a

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,360
sort of a Chinese Charlie Chaplin.

44
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,400
He suffers, he's brave, he's wise, he doesn't say much,

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,720
but his heart is so, so big.

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,200
Where did you find the character?

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
And do you watch Charlie Chaplin movies?

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,240
Of course I watch films by Charlie Chaplin, yes.

49
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,120
He doesn't speak that much in his movies

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,400
only at the very end did he speak a few words.

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,760
Actually characters like Fugui are really prevalent in China,

52
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,080
they, of course this generation I don't know, like those of my little boy's generation maybe there isn't

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,600
When I was young, there were several people who lived in my alleyway

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,160
who were exactly like Fugui.

55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:57,640
They suffered a lot, they lived by themselves

56
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,000
but they still lived pretty well.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,480
So I think Fugui is a character

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,720
that can actually represent China of the past.

59
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,120
And what about the present and the future?

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,320
Because I thought Fugui comes off as indestructible.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,240
Is Fugui gone from the landscape?

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Yes I agree with you.

63
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,000
I do think Fugui will live on and on.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,680
He is such a kind of person that can live on through difficulty.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
He is full of life.

66
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,640
But did you say that your son does not know Fugui in his world?

67
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,120
Yes, maybe not now

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,920
but if the economic revolution goes on

69
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,760
the generation of my son may see people like Fugui emerging

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,440
because China has already gone through economic boom

71
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:55,720
and now we are actually shouldering the responsibility of this economic revolution.

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,440
So in the future, my son might know someone like Fugui.

73
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,920
Where will your son find Fugui in China in his lifetime?

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:12,720
Fugui can appear in any place, any time in China

75
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,200
in the future maybe my son will also become another Fugui.
