1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,732
BILL KIRBY: What did Duke worry about in this?

2
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:16,690
The financial thing isn't so great, by the way.

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,174
Kunshan is paying for the construction.

4
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:23,512
SPEAKER 2: Yale is more expensive -- Yale University of Singapore was more

5
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:26,720
expensive that it was originally thought to be.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
BILL KIRBY: Right.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,260
So what would you worry about?

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,180
Jasmine.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,480
JASMINE: This was mentioned in the Tsinghua case study,

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,580
but the government's intervention in higher education.

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,640
So Xi Jinping's movement towards more ideologically-based education.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,260
BILL KIRBY: OK, so that's a reputational risk

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,020
that everybody-- including us in our center in Shanghai-- has in China.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,860
If you're putting on a program and you cannot put on a program that is up

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,030
to your values, then why are you there?

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,730
So this hasn't happened yet in any of these places.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,552
Jill, yeah.

18
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:01,760
JILL: I was just wondering why they didn't like focus

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,713
on a school like MIT or Caltech, which would make a lot more sense with R

20
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:07,760
and D entrepreneurship.

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,000
Higher education in liberal arts-- there's

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,040
definitely unquantitative qualities to that,

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,600
and I don't know how much it would help Kunshan

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,050
because a lot of times you're thinking about leaders for the world.

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,819
Yeah.

26
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,610
You're thinking about leaders for the world

27
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,700
and thinking critically, which is helpful.

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,950
But if they're trying to make economic means,

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,266
wouldn't it make more sense to be doing directly technical classes?

30
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,140
BILL KIRBY: So here's a really good question.

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,210
How does this deal come about between Duke and Kunshan?

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,550
How many people at Duke do you think know anything

33
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,477
about Kunshan five years ago, six years ago?

34
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:45,850
JILL: None, if any.

35
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,780
BILL KIRBY: They know as much as you did a week ago, basically-- or less,

36
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,020
since you guys are serious scholars of China.

37
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,610


38
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,466
So how does a deal like this happen?

39
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,880
Alex, give me a hand.

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,719
ALEX: So they said that the former dean of Duke's Fuqua--

41
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,760
BILL KIRBY: Fuqua School.

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,370
Business.

43
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,537
Very famous business school.

44
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:08,453
ALEX: He was going around to different cities,

45
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:10,870
and then he met I think it was the Vice Mayor of Kunshan.

46
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,936
BILL KIRBY: Right.

47
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,060
Very entrepreneurial woman.

48
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,190
ALEX: And then they started working together

49
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,250
and ended up spearheading this project together

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,800
of creating the Duke-Kunshan partnership.

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
BILL KIRBY: OK, anything else we can gather?

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,840
Imagine reconstructing the story, Eric.

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,670
What do you think happened?

54
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,270
ERIC: Two-way street, so it makes a lot of sense for Kunshan,

55
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,780
but it also makes a lot of sense for Duke, as well.

56
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,510
Duke's trying to be a truly global university that can compete with

57
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,440
the likes of Harvard and Stanford, and to do that--

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,230
this is something revolutionary that basically hasn't been done since

59
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,030
Peking--

60
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,530
BILL KIRBY: The American universities were invested in China

61
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,931
before the revolution.

62
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:51,430
ERIC: Right.

63
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,305
So now for them, they're the first university

64
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:54,720
to go establish this presence.

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,380
If it takes off, then they're really in China.

66
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,690
Hopefully the next economic leader of the world probably in 30, 40 years,

67
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,899
so they're really making an investment in the future.

68
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:10,231
BILL KIRBY: OK, so you think it makes sense for Kunshan.

69
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,490
Obviously, the opportunity of getting a name like Duke

70
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,880
just doesn't come every day.

71
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,390
Derek?

72
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,391
DEREK: It makes sense because they're so dependent on foreign investment,

73
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,864
and especially Taiwan.

74
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:23,360
I think it's important that they hedge that in some way

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,090
by developing their own kind of innovations

76
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,747
so that they can invest themselves, because if something

77
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:33,080
were to happen to Taiwan for some reason that they don't want to invest anymore,

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,160
there's another low-cost producer elsewhere.

79
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,920
Then it might be--

80
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,980
BILL KIRBY: Taiwan, Vietnam, or Chongqing or somewhere.

81
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,160
They're investing.

82
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,490
They're making it easy for people to live in Taiwan.

83
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,360
Remember they have not just restaurants and tea houses, but schools and so on.

84
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,410
They're building actually now a subway to go from one part of Kunshan

85
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,440
directly to the Hongqiao Airport in Western part of Shanghai,

86
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,640
and you could be home in Taipei door-to-door in three hours.

87
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,420
It's pretty good.

88
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,975
Sanchin?

89
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:08,260
SACHIN: Maybe demand risk, in terms of not necessarily students from China,

90
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,760
but students from Duke in the US looking to go--

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,970
BILL KIRBY: Going over there.

92
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,089
So yes, will there be enough students to expand this, and enough high quality

93
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:18,870
students?

94
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,750
My guess is probably, yes, but you never know until students show up.

95
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,093
Harvard had how many students in its first class?

96
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:26,420
I think eight.

97
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,040
STUDENT: 16.

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,740
STUDENT: 12.

99
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,897
STUDENT: Maybe 12.

100
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:30,230
BILL KIRBY: Not a robust number.

101
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,465
Not one to give you confidence about the longevity of the institution.

102
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:37,810


103
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,960
So there is, of course, the risk that you'll get the students.

104
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,800
And of course then they have to have careers and placement

105
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,010
of a sort that distinguishes the institution.

106
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,025
All of that is in the future, and we don't know.

107
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:50,895
Sara?

108
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:54,070
SARA: I feel like there's still a little bit of political risk,

109
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,680
just because of the ties with Taiwan.

110
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,039
Looking forward, what if something happens between mainland and Taiwan?

111
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,830
BILL KIRBY: That's for sure a risk for Kunshan, generally speaking.

112
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,579
I don't think it'll be a big risk for DKU.

113
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,360
SARA: You don't think it would effect--

114
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,599
BILL KIRBY: Not really.

115
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,390
Its relationship to the Taiwan side, I think, is pretty tangential.

116
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,890
SARA: OK.

117
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,480
That's good.

118
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,313
EMMA: We were just talking about how they're

119
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,680
sort of both betting on the other side being something.

120
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,697
And Kunshan is betting on Duke being the big university,

121
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:22,780
and then Duke is betting on Kunshan being sort of the next Silicon Valley.

122
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,904
And if it doesn't become the center for innovation,

123
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:28,419
then it's just a university in this town that builds a lot of it.

124
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:29,960
BILL KIRBY: So it's very interesting.

125
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,085
You hit on a really important point, because the initial programs that Duke

126
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:40,200
has there are in global health, are in master of management studies.

127
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,856
And so health and business, and you'll see other very applied programs,

128
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,730
for instance starting with graduate programs.

129
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,150
But they're working very hard on starting two or three

130
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,020
years from now an undergraduate liberal arts

131
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,180
college, which is very much what Kunshan wants.

132
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,130
And the question is whether a liberal arts college will so immediately

133
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,780
deliver the kind of skills and intersections that you would want,

134
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,320
or will it end up creating people like you,

135
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,950
who are so highly critical and so difficult to deal with?

136
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,450
[LAUGHTER]

137
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,800
EMMA: So who is the university for?

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,450
Are they just American students going out there?

139
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,084
BILL KIRBY: No, it'll be 50% Chinese and 50% international.

140
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,060
EMMA: OK, wow.

141
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,393
BILL KIRBY: Including Americans.

142
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:19,560
EMMA: Cool.

143
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,210
BILL KIRBY: And I was out there in the beginning of the fall

144
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,020
to meet some of these students.

145
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,680
Starting very small with an extraordinary sense of commitment

146
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,730
on the part of faculty and students.

147
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,136
