1
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:13,500
I want to go back one step further.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Sure.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,060
He actually came back in July 1977, and he was put in charge of foreign policy

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,600
at that time.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,700
And he was also volunteering for taking over science, technology, education

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,860
after Mao's death in September '76.

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,360
Many people were thinking, look now, we can concentrate on modernization,

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,550
get rid of those terrible purges and the class warfare.

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,915
A lot of people were thinking.

10
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:46,000
And Deng was thinking, what do you need in order to get that started?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,680
So in August 1977, he was already beginning the formulations planning,

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,390
particularly to get normalization with the United States,

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,740
and to get a new treaty with Japan, so they

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,060
would move into close relations with Japan

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,489
so they could get the aid they needed for modernization.

16
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,990
Those are the two big places he wanted to work on.

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,130
In addition, he wanted to reopen universities.

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,790
And in '77, within two weeks of the time he came back to power,

19
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,706
he had all the leaders of science and education in the country at a meeting.

20
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:24,320
And at that meeting he says, can we reopen the universities,

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,850
and they said, oh it's so hard to do it, things are in such a mess.

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,100
He says is it possible, and they said, it is possible,

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,530
and he said we're going to do it.

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,840
And not only that, he did entrance examinations.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,280
Universities were essentially closed for 10 years.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,070
They were in a terrible mess.

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,260
And he said, we're going to reopen universities,

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,440
and we're going to have entrance exams.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,500
And in Mao's days entrance examinations meant plus political correctness,

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,410
or correct political class.

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,305
Deng said, we don't need political class anymore.

32
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:58,170
The landlord class is gone, the Bourgeois class is gone.

33
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,450
Anybody who passes the exams can go to the universities.

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,400
So he began entrance examinations based on merit.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,919
He wanted to produce the elite for the universities.

36
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,060
And he wanted to produce graduates who would take over

37
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,840
responsibility for leadership.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,840
And already in August '77 he was pushing forward on that program.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,380
But then he comes back to power and 78 when his colleagues

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,780
decided that Hua Guofeng who had been selected by Mao

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,740
wasn't quite up to the job.

42
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,810
And they put Deng in charge.

43
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,080
He already had a good base.

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,800
Universities were open, they had good relations

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,610
with Japan and the United States, just completed normalization

46
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,080
with the United States.

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,250
And so they were ready to announce gaige kaifang, reform and opening,

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,160
and they were ready to move abroad.

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,940
Nobody expected that one of the first things he'd do was retrenchment.

50
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,330
Because Hua Guofeng was so anxious to move ahead in '77, '78,

51
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,480
he made all kinds of contracts, and they didn't have the money to pay for it.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,890
So with the advice of Chen Yun, a conservative thoughtful economist,

53
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,375
Deng agreed right away in December '78, OK we'll slow it down,

54
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,000
we'll go back on some of the contracts.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,777
We'll get ready.

56
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:13,860
We don't want to be in a situation like we were in the Great Leap Forward,

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,620
trying to do too much too quick.

58
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,490
We'll get a solid base and then we'll throw the doors wide open,

59
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,640
we'll send as many people abroad as we can, we'll bring back all ideas.

60
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,790
He didn't look for a single model, he looked

61
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,740
for whatever worked in all spheres.

62
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,540
And so by early '79, they were planning to send all kinds of people abroad.

63
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,060
They were beginning to think about infrastructure,

64
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,640
they were beginning to get specialization,

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,150
rebuilding the academies and so forth, the Academy of Sciences,

66
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,980
and the new Academy of the Social Sciences.

67
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,100
And so he was in charge of that huge effort to move forward.

68
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,280
So in the 80s, Deng Xiaoping presides over

69
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,240
the decollectivization of agriculture, presides over

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,370
the growth of a flourishing still nominal state,

71
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,350
but flourishing increasingly private sector, TVEs in the countryside

72
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,100
and in the outskirts of major cities, agricultural production takes off,

73
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,390
foreign investment at least begins to come in.

74
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,110
How would you rate the overall success when you look at it in economic terms

75
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,120
and in political terms of the first decade of opening and reform?

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,470
It was extraordinary.

77
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,780
He really turned the place around.

78
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,140
In agriculture he was a brilliant leader.

79
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,280
He knew a lot of people wanted to keep collectivization,

80
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,670
and that if he had said that we're turning back on Mao,

81
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,490
people would not have been with him.

82
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,720
What he said was, in some of the poor mountainous areas, people are starving.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,930
We have to let them find their own way.

84
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,610
Even the right and left wings, most leftists could not oppose that.

85
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,820
They had to let people who are starving find a way.

86
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,770
Then a year or two later, he brings in reporters

87
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,750
who look at what they've done over that year.

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,910
And a lot of people let them have their own plots.

89
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,550
And they worked very well, and they reported that.

90
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,550
And then he made a statement that in special places where

91
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,200
people are starving, and the conditions are right,

92
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,730
and the local people want to do it, they should

93
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:21,430
be allowed to contract agriculture down to the household, which, in a sense,

94
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,240
allowed private farming.

95
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,320
Then once that get started, then you can let rural markets start, because people

96
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
on their own plot of land, they produced enough to meet their quotas to pass up,

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,450
they had a little extra which they can sell for markets.

98
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,270
So in two or three years, you had rural markets beginning to thrive.

99
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,160
And then you had those people from the rural areas say,

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,550
OK well let's start a little more industry.

101
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,140
And then they allowed what they called, Town and Village Enterprises, which

102
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,850
was really a way of saying in those rural areas, where

103
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,390
you had those markets, if people wanted to invest in little factories,

104
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,570
they could.

105
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,750
And they began to take off.

106
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,980
And then that rural economy was combined with what went on in the South

107
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,560
and the experimental area place called Shenzhen near Hong Kong

108
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,502
where they tried open markets quite widely.

109
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:16,210
And Deng was smart enough to know there are a lot of people there

110
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,625
who are close enough to Hong Kong they had relatives in Hong Kong who

111
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,105
wanted to make those markets work.

112
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:24,320
And a lot of smart Hong Kong business people

113
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,410
who were really willing to teach how you do things, how you organize and run

114
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,650
the little companies.

115
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,590
And so those experimental zones, the special economic zones

116
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,620
in Shenzhen particularly, worked extremely well,

117
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,250
and that began to take off.

118
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,842
And then Deng invited people from all over the country, leaderships

119
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:43,800
from all over the country, to go to those areas

120
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,850
and look at what was happening.

121
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,830
One of the things that China does well is

122
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,510
that when something works in one place, they bring in the officials

123
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,250
from other local areas and send people from the place

124
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,890
where it works to other areas, so you have

125
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,920
a rapid diffusion of new ideas at work.

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,990
And so by late in the 1980s, when they were letting these companies develop,

127
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,130
you had a private enterprise that was beginning to flourish.

128
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,800
Deng was smart enough that he didn't try to get rid of state enterprises

129
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,040
or put the pressure on them right away.

130
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,000
They had a lot of employment, and if they tried to do that,

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,050
they would have lost the political support.

132
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,310
But he left those state enterprises until the late '80s

133
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,960
when the private enterprises began to grow,

134
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,090
they could absorb more employment.

135
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,990
And then he began to allow pressure on the big state enterprises

136
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,680
if they didn't compete.

137
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,460
Then gradually, they too should be allowed to go out of business

138
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,770
and let the struggling enterprises that compete better to take over.

139
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,790
So he had set the country on a growth rate.

140
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,090
In 1978 when he started, I don't remember any westerner

141
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,970
who looked at China who thought that a communist country could grow faster

142
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,630
than a capitalist country, particularly over a period of awhile.

143
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,180
And here for three decades they were growing at about 10% a year on average.

144
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,200
And he got that started, and by the time he left it was going strong.

145
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,130
So it was really, of course, they weren't rich at the end of the 80s.

146
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,710
Things had to develop slowly, and when you're in extreme poverty,

147
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,260
increasing 5%, 8% a year, that's a lot, but it

148
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,170
doesn't compare when you have a much bigger base.

149
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,960
But it was an extraordinary turnaround.

150
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,974
