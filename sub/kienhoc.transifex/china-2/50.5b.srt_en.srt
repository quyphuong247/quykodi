00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,440
The Three Gorges Dam is surely one of China's most visible investments

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,510
in renewable energy, aimed to provide enough energy to meet

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,240
10% of China's demand for electricity.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,060
Critics, however, charge that the dam has

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,590
brought with it many environmental challenges.

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,890
Opening this $28 billion project in 2003 required the flooding

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,670
of 13 cities, 140 towns, 1,350 villages, and a total

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:46,720
of 400 square miles of land, displacing 1.2 million people from their homes.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,560
Among the land that was drowned for the purposes of creating

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,210
the dam's massive reservoir were agricultural lands and hundreds

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,640
of ancient archaeological sites.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,570
Moreover, due to the high concentration of upstream urban and industrial

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,260
centers, the main reservoir of the dam threatens

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,930
to become a cesspool of chemical pollutants and garbage

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,570
on top of the 25 million tons of sewage already being dumped into the Yangzi

16
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,550
every year.

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,490
In addition to concerns that have risen about landslides and general soil

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,320
erosion because of the growth of this large reservoir,

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,840
the dam, which is 2,300 meters wide and 185 meters high,

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,380
sits on several fault lines.

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,520
And some critics have suggested that the dam itself

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,130
could trigger an earthquake in its immediate proximity, which

23
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,065
includes several cities with over a million inhabitants.

24
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:48,010


25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,330
Another project even more ambitious than the Three Gorges Dam

26
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,130
is the South-North Water Transfer Project.

27
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,450
In 2013, the Chinese government launched the South-North Water Transfer Project,

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:06,190
a $62 billion project to divert 50 billion cubic tons of water

29
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,870
from the Yangzi River to that dry North China plain.

30
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,570
350,000 people have already been relocated for this project.

31
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,410
How else can Beijing maintain itself as a capital 20, 30 years from now?

32
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,390
And yet experts, global and Chinese, anticipate

33
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,730
certainly some negative environmental impacts perhaps worse

34
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,520
than those of the Three Gorges Dam.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,350
They may include a dramatic decline in the volume of Yangzi River water

36
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,800
and the growing salinization of Yangzi River water.

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,900
People worry that much of the water to be diverted to the north

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,670
is itself already polluted.

39
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:57,260
And what happens when that Tibetan snow cap, the source of the Yangzi River,

40
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,250
finally melts?

41
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,515
