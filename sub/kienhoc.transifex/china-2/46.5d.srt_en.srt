00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,360
So we're here again at the enormous CP Farm just south of Hangzhou Bay,

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,280
and there's big wheat fields behind me.

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,270
This is a place that grows two crops of wheat a year from about October

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,730
through to May.

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,310
This is shortly going to be harvested, and then it will be paddy rice.

6
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,810
How did this get to be here in a place that

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,930
wasn't growing anything just a short time ago?

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:43,840
Let's go over and take a look at this description of this particular field.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,890
A year ago, this was swampland of a kind that you

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,320
can see here, on the edge of Hangzhou Bay, not farmable.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,450
Then it was restored, as it were, roads built in between, drained.

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,190
The soil turned over to desalinate it.

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,390
Then, upon the completion of its preparation,

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,180
you see the beginning of planting.

15
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,760
And here we have the wheat that didn't exist,

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,600
in a wheat field that didn't exist, even a year ago.

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,750
Mr. Wang of the CP Group who oversees the planting of wheat here.

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,130
