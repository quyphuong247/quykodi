00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,367


3
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:18,780
In the CP farm, an enormous 20 kilometer-long farm off Hangzhou Bay,

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,670
this is just one of the districts-- the Greenhouse District--

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,740
in which greenhouses stretch as far as the eye can see.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,020
This is just one part of what you might call

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,310
this "industrial agricultural park"-- part of a fundamentally profound change

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,290
in the scope and scale of Chinese agriculture.

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,600
This is Mr. Tang.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,660
Mr. Tang is the Vice Director of this greenhouse project.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,970
This is Mr. Zhuang, and he is responsible for the production

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,660
and planning section.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,420
Here, we'll introduce some basic knowledge about this greenhouse.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,870
This greenhouse is called a "32-type" kind of greenhouse.

15
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,530
It's not that technically advanced, but it

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,840
has a advantage of being cheap enough to be widely applied by the local farmers

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,540
here.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,080
The cost of building of this kind of greenhouse

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,700
is about 100 yuan per square meters.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,230
The product we have here won't cost more than 2 yuan per 500 grams.

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,650
So in this way, we can reduce the price of the agricultural products

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,320
here to allow more and more common people

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,175
to enjoy the great advantage of technology.

24
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:32,690
Technically, the first step that we have been trying to do here

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,790
is to test the productivity of the barren, salty line here.

26
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,270
And by applying a kind of technology called "wutu zaipei"--

27
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,530
that is, "plantation without soil"-- this kind of technology

28
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,510
they use is called "wuxian shengzhang"-- "unlimited growth"--

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,110
which means they won't control, like, how long

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,300
or how tall this plant will grow.

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,210
They will let it keep growing, which means

32
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,010
that it will enlengthen the seasons of the growth.

33
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,030
So that, for instance, starting from every February and to December,

34
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,300
this plant will keep growing, and that also

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,850
means that they will have a relatively long period

36
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,740
to have harvest of the product.

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,910
So it will reduce the cost.

38
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,600
In terms of their selections of the kind of vegetables or fruits

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,790
that they grow here, take the tomatoes as example here.

40
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,230
They selected a kind of tomato that has been tested having high productivity.

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,360
There was a quite strict selection process.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,610
An equally important aspect that the CP Group has been paying attention to

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,890
is how to maintain the environmental or ecological balance, which

44
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,340
means they will use organic fertilizers and they will make sure, on one hand,

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,860
the agricultural products are organic and that, on the other hand,

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,480
the soil they keep using for growing those products

47
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,130
can maintain its fertility and not pollute it.

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,970
This whole process is a non-damaging process.

49
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,950
And the first important step is to isolate the plant

50
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,340
from the outside environment, and then they

51
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,130
choose a kind of fertilizer that is organic

52
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,180
that won't leave any chemical traces in the soil.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,690
The second process is to apply a biological control in terms

54
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,000
of the insecticides to prevent insect damages, and what they do

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,090
is they will choose certain kinds of parasites

56
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,160
and let them kill the other insects that are their natural enemies in order

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,400
to prevent the plant from the damage of the chemical insecticides.

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,930
Another very important process is that the company

59
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,340
will print a certain trace mark on the package of each product

60
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,660
and then digitize the information of those products and to make sure

61
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,780
that each product is traceable.

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,300
And so for instance, after you buy a package of tomatoes,

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,270
you know where it is from.

64
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,480
You know where it was originally produced and which piece of the land it

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,780
is from to make sure that customers will understand,

66
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,270
to be sure that the products are safe.

67
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,500
All of those processes that we mentioned are

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,470
based on one principle-- that is, the company wants

69
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,550
all the people around China to enjoy good food,

70
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,000
safe food with a cheaper price.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,360
Since the CP Group established its Cixi Project, the plan has been carried out,

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,000
but only some part of it has been realized.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,610
But this also means that there are more work for us to do,

74
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,440
and our goal is to create a complete systematic agricultural production that

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,640
has featured itself the CP agricultural ideals and principles.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,460
We're in the greenhouse for cucumbers, and I

77
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,530
can tell you that these are really good cucumbers.

78
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,770
Again, they're organically grown.

79
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,640
They have biological controls for pests.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,940
A little cucumber like this takes only 10 to 15 days

81
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,080
to grow into a big cucumber like that.

82
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,950
The interesting part of this is that you have these plants down here.

83
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,260
They're let down, and then you have them grow back up.

84
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,990
So 10 months out of the year, they're producing cucumbers.

85
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,170
And these are really good cucumbers.

86
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,110
But the production rate per mu, which is around 1/6 of an acre,

87
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,630
is really quite extraordinary

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,360

89
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,860
[yiwan siqian jin]

90
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,475
7,000 kilograms a year from 1/6 of an acre

91
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:47,700
of these wonderful, wonderful cucumbers.

92
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,656
