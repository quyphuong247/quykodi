1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,140
Animal feed.

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,359


3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:12,859
Animals.

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:14,338
Animals were raised.

5
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:15,820
Livestock.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,027
Livestock, sure.

7
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:18,610
Anything else?

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,300


9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:19,800
Feed.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,299
Silk.

11
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:22,120
Silk export.

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,050
Silk for internal and export markets.

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,550
So sericulture is part of it.

14
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,110
Remember tea?

15
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,650
The biggest export commodity in the world at the turn of the 18th

16
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,340
to the 19th century.

17
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,320
So it's a highly commercialized countryside, too.

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,770
It's not just subsistence farming.

19
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,130
It's really quite different.

20
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,230
And it's part of global markets in many, many commodities.

21
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,770
And, of course, handicrafts.

22
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,766
Small industries.

23
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:54,350
The making of clothes and so on.

24
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,210
So there's a lot going on.

25
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,940
And yet I think the perception-- and certainly

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,950
the 20th century perception, not just Communists,

27
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,250
but also Nationalists, Western observers--

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,570
is that it's a system in crisis.

29
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,931
