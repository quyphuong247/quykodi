1
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:12,331
You'll raise a lot more chickens.

2
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:15,080
You'll raise a lot more chickens, but you only have so much space.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,436
What can you do?

4
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:17,710
You only have so much capital.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,755
What can you do?

6
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:21,720
How does it work?

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,150
And why would you want to work with these Thais?

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,045
You may not know that they're Thai, actually.

9
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:29,550
You've been watching their TV show, like one,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,780
and so you think they're-- what's in it for you to work with them?

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:43,470
First of all, one thing that they offer is insurance for local workers

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,040
because the government doesn't offer the farmers

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,620
insurance whereas CP Group does.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,780
I guess there is benefit to four more chickens.

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,900
Even if you don't have room for it, you may still benefit from it.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,610
If you work with them, you'll get better feed, ideally, for your chickens.

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,464
What else might you get from them you might have to rent from them

18
00:01:07,464 --> 00:01:09,301
or be part of, do you imagine?

19
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:09,800
Robert?

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,220
Don't they help broker loans between farmers and financial institutions

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,700
They can broker and get money.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,080
So you want to have a lot more chickens.

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,740
You can't just keep them upstairs.

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,930
You might want to build a coop for them.

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,140
Johnny?

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,312
Won't they end up buying the livestock in the end?

27
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:30,020
So in the end, won't they buy the livestock that they help raise?

28
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,250
Indeed.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,310
You had a market from them so you're not so dependent.

30
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,410
If you have a contractual arrangement with CP, you can invest in more,

31
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,330
but you can at least have a good sense that you

32
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,480
don't have to just go to the open market and take your chickens down

33
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,790
to a local market.

34
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,627
You can raise them and CP will come and pick them up

35
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:49,960
and you'll never see them again.

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,460
Johnathan?

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,290
Along those lines, CP shields the farmers from market fluctuations.

38
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,730
It guarantees the farmers a 12% return, so it's

39
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,710
a very stable form of agriculture.

40
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,980
Is 12% a high return on agriculture, do you think?

41
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,780
Reasonably high.

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,150
I think historically, if you look at the growth

43
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,150
rate of any agricultural economy, particularly China, 1% to 2% to 3%.

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,360
3% is really high.

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,180
12% is extraordinary.

46
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,160
Certainly not in the history of the People's Republic has this happened.

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,610
Then what happens to this chicken?

48
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,590
We've got the chicken.

49
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,700
Kevin has raised more chickens.

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,880
Now Jake has managed to buy them from him, and then Julie,

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:40,054
they go to your supermarket, to Lotus Supermarket that you're the manager of.

52
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:41,345
Who owns the Lotus Supermarket?

53
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:44,670


54
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,290
CP also.

55
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,015
Yeah, CP owns it.

56
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,890
And in fact, in the Super Brand Mall, there's

57
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,390
a huge Lotus Supermarket underneath.

58
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,330


59
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,930
Have they already gone through inspection or is it at this point?

60
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,230
What do you think?

61
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,260
Before I sell it.

62
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,540
Before you sell it, would you rather have them,

63
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,335
or do you inspect them after you sell?

64
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:07,380


65
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,960
So presumably, the science of the agronomy

66
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,320
is taken care of at the farm on its way to the fork, but not any post mortem.

67
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,160


68
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,830
Anything else we need to know about this?

69
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,112
It's an extraordinary thing.

70
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:27,570
It's really an extraordinary thing.

71
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,020
Jake?

72
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,728
It has massive distribution channels that

73
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:33,740
connect all the way to international markets like the US and Europe.

74
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,560
Right.

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,790
Do any of you eat shrimp?

76
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,168
How many of you eat shrimp?

77
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:41,080


78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,840
I don't think this is in the case.

79
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,650
Half of the shrimp consumed in this country

80
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,540
is grown by the CP Group in Thailand, in Southeast Asia, and in China.

81
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,680
Now, these dragons, what's the largest dragon,

82
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,400
that is, in these integrated supply chains, that is mentioned in the case?

83
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,210


84
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,180
Johnathan?

85
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,280
There are six of them but the largest is in Beijing.

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,399
There are six that are mentioned in the case and the largest is in Beijing.

87
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,500
Hanling, let me ask you.

88
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,820
Is there a national integrated supply chain here?

89
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,920


90
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,860
Does CP have, basically, is it now bigger than the state?

91
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,900
Does it run Chinese agriculture?

92
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,578
Are they integrated throughout the whole country, do you think?

93
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,130
I believe so.

94
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,000
You don't think so.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Joy?

96
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,388
What do you think?

97
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:45,350
I think they do.

98
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,850
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,425
Is it nationally integrated?

100
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:49,305
Probably not.

101
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:51,754
Why not?

102
00:04:51,754 --> 00:05:02,322
Because they don't have access to that many areas.

103
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,780
They have access to a lot of areas.

104
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,755
They're active in 30 provinces.

105
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,280


106
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
I think that's in there somewhere.

107
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,910
So they are active nationally.

108
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,880
So is it a national company, or how are they organized?

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,072
What are these supply chains called, Eric?

110
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:24,590
They're organized regionally to reflect the industry based on geography.

111
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,840
I'm thinking maybe they would have too much monopolistic power if they could

112
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,230
just do it once, or there would be some problems with getting everything

113
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,090
together, but they have their regional supply chains.

114
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,890
So that is actually a big point to think about.

115
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,540
China is investing hugely in national infrastructure

116
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,390
but in fact doesn't yet have the national infrastructure

117
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,690
for a national food market.

118
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,740
Everything is done at the provincial or regional levels.

119
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,840
You remember the discussion, I think, under Professor Bol of macro regions?

120
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,640
Never think of China as one market.

121
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,700
Think of China as a series of huge regional markets, and in this case

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,110
a series of separate provincial markets, because if they

123
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,150
want to make these arrangements, whom do they

124
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,150
have to make these arrangements with?

125
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,120
Just with farmers?

126
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,550
Can they go do whatever they want with farmers?

127
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,300
Who else do they have to talk to if they want to work successfully

128
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,680
in agriculture and agribusiness in China?

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,342
Jasmine?

130
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:29,050
Who would you have to talk to if you want

131
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,870
to set up one of these vertically integrated chains?

132
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,500
The government.

133
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,971
What government?

134
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:36,212
The Chinese government.

135
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,170
The Chinese government.

136
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,470
No, the Japanese government.

137
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,952
That would be mistaken.

138
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:43,160
But which Chinese government?

139
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,760


140
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,820
The communist government.

141
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,861
The communist government.

142
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:49,207
Anybody?

143
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:50,540
That's not what I'm looking for.

144
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,994
Chas?

145
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:52,910
The local governments.

146
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,210
Yeah, local governments.

147
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,080
There is no national market for eggs.

148
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,870
There's no national market for chicken.

149
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,740
There's no national market for pork.

150
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,620
China consumes 70% of the world's pork, and until about five years ago,

151
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,740
one out of every four trucks between Nanjing and Shanghai

152
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,810
was full of pigs, live pigs.

153
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,710
People like pork fresher in China than they do here,

154
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,360
but they also can't get it fresher safely over the long distances.

155
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,360
China remains a provincialized economy in agriculture.

156
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,690
There are only a few truly national goods.

157
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,180
They have these series of regions.

158
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,880
They have to do business separately 30 different ways,

159
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,520
30 different party secretaries of 30 different provinces in many towns

160
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,430
along the way, and this is the cost of doing business in a big way in China

161
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,090
because you're doing business in 30 European countries

162
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,550
as well as nationally.

163
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,680
I was going to say that that's a core aspect of their business models

164
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,140
to have early entry into a developing country

165
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,210
and then develop a relationship with the local government,

166
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,510
and then as it develops, people gain more money

167
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,980
and then they have more desire to buy these proteins,

168
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,180
and then they're the ones who are in charge of selling them.

169
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,680
Will?

170
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,460


171
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,930
Was it CP or someone else?

172
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,760
What Chinese company was it who bought, is it Smithson, the big US pork

173
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,001
producer?

174
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:18,500
No.

175
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,330


176
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,020
Shuanghui.

177
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,268
That's right.

178
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:25,510
It's not them.

179
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,420
It's not them.

180
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,130
It's not them.

181
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,966
I had dinner with that guy a couple weeks ago, a lovely dinner

182
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:37,210
and it wasn't pork, but it was a lovely dinner.

183
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,299
What do you think?

184
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,039
Is this a successful company?

185
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,040
It's unbelievably successful, and it's successful

186
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,900
because it's enriching itself, it's enriching farmers.

187
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,260
Is it well connected politically?

188
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,400
Investor number 001, Deng Xiaoping, not bad.

189
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,730


190
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,150
What do you think their big challenge today is?

191
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,672
