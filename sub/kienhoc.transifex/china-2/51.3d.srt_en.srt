Literary Influences

1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,520
Your works in the last almost thirty years

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,680
have often been compared to the works of some famous western authors.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,080
Mr. Mo Yan's works have been constantly cited

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,480
as a Chinese answer to Western masterpieces

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,680
as demonstrated by writers such as William Faulkner

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,480
or Gabriel Garcia Marquez

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,200
Magical realism and so on and so forth

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
I would really like to ask you

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,680
What literary connections would you draw between Faulkner and Marquez

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,560
and your own interpretation of the Chinese "native-soil" literary tradition?

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,000
from your own self-reflective perspective?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,920
What is different or similar from the western traditions in comparison to your own works?

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,440
I must acknowledge those western writers you just mentioned, whether Faulkner or Marquez

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,880
they most certainly have influenced me.

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,000
In fact I venture to say that for my generation of writers, the Chinese writers of the 1980s

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,080
we were all heavily influenced by these writers

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
It is also only with this backdrop that we have the "root-seeking" literary movement

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,520
Everyone wanted to deny it, right?

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,680
In 1987, I wrote an article called "Two Blast Furnaces: Garcia Marquez and William Faulkner"

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,440
A small article published in World Literature, No. 3 (1986), pp. 298-299)

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,360
At that time I already felt,

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,600
following behind the backs of Marquez and Faulkner

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,000
copying their each step was meaningless.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,320
We must leave them.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,160
How do you say? They are two burning blast furnaces

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,000
and we are icecubes.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
if we stand too close we will evaporate.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,640
We can only survive if we stay farther away from them.

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,200
But they really did open our eyes.

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
Before we had never been exposed to this sort of writing.

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
Before the 1980s, during the Cultural Revolution

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
there may have been a yellow covered version

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,320
for internal reading within the party,

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,240
we rural children would never have access to read it.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,160
Only until after 1980

36
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,360
As soon as we read it, my gosh! it was like

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,160
when Marquez read Kafka for the first time.

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,760
It is said that when Marquz read Kafka's Metamorphous

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,920
he pounded the table, exclaiming "Wow! Novels can be written like this?"

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,280
When we read Faulkner and Marquez, it was the same sort of feeling

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh! So this is how one should write a novel!

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So they have already written like this!

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,320
We can write like this too.

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,560
So then we started.

45
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,840
But after realizing that copying was no path to take,

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,880
I think we immediately started looking to our own history, our own culture,

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,840
to our own personal experiences to find inspiration.

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
At this time I think, what really inspired me a

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,600
cemented the style of my works would have to be Pu Songling

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,840
in the tradtion of his Strange Tales from Liaozhai (also translated as Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio)

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
I feel I left Marquez's tradition far behind.

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,200
Including Life and Death are Wearing Me in reality was paying tribute to Strange Tales from Liaozhai

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,440
In the beginning the character Ximen Nao

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,480
Is in hell pacing back and forth in pain

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,520
like "The Cricket" (Xi Fangping) in Strange Tales of Liaozhai

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,800
Of course I think some people see the reference, some people do not see the reference.

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,920
So I think "native-soil" literature, oral folktales

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,360
Strange Tales  of Liaozhai, this sort of tradition

59
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,880
decided the basic style of my novels

60
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:49,160
But in these last couple years, I have said before, that I am constantly wrestling with Marquez

61
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,200
I just want to leave him

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,120
but Marquez—I have said he is just like an addiction

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,320
Once you appreciate him, it's impossible to break addiction

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,840
without even noticing you have sidled up to him.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,880
I constantly want to leave him

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,240
I think by Life and Death are Wearing Me, I finally left him

67
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,720
Of course there are people who disagree, they still see me copying him

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,280
There is nothing I can do about that.

69
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,240
Right.

70
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:20,760
From our perspective as a reader, Life and Death are Wearing Me definitely is a turning point

71
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,840
You have taken Chinese traditions and incorporated them into your style

72
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,920
This really is a touching piece of work.
