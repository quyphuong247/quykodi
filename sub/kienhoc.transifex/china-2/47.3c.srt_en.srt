1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,070
You remember where Zhejiang is?

2
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,360
Southeast?

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,900
Mm-hm.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,400
Mm-hm.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,180
Rose-ann?

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,270
I'm wondering if it's because of its geographical location.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,310
It's still kind of far from the capital.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,810
OK.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,930
It's not in Beijing.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,460
That actually helps, at this moment in time, perhaps, to do the kind of things

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,930
that Mr. Lu did.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,130
And it's, indeed, far from Beijing.

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,375
Where is Chiang Kai-Shek from?

14
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,130
South China.

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,983
South China.

16
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:37,910


17
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,090
Actually, the movement came from Guangdong, but he's from Zhejiang.

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,790
Chiang Kai-Shek's from Zhejiang.

19
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,900
And, indeed, most of the national leadership, activist leadership

20
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,430
from the 1920s through the 1930s after the founding of the Guomin zhengfu

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,480
is from Zhejiang.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,870
Or the National government.

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:00,535
It's the home base, as it were, of the enemy.

24
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,980
Because Zhejiang Province is traditionally

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,414
the most entrepreneurial area

26
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:05,914
Exactly.

27
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:07,381
--in China.

28
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:10,804
So historically there are a lot of entrepreneurs.

29
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:15,449
And also, I guess, local governments are somewhat flexible in the way

30
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:17,650
that they deal with some stuff.

31
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,110
So Zhejiang is a historically entrepreneurial area.

32
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,382
It's an area with a lot of SOEs that would compete with them.

33
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:25,750
I don't think so.

34
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,270
There's virtually none.

35
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,060
So if there's no big local SOE auto parts manufacturer or something

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,490
that would be a competitor for state resources or state attention.

37
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,630
So they have an open field if they can somehow get themselves into the state.

38
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,032


39
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:43,865
What about Hangzhou?

40
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:47,280


41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,710
You guys heard of Hangzhou?

42
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,330
Yes.

43
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,070
Is this a upstart town with no history?

44
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,660
It's the capital.

45
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,690
Capital of?

46
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,190
Zhejiang.

47
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,760
Yes, but?

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,720


49
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,350
If you look.

50
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,360
Look at this.

51
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,540
These are the names of some of the most entrepreneurial cities

52
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,270
and towns in all of China, and, indeed, in all of Asia.

53
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,110
Hangzhou is the capital of this.

54
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,510
It's the capital, of course, of the southern Song.

55
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,670
We'll go ahead again.

56
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,034
It is today recognized as the number one business city in China.

57
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,950
And when I asked Mr. Lu-- and you'll see this quote a little bit later

58
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,100
on-- what's the secret of your success, Mr. Lu?

59
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,780
He thanks the government.

60
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,860
Because the government-- really, the same government

61
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,905
would have arrested him if it really knew

62
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:41,530
what he was doing when he was starting.

63
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,400
Or at least it might well have.

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,650
But instead, I asked him, what's the real secret of your success, Mr. Lu?

65
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,560
And he says, as long as there is a human race, there will be Chinese.

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,200
As long as there is a market, you will have people from Zhejiang.

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,260
This is the genetic explanation of his success, and historical one as well.

68
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,700
So now we've done this.

69
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,839
How big is this company?

70
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,630
Small, big, medium?

71
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,360


72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,780
In its market?

73
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,280
Large?

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,700
Huge!

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,000
Not large, huge.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,520
Now it has about a 65% market share in auto parts in the biggest automobile

77
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,160
market thing in the company.

78
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,620
So bigger than it is in your case.

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,170
Twice the size in your case.

80
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,920
Who owns it today?

81
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,660


82
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,320
Who owns this company founded in a people's commune in 1969?

83
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,540
Who owns Wanxiang?

84
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,130
What kind of company is it?

85
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,420
It's private, indeed.

86
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,060
It still seems to be in the family.

87
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,780
Family.

88
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,640
Family company.

89
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,830
Really extraordinary.

90
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,200
The question that I had when I was thinking of writing this case was

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,086
was this really a family company all along-- in the worst period of Maoism

92
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:15,540
to have a family company-- but disguised in a people's commune?

93
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,980
Or did Mr. Lu, Russian-style, steal the assets in the 1990s

94
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,040
when it became formally private?

95
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,890
I never, of course, had the courage to ask Mr. Lu this question.

96
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,160
But the answer, I think, is 100% clear.

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,570
He didn't steal the assets.

98
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,970
It was his company and his family's company, protected by a very wise party

99
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,280
secretary so that this village could thrive.

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,430
And so it had a name, a socialist name, but, in fact,

101
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,140
it was a private family enterprise all along,

102
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,030
and became formally so again in the 1990s.

103
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,780
Its focus, we've seen, historically is clear.

104
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,350


105
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,920
And we've seen what its strategy has been.

106
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,320
What Mr. Lu's fundamental strategy?

107
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,896
