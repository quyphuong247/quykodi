00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:07,541


3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:13,190
We are finally at Hangzhou Bay, at this enormous agricultural farm

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,780
of the CP Group.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,940
Hangzhou Bay in back of us.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,920
The tide is out.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,180
It's all mud flats right now.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,690
But when it'll come in, it'll come in to a height of about one and a half meter.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,790
Far out there-- it looks pretty close, it's three kilometers away--

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,470
is the beginning of a seawall-- the next set of dikes,

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,690
as it were-- in the process of reclaiming parts of Hangzhou Bay back

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,980
for agriculture or for, in this case, for the first time,

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,590
in the case of agriculture.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,280
Once again, this is the highly-modernized, highly-mechanized

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,760
operation, but what's happening here isn't altogether new in history.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,040
Is it Peter?

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,630
Well, no.

18
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:59,390
I mean, to begin with that dike that's emerging there in the distance,

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,920
that dike is the 12th dike.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,629
We're standing-- or the camera that's looking at us

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,370
is standing on the 11th dike.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,340
And that means, going all the way back behind the camera,

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,720
there are a whole series of dikes going back to the number 1 dike.

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,390
That number 1 dike was built probably in the Song dynasty, perhaps even earlier.

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,090
And so every time, they extended this out-- and the process

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,310
is called "poldering," and the way it works is you cut off-- you

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,420
basically make a seawall.

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,150
You let water start to drain out, and you dredge earth in,

29
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,871
which is one of the reasons why this land is all so salty.

30
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:44,370
Right?

31
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,890
Because basically, it's land from the sea,

32
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,580
and that's how they've extended this territory out.

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,255
Now, in recent times, this had still been all marsh

34
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:56,170
and hadn't been developed yet.

35
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,980
Eventually-- and the methods of developing it were known.

36
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,480
Right?

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,740
It would take several years to do it, and what this CP Group did

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,220
was figure out how to do it very quickly-- within a year--

39
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,229
to make it productive land.

40
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,850
But it's not-- we know that this was going on 800, 900 years

41
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,040
ago here along Zhejiang, in this northern part of Zhejiang.

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,323
Also, along the Jiangsu coast.

43
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:19,460
Right.

44
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,870
And in fact, it's not unique to China.

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,410
Much of Holland, for example, is lower than sea level.

46
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,822
It's land has been built out with dikes, and that's still going on today.

47
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:30,322
Right.

48
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:35,270
And you know, this place looks a little bit like Holland

49
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,460
as we're reclaiming this sea and we're surrounded by windmills.

50
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:39,960
Yeah.

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,070
So let's take a look at that because we have the windmills-- what

52
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,080
are called fengche in Chinese-- and those windows are generating, I think,

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,960
something like 1,500 watts an hour from that.

54
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,200
But you use the word "reclaiming" from the sea.

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,150
I think what it's really doing is claiming from the sea.

56
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,480
Well, when one thinks about it, here we were

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,680
told that we'd come back in another 10 years.

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,210
We'll have two or three further dikes out.

59
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,195
Maybe we come back and another 30 or 40 years, we'll be in Shanghai.

60
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,031
[LAUGHING]

61
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:15,530
Wow.

62
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:15,830
OK.

63
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,430
All right.

64
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,630


65
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,480
Thank you.

66
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,051
