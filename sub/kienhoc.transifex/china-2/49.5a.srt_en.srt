1
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,460
BILL KIRBY: All right.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,935
So now, Duke is building a campus in Kunshan.

3
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,410
Let's get to what Kunshan wants.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:27,565
Do they want to revisit the great glories of the time of Gu Yanwu

5
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:29,900
and to bring back their success.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,540
Now, instead of the old exams, it'll be the gaokao that distinguishes them.

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,520
Rose-Ann?

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,050
ROSE-ANN: So they basically wanted to build Kunshan as a cultural center

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,239
as much as it was--

10
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,530
BILL KIRBY: So you're talking about Kunshan government?

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,990
ROSE-ANN: Leaders in Kunshan.

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,310
BILL KIRBY: Yeah.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:47,620
OK.

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,940
So, Kunshan political leaders.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,070
ROSE-ANN: Yeah, and what they realized was that they really

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,510
wanted a system that emphasized liberal arts as well as the sciences.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,370
BILL KIRBY: OK.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,740
Well that's a very good question.

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:08,154
If have your aim up here to build-- you have an economic development zone,

20
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,320
you have an economic and technical development zone,

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,610
a special economic zone.

22
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,140
You're doing high-tech stuff.

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,160
Would your first thought be to import a place that's extraordinarily well known

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,730
for the liberal arts?

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,360
It might be.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,180
I mean I'm a huge believer in the liberal arts.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,680
Emma?

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,100
EMMA: Comparing it to Stanford in Silicon Valley.

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,850
BILL KIRBY: Right.

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,120
EMMA: And Stanford has its liberal arts requirements and whatever,

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,344
but it's largely focused on innovation and I

32
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:40,064
think they don't want them trying to do just a place that's

33
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:43,314
producing a lot of electronics but rather creating,

34
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:46,230
so they have this whole move to say, instead of saying made in Kunshan

35
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,563
they can say created in Kunshan.

36
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:51,620
They want it to be a center for innovation as well as production.

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,370
BILL KIRBY: Right.

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,570
From made in Kunshan to created in Kunshan.

39
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,430
EMMA: I think the idea is having a university there

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,210
that's focused on technical innovation will--

41
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,730
BILL KIRBY: Boston has the so-called Innovation District.

42
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,230
Right?

43
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,759
The seaport district, and so this is to be part of Kunshan's Innovation

44
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,650
District to take development to the next stage.

45
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,480
Zach?

46
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
ZACH: I think, especially, Duke is particularly well-positioned

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,620
to help them do that because, if you look Duke's history as a university,

48
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,150
it's been seriously increasing rankings the past 20 years.

49
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,680
I think it's poised right now where it's starting

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,382
to gain-- it's essentially Ivy League.

51
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,090
BILL KIRBY: Sure.

52
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,140
EMMA: It's still looking to move further and I think now a lot of universities

53
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,040
are recognizing that the best way to track even better students is

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,280
to take a more innovative approach, focus more

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,439
on Silicon Valley-type teaching.

56
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,980
BILL KIRBY: So that's-- so you're saying that it makes sense,

57
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,450
from Kunshan's strategy.

58
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,140
ZACH: Duke is a perfect university.

59
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,290
For example, they're probably not going to be able to attract Harvard.

60
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,310
BILL KIRBY: Why not?

61
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,000
ZACH: They're just too well--

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,765
BILL KIRBY: You think they kan bu qi wo.

63
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,830
You think they don't like us?

64
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,886
ZACH: We're already so much established, whereas Duke is still

65
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:01,940
in the early stages of development in terms

66
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,110
of becoming internationally renowned.

67
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,610
Nationally, it's already done it but internationally-

68
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,600
Duke is in the perfect position.

69
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,330
BILL KIRBY: OK.

70
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,420
And you think-- let's just pause on this one.

71
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,050
So we have-- it makes sense for Duke.

72
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,239
Anyone else want to come in at it from Duke's strategic point of view?

73
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,155
MICHAEL: Well I think I'm from North Carolina.

74
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm a little familiar with Duke's history

75
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,190
in that it's first international student to come to Duke was from China.

76
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,940
BILL KIRBY: Right.

77
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,064
MICHAEL: In the late 1800s.

78
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:33,810
So their engagement with China, I think, is pretty unique.

79
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,870
And regardless of if they want to expand to Kunshan or Beijing or Shanghai.

80
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,653
I think having Chinese presence makes sense for Duke, given

81
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,830
their history of national engagement with China.

82
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,690
BILL KIRBY: OK.

83
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,980
Sarah?

84
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,240
SARAH: In addition, I think that, with the Taiwanese investors,

85
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,044
there's a stronger focus on the standard of this education

86
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:53,960
and so I think that they're setting themselves

87
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,210
more to be at this international standard, which

88
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,072
makes them more appealing.

89
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,280
BILL KIRBY: So they really want a top-ranked partner.

90
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,905
SARAH: Exactly.

91
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:03,656
BILL KIRBY: Not a middle-ranked partner.

92
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:04,155
Adriann?

93
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:05,090
ADRIANN: I was going to go off what Michael said.

94
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,407
It was Charlie Soong who was--

95
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:07,490
BILL KIRBY: Charlie Soong.

96
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,050
You ever heard the name Soong?

97
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,801
ADRIANN: Many times, and he was actually friends with Sun Yat-sen.

98
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,508
BILL KIRBY: Sure.

99
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,660
ADRIANN: So, the legacy that he left in China,

100
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,710
whether good or bad-- looking back at history.

101
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,209
The fact that he was so involved with the major changes that

102
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,917
occurred in China, I think, was something

103
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,240
that attracted the Duke, and--

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,370
BILL KIRBY: This is the father of-- this is the father-in-law.

105
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,330
Effectively, Sun Yat-sen Chiang Kai-shek...

106
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:27,955
ADRIANN: Right.

107
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:30,699
So, I think that now-- we consider your book, right?

108
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,740
Is China going to take advantage of 21st century?

109
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,264
I think Duke wants to be right in this mix.

110
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,930
Creating this campus where their, essentially, top students will

111
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,010
be there, may be more effective for them.

112
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,030
