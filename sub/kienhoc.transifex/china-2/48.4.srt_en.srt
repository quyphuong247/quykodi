1
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:12,990
WILLIAM KIRBY: We're here in the Tsinghua School of Economics

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,896
and Management, the Tsinghua Jingji Guanli

3
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:19,140
Xueyuan, which I think is almost without question

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,570
the single most difficult school to get into in the world-- much harder

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,000
to get into than Harvard or Yale or Stanford.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,040
And I'm here with one of its leading faculty members, Professor David Li.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,882
David was the member of the entering class of Tsinghua Jingji Guanli

8
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:49,700
Xueyuan in 1981 of 31 students who began this extraordinary school.

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:56,730
He came to the United States to study in 1985 as a visiting scholar,

10
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,190
was talked into getting a doctorate at Harvard, for which we're very, very

11
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,610
grateful, and received his doctorate in economics

12
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,570
under Dwight Perkins and other colleagues in 1992.

13
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,210
And then went on to an extraordinary career as an economist,

14
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:24,040
and as a professor at Michigan, at the Hong Kong University

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,320
of Science and Technology, and now at Tsinghua,

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,650
where he is the Mansfield Freeman Professor of Economics,

17
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,560
where he is the Director of the Center for the Study of China in the World

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,860
Economy, and where he is to be the announced

19
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,540
director of the new Schwarzman Scholars Program at Tsinghua University.

20
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,840
So David, it's a great pleasure to be here, to talk with you,

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,400
and to talk before our students at Harvard and around the world.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,200
So let me start with one question.

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,790
You have this incredible career and great list of accomplishments.

24
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,790
You could have a position in any university

25
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,729
that you wished in the world.

26
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,780
Why did you come back to China?

27
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,780
DAVID LI: First of all, my honor and my pleasure

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,650
to have this opportunity to talk to you and through you to our students.

29
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,150
I hope some of them will become Schwarzman Scholars in a few years

30
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,220
when our program formally starts.

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,710
Well, you ask a wonderful question-- why I came back to my alma mater, to China.

32
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,070
I'm an economist.

33
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,440
And for the economist, I think, the most exciting thing

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,430
is economic development, economic changes, or institutional changes.

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,490
And in our time, I think the most exciting economic events

36
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,000
are happening in this part of the world, in China.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,450
Meanwhile, I still find it quite frustrating, oftentimes,

38
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,280
when I talk to my American economist colleagues, some of them

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,350
even at Harvard.

40
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,010
Because when my American colleagues talk about economics,

41
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,595
they usually talk about economics of America.

42
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:16,700
When they talk about the economy, they talk about the US economy.

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,350
When they talk about economic mechanisms,

44
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,040
they talk about the American economic mechanisms.

45
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,480
Well, things are very different outside the US.

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,580
So I find it more exciting, more interesting

47
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,910
to stay here in this part of the world for me

48
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,400
to really watch, and think about, and discuss, and teach, and do research

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,450
about actual economic happenings, which are not the same as those in the US.

50
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,500
WILLIAM KIRBY: The lack of commitment or capacity,

51
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,790
particularly of economics departments, to engage

52
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,430
in people who also have deep regional expertise-- the language and research

53
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,280
capacity to understand an economy that is not that of the United States

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,870
or of Western Europe, that is not one of the most developed economies

55
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,330
or historically well-developed economies.

56
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,399
And most of them are actually very good at studying the United States,

57
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,529
but they assume that the lessons of the American economy matter for everyone.

58
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,140
I'm not convinced that's true.

59
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,689
But I am convinced that it's a shame for us

60
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,230
that you have left the United States.

61
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,410
But it is great for Tsinghua and great for China.

62
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:38,050
Tell me a bit, if you wouldn't mind, about the Center for China

63
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,650
in the World Economy, and tell me about the kind of work

64
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,940
that you're doing here.

65
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,570
DAVID LI: At the Center for China in the World Economy,

66
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,070
what we're doing are three things.

67
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,340
First, we do our research.

68
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,130
We promote research on the Chinese economy, especially the interactions

69
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,820
of the Chinese economy with the rest of the world.

70
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,070
For example, just one example, the internationalization

71
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,260
of the Chinese currency, renminbi, which is, to me, very exciting, very new.

72
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,900
Because if you look at past historical experiences of internationalization

73
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,380
of national currency, you can talk about the US dollar,

74
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,290
you can talk about the German Deutsche Mark, you can talk about Japanese yen.

75
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,270
But each case-- sterling pound, of course-- each case

76
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,700
is very different from the others.

77
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:39,410
And so in front of us, we are observing really world level impactful changes

78
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,320
in the internationalization of Renminbi.

79
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,120
And there are many, many, many academic, economic issues

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,570
as well as policy issues involved.

81
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,470
So that's the first thing we do, research.

82
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,650
The second thing we do is events.

83
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,130
We organize many, many interesting events.

84
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,200
For example, every three months, every quarter,

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,710
we organize a public forum, a Davos-style public forum.

86
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,180
Well, what is Davos style?

87
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,840
Davos-style forum is that of speeches.

88
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,330
We invite people to have conversations, panel discussions, conversations

89
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,710
in front of a large audience.

90
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:24,630
So every quarter, I personally moderate a panel, usually consisting

91
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:31,020
of seven or ten panelists, who are international scholars, reporters

92
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,080
from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times,

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,030
as well as Chinese economists, and sometimes Chinese officials.

94
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,430
And we have very dynamic, very interesting exchanges

95
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:51,400
of views in front of 300 or sometimes 500 very intensely interested

96
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:58,130
audience of students and reporters from outside the campus.

97
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,000
So that's the second thing we do, events.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,180
The third thing we do is publication.

99
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,470
So we do publish a quarterly journal which we call China And World Affairs.

100
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,000
Let me show you one version.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,230
This publication is internal.

102
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,660
It's not meant to be purchased.

103
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,090
With the internal publication, we have freedom.

104
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,490
We can say many things.

105
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,730
We are very free in saying many things, including political reforms, including

106
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,040
economic reforms, including US-China relations.

107
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,230
And we do send these issues, these copies,

108
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,180
to various mail stops in Zhongnanhai-- in other words, the Chinese White

109
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,410
House.

110
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,100
So the senior officials do have a chance to read this.

111
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,580
And these are very intense discussions.

112
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,490
And actually, Professor Kirby, let me invite you to write for us.

113
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,550
WILLIAM KIRBY: I would be honored.

114
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,710
DAVID LI: Please write something controversial.

115
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,087
Write something which can provoke the thinking of senior officials in China.

116
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,420
So that's the third thing we do.

117
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,560
Three things-- research, events, and publication.

118
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,180
WILLIAM KIRBY: You're a busy man, extraordinarily accomplished.

119
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Your advice is sought the world over on not just

120
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,300
where China's economy is going, but where the world economy is

121
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,090
going in relationship to China and what China has to do with the world economy,

122
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,920
but also in all kinds of major economic issues.

123
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Now you've agreed-- and it's a wonderful thing--

124
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,510
to be the founding director of the Schwarzman Scholars Program

125
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,659
here at Tsinghua University.

126
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,100
Why are you doing that?

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,380
DAVID LI: Again, wonderful question.

128
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,620
I think I'm already at a stage of my career and my life for me

129
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:57,500
to really think what I can expect to do in the coming 10 or 20 years.

130
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,990
So one thing is to continue publishing, continue doing things I've been doing,

131
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,390
which is exciting, which is interesting to me.

132
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,170
However, at the same time, I think living in China, I'm used to the idea

133
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,800
that we have to change.

134
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,860
We have to innovate.

135
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,730
We have to do reforms.

136
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,680
Even with our personal lives, we have to keep on changing.

137
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,020
Repeating doing the same thing for the coming 10 or 20 years

138
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,060
may not be the most exciting thing in this time of changes in China.

139
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,490
In fact, it's a whole world of changing.

140
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,780
So about six months ago, when Steve Schwarzman--

141
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,960
a successful business leader in New York--

142
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,780
approached me to invite me to join the team of the Schwarzman Scholar Program,

143
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,960
I instantly felt very excited.

144
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,400
And I feel excited that through working in this program,

145
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:02,140
I can reach out to the brightest and the best minds among young people,

146
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,810
not only in China, but those in the US and in other parts of the world,

147
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,200
and also working with leading scholars like you.

148
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,720
You are the chairman of our Academic Advisory Council.

149
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,320
Working with you as a team, we can help shape the future world's leadership.

150
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,840
We can work together to make sure our kids

151
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,330
and our grandkids do understand each other.

152
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,870
And when they become leaders of their own communities--

153
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,600
whether they are president of the US, or prime ministers of the UK,

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,020
or Chinese presidents-- they understand each other.

155
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,700
They understand each other's culture.

156
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,760
They understand China.

157
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,210
They understand also personally, they have their own personal friendship

158
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,710
which they enjoy for their whole life.

159
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,840
And then when we achieve this, the world, I'm sure,

160
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,490
will be more peaceful than today.

161
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,600
To me, this is a much better use of my time and energy

162
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,040
than continue writing articles, which I will try to do also.

163
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,070
WILLIAM KIRBY: Which my guess is that you will try to do anyway.

164
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,330
Let me ask you, if you look at the world--

165
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,820
and this is a question I'm going to ask our students here--

166
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,070
the world of universities in the last three centuries,

167
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,290
arguably German universities led the 19th century,

168
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,530
certainly European universities broadly conceived.

169
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,640
American universities came to a position of global leadership

170
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,690
in many areas in the second half of the 20th century.

171
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,670
What are the prospects from your point of view?

172
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,730
Because this an issue that I'm currently researching, and I need to learn.

173
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,820
What are the prospects from your point of view of Chinese universities--

174
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,130
Tsinghua, for example-- of leading the world,

175
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,060
setting global standards in the 21st century?

176
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,790
DAVID LI: This is really a wonderful question, also a very thought-provoking

177
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,160
question.

178
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:10,070
To me, a university like Tsinghua can make two kinds of contributions

179
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,350
to the world of education.

180
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,670
First, Tsinghua University, I'm sure will

181
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:25,070
make some progress in the area of natural sciences-- physics,

182
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:33,420
biology, chemistry, so on and so forth, because of the relative scale,

183
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,620
because of relative cost effectiveness.

184
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,070
Frankly speaking-- I'm going to be very frank-- in doing natural science,

185
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,980
you do need man power.

186
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,920
Size sometimes matters.

187
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,170
In the large team of lab workers, it's very labor intense.

188
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,860
And in China, we do have that.

189
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,770
In China, for example, in our labs, in our biology labs,

190
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,160
we're going to have 200 independent labs.

191
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,300
And each of them will have, on average, a larger size of lab workers

192
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,460
than Harvard.

193
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,660
I know Harvard relatively well.

194
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,730
So this is one area I think Tsinghua will make progress.

195
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,400
Now, whether Tsinghua will be able to compete with universities like Harvard,

196
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,230
MIT in this area, I'm not fully sure.

197
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,350
But I'm confident that Tsinghua will make progress.

198
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:41,440
Tsinghua will be a good collaborator, will be a good and honest competitor

199
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,470
with Harvard, with MIT in this regard.

200
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,270
So in this area, I'm confident Tsinghua as well as the whole of China

201
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,640
will make progress.

202
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,560
Another area I think that's even more exciting to me

203
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,240
in which University of Tsinghua can make progress

204
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:09,610
is that we are based in a different institutional setting in economics

205
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,770
and in politics.

206
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,310
And also, our society is so much larger.

207
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,280
Our cities are so much larger, so much more complex than New York, Chicago,

208
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,930
than Boston.

209
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,930
So China is facing lots of social problems, social management

210
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,200
problems, institutional problems.

211
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:38,150
So naturally, we are forced to think differently from American colleagues.

212
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,370
And again, I'm being very frank.

213
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,580
Not that we are more creative, but we are forced.

214
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,080
We have no alternatives.

215
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,860
If we follow the American logic in energy management,

216
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,880
in traffic management, in communication, we

217
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,790
are going to bankrupt the whole world.

218
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,300
So we are forced to innovate.

219
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,760
It's not because the Chinese are more innovative.

220
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,910
We are forced.

221
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,790
So in this area, in the social science area,

222
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,070
I think Tsinghua will be able to make some contribution,

223
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:18,800
to provide some alternative thinking to the mainstream thinking in the US

224
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,960
or in the Western world.

225
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,500
So these are the two areas I think Tsinghua may make contributions.

226
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,020


227
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,000
WILLIAM KIRBY: So you think 2050, the Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings, Tsinghua

228
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,760
number one, Harvard number five?

229
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,750
DAVID LI: I wouldn't say that.

230
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,200
Harvard is my alma mater.

231
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,360
I am grateful to Harvard.

232
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,750
I still want to see Harvard as number one in the world.

233
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,610
I'm being honest.

234
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,720
And also, I do hope that Tsinghua will be ranked in the first echelon,

235
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,560
in the first team in the community of higher universities in the world.

236
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,710
Feichang ganxie David.

237
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,190
Thank you.

238
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,240
Talking with Professor David Li of Tsinghua University

239
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,030
School of Economics and Management.

240
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,080
Ganxie, thank you.

241
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,630
Terrific.

242
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:18,752
