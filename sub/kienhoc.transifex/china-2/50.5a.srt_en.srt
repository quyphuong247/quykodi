00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,060
Chinese government, which is very aware of the domestic and international

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,120
implications of environmental policy, has

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,150
acted to address environmental concerns.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,960
Its development projects have targeted specific environmental goals,

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,940
such as the production of renewable energy and increasing access to water.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,090
Sometimes, however, these projects' objectives

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,010
have had environmental costs of their own.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,730
Certain short-term effects to clean up the environment,

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,300
such as the preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympics,

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,400
indeed achieved remarkable success.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,460
Looking to the longer term, the government

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,150
has also implemented broader policy approaches

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,880
to protect China's environment.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,350
We can think of several recent projects and policies

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,680
which have both advantages and costs.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,558
