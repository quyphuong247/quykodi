00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,605


3
00:00:08,605 --> 00:00:11,990
Owing to Qing regulations on migration to Taiwan,

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,310
very few Chinese settlers migrated to Taiwan

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,700
during the first century and a half of Qing rule.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,090
And most of these migrants were men, as women were legally

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,050
forbidden to migrate at that time.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,250
As a consequence, there were numerous marriages between Chinese migrants

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,780
and aboriginal women, and a population of part-Chinese,

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,090
part-aboriginal began to emerge.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,560
In the 19th century, the Qing changed policy and encouraged immigration

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,450
to Taiwan by the latter part of the 19th century,

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,370
because it began to see Taiwan as an increasingly

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,550
integral part of the empire, and it was worried about Japan's ambitions

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,950
toward Taiwan.

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,630
In 1885, the Qing made Taiwan a province in its own right,

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,650
and it dispatched to Taiwan a governor who

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,110
engaged in a series of modernizing efforts,

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,800
including the construction of the first railroad on Taiwan.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,610
In 1895, the Qing was defeated by Japan in the Sino-Japanese War

21
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,400
and forced to relinquish Taiwan as war booty.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,340
Taiwan then became Japan's first colony, and Taiwan

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,980
remained part of the Japanese Empire until the end of the Pacific War

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,510
in 1945.

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,890
Taiwan's elite, who had been educated in the Chinese system,

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,550
and who saw themselves as subject of the Qing,

27
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,490
initially resisted the Japanese takeover.

28
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,500
They even went so far as to declare Taiwan's independence from the Qing

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,890
in order to establish a Taiwan republic, in the hope

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,320
of thwarting the Japanese claims of sovereignty.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,130
This didn't work.

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,070
Japanese power was overwhelming.

33
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,120
And by the second and third decades of Japanese rule,

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,930
Taiwan's inhabitants increasingly became assimilated

35
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,230
as subjects of the Japanese Empire.

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,150
The Japanese imperial government promoted

37
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,490
agricultural and industrial development.

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,640
It improved transportation and communication.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,030
It implemented a system of public education that was carried out,

40
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,230
of course, in Japanese.

41
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,940
By the time of World War II, many young Taiwanese

42
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,610
thought of themselves, as they had been taught,

43
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,510
as citizens of the Japanese Empire.

44
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,320
Those who fought in the Pacific War did so almost exclusively

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,220
on the Japanese side.

46
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,730
However, the militaristic and authoritarian character

47
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,380
of Japanese rule led also to some resistance in the late '30s and '40s

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,670
in the form of a small movement to seek Taiwan's autonomy.

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:43,904
