China's Future

1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,360
Yu Hua, you write like a free spirit,

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,800
you have the face of an honest man,

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,640
is this a dangerous way to live in China?

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,520
Or do we exaggerate that?

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,960
Does the government threaten you

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,720
for your best qualities as an artist?

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,920
I was not very clear about this thing

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,400
I have not discovered that my freedom has not been violated by the government.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,160
There used to be a New York Times journalist in China

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,200
who cautiously reminded me

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,080
that he or she had very sure information that I

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,880
was under surveillance by the Chinese government.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,480
Afterward I became very careful about everything,

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,920
I looked over my shoulder every time I walked

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
to see if anybody was following me

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,720
however I never saw anyone following me

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:15,360
so as far as I know I'm not under

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,720
government surveillance in China.

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,320
However I know Mr. Ai Weiwei

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,000
is under government surveillance

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,040
and there is an interesting story.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,560
I own an apartment in the same building

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,120
as Mr. Ai Weiwei in Beijing.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,560
One day I walked down the stairs

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,160
Suddenly I see Ai coming out of his door with a guy

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,960
so I came up to him and say hello

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,520
and I thought that might be his friend

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,960
and I was chatting with him

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,580
about how are things going these days

30
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,200
he responded "Isn't it always the same? I'm pretty much the same as before"

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,240
I then said "is the government bothering you these days?"

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,000
He hemmed and hawed and said "Let's speak about that later, let's speak about that later."

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,120
It was only after he left that I realized that was not his friend

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,080
it was an officer from the national security bureau, who was following him.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,360
Was he worried or did he laugh about it?

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,000
I think he's worried about me,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,640
he doesn't worry about himself,

38
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,000
he worries that I will also be involved in it

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,080
My last question,

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,080
the Chinese government tells the world

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,560
that if they didn't have a strong hand

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,600
on every part of this country and its policy,

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,880
we would have chaos.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,120
The government seems to tell the people

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,360
that if they're prospering,

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,080
if they're getting richer, if the market is working,

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
they don't need political freedom.

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,120
What is the truth of all this?

49
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,520
What is the truth of all this?

50
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,440
I think the government's position is not without reason

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,320
I do think there are a lot of problems in China nowadays,

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,720
if the government doesn't have a strong hand

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,600
China will fall into some kind of chaos.

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Although China is a nation that is really fond of revolutions,

55
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,200
however this government is really afraid of revolution.

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,080
They know if there is ever a revolution in the future

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,120
if there policies are not strong enough

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,280
if there is another revolution from the bottom up

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,040
that is not from the top down,

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,520
Actually no matter if it is top down or bottom up it will change the destiny of this nation.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,960
If there is ever going to be another revolution

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,320
it won't be another revolution like the Cultural Revolution

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,120
because the Cultural Revolution was totally under control

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,200
in the hands of Mao

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,960
if there is ever going to be another revolution

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,120
it will be like the revolution that

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,160
overturned the Qing dynasty in the 1911, the Xinhai revolution.

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,800
I think that revolution will end in total freedom and anarchy

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,360
maybe there will be two hundred plus parties,

70
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,840
social groups, overnight

71
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,480
and you know we wake up one day

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,680
and we belong to a dozen parties we don't even know

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,160
because they listed you,

74
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,600
and you don't even know about them.

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,320
It would be this sort of situation, a governmentless situation.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,640
And then over time we will decide our path again

77
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,920
will we become a democratic free country

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,600
or after a lot of violence and even wars,

79
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:03,440
will we become another authoritarian country again, I really don't know.

80
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,000
So, sum it up, the Great Leap Forward ended in famine, a disaster,

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,640
the Cultural Revolution ended in a sort of disillusion,

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,960
it was just abandoned,

83
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,200
the Tiananmen Revolution ended in repression

84
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,760
and violence and death,

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,800
how does the market revolution end?

86
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,840
I think the end of the economic revolution

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,600
is pretty obvious now

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
is the destruction of our homeland.

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,040
However, what will happen after our homeland is destroyed

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,880
we still need time to figure that out.

91
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,720
Is this homeland destroyed?

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,080
I think we have already roughly destroyed our homeland,

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,280
we have a problem with water, with land, even with air,

94
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,560
what is left for us?

95
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,200
The people?

96
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,160
Our people are losing their health.

97
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,840
How about their minds?

98
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,080
I don't know about their minds.

99
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,360
Today's China is almost an era that

100
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,120
people's minds are most chaotic and schizophrenic,

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,800
so I really cannot figure out what is on their mind.

102
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,000
The last resource of China is the Chinese people,

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,280
surely they are not destroyed?

104
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,720
I was half joking and half telling the truth.

105
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,000
We end on a Chinese paradox!

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,320
Yes, we end on a paradox.

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,280
Just like the paradox of the cigarette dish and the no smoking sign.

108
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,560
Yu Hua, it is a joy to meet you

109
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,120
thank you, very, very much.

110
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
I am also very happy to see you Christopher, in Shanghai.

111
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,680
After we met in New York, I had not thought that I would see you in Shanghai.
