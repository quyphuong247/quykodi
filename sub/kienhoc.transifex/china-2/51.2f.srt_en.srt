“To Live” the movie and Artistic Limitations in China

1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,000
This is a little different but

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,080
you worked with, Zhang Yimou made the movie,

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,920
did you work with him on the movie?

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,760
It's one of the most beautiful pictures I've ever seen.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,640
Yes we cooperated, we talked about scripts for the movie

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,120
however when he was shooting the movie I was not there.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,720
How is it that you can read the book "To Live" in China,

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,160
but you can't see the movie?

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,520
This is a very complicated issue,

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,680
this is actually an issue full of Chinese characters.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,400
So, the first thing I wrote about

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,000
when I started my column in the New York Times

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,360
was the censoring system in China,

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,640
about the bureau responsible for movies in China

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,040
in the Central Government.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,560
However, the censoring of novels is only controlled

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,520
by the publishing houses.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,120
You don't need a person with a position higher than that.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,160
So these two different censoring methods

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,760
decided their two different fates [of the film and the book]

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:24,000
They are the same "To Live", the movie is censored, the novel can continue to be published

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,080
In reality there is an economic reason. The officials who work in the movie censoring bureau

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,840
they get salaries from the country.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,120
If there are 800 movies produced in China in a year,

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,480
if they stop them all, it doesn't influence their salary at all.

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,480
They can put on American movies in the cinemas.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,360
There is no economic incentive.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,680
However, those publishing houses are individual enterprises

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,720
they do not get a penny from the central government,

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,560
so they have to make their own money.

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,240
He wants to raise his own salary

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,840
He wants to raise the salaries of his employees

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
So when he is considering publishing a book

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,600
he wants to take risks,

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,040
while the official in the bureau that oversees movies is unwilling because he has no incentive.

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:18,520
while publishing houses must take risk, because only novels that are risky can make them good money.

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,880
This is a very strange phenomenon in China.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:29,200
I don't know if you have noticed

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,160
if you stay in many hotels in China

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,520
you will notice as you carry your luggage

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,080
when you walk into your room you will notice on the table

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,400
you will notice a cigarette dish, for when you smoke

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,880
and as you look again, you will notice not far away there is a sign that says "no smoking"

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,160
This is China. It puts a cigarette dish and a "no smoking" sign side by side.

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,240
So the novel is like the cigarette box,

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,520
the movie is the non-smoking sign.

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,760
That is their relationship, they are both side by side.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,040
We say it's a country of hard rules

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,320
and creative rule breaking at the same time.

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,560
I can at least say that China is a place full of contradictions and paradoxes.

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,280
Why is China full of contradictions? One aspect is as you mentioned

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,040
the rules are there but you can violate them anytime you want.

53
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,040
One other reason is

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,680
it was like this before.

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,480
It is a county where different things just co-exist at the same time.

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,280
You sometimes will feel like it is inconceivable, but our society is just this way

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,280
I learned in China that of course you can't see Google,

58
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,720
you can't see Facebook on the Internet,

59
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,760
you can also buy inexpensively a service

60
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,360
that will pretend you're in Canada or Venezuela,

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,240
and you can see everything.

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,040
Somebody said to me,

63
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,320
only in China will they ban the internet

64
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,440
and then invent a way to make money getting around it.

65
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,240
The rules are set by the government,

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,040
however, they create ways to break the rule from the bottom up.

67
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,840
I have to say that Chinese people's skills to climb the wall,

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,640
the great firewall, are definitely the best in the world.

69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,880
There is a story, when this incident with Bo Xilai

70
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,040
and his subordinate Wang Lijun ran

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,720
to the American embassy in Chengdu

72
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,080
The central government had not decided how to address the Bo Xilai incident

73
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,440
Bo Xilai was in Chongqing

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:51,240
all the local government officers were very nervous

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,920
they wanted to find out what was happening

76
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,640
so there was one task for all their secretaries,

77
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,360
to look at overseas websites to find out what was happening.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,840
So you can see that even the very high level cadres

79
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,240
in China do not know Bo Xilai's fate

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,440
so they all had to go through foreign websites, to understand the political situation with China

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,000
so that can give you a glimpse of the political life in China.
