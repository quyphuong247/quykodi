Anger, Poverty, and Human Rights

1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,400
You write in the book “Ten Words” (“China in Ten Words”)

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,840
that there's a seething anger

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,480
that's the way it was translated

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,520
that seething anger is still sort of the main driving emotion

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,920
in this country.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,720
Can you explain that?

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,720
I think that the anger is not "seething" anymore

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,920
it's more and more obvious

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,840
All over the place there are, we call them group incidents,

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,480
for example, some violent events

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:49,160
this anger is right now changing, it used to only be targeted at the government.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,360
now this anger has been twisted to be directed at the common people.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,920
I'm not talking about the violent incident

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,560
that happened in Xinjiang

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,920
and also how Uyghur people responded

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,240
in the rest of China

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,440
because this is related to ethnic minority problems

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,360
and it's too complicated to talk about now.

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,760
What I'm talking about

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,080
are those violent incidents

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,240
that happen in schools for example, people go to schools to kill people

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,800
people go on public transportation

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,040
and detonate bombs

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,040
violence towards the common people is being expressed in this way

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,400
this illustrates more sharply how China's anger is certainly heightened.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,760
It used to be that people just targeted the government,

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,760
at most they break the government's doors, windows, burn their cars,

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,320
but now they target common people more and more.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:08,760
This is extremely frightening, the violence has already been twisted.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,640
What would change or redirect or appease that anger?

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,040
I can't see any hope of appeasing this kind of anger

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
I can only see the possibility that

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,320
they become more and more extreme in the future.

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,720
Because Chinese society has already reach the point of conflict.

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,360
Nowadays people don't have hope anymore

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,280
they don't have the same hope as they used to

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,400
people's thoughts have become more and more schizophrenic.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,040
Different people have different views so I feel

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,360
at this point it is very difficult to see that sort of hope.

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,320
People also speak though of prosperity,

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,400
their lives are better economically,

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,720
there's less extreme poverty,

43
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
does this count?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
Does this matter?

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,320
I couldn't see poverty being reduced in China.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,640
I feel that phrase is not used that accurately

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,400
because I don't actually think our country's poverty is decreasing

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,360
Maybe it's true in statistics

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,320
but I don't think poverty has actually been reduced in China, in terms of daily life.

50
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,000
Where is the poverty that worries you the most?

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,760
You can see poverty in any place in China

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,160
even in Shanghai

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,440
even in places like Beijing

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,440
they all have areas where the poor live

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
this you cannot question

56
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,800
Of course you cannot see poor people living in the Ritz Carlton,

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,040
Let's not look at how big our economy is,

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,240
"oh, we're the number two economy in the world, or something

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,760
how much our GDP has grown every year”

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,160
however, we should look at the rank

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,400
of the GDP per capita, in reality it hasn't much changed

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,640
we always rank roughly around 100 in the world.

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,200
We move up a little bit, we move down a little bit

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,600
and the best we get is around 90.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,720
I think the real way to evaluate how well Chinese people live

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,680
is to look at the average income of Chinese people.

67
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,560
Not the country's overall economy.

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,280
You say the average income is 90-100 on the rank of nations?

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes.

70
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,160
How do you measure the spiritual, the human damage

71
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,600
of the new revolution,

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,280
to family, to identity

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,720
to human sovereignty at an individual level?

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,840
What's going on?

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,760
Speaking of the damage on family,

76
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,600
if we compare this Capitalist Revolution

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,520
to the Cultural Revolution

78
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,240
of course in the Cultural Revolution

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,880
the family was also destroyed to a large extent.

80
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,360
That is because the family was persecuted

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,800
because they were considered rightists, or landlords or for other reasons and the parents divorced

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,640
this was still a small group of people because only a small number of people were persecuted.

83
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,680
However after the 1980s, in this economic revolution today,

84
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,280
the rise of the economy parallels the rise of divorce

85
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,200
this may be because of the changing economic dynamics of the family

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,120
which influence the families insecurity.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,600
Anyway, today the divorce rate is rising every day.

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,640
From the human rights perspective, there was also a huge change

89
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,480
because after the Cultural Revolution ended

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,120
we suddenly discovered that generation of Chinese people

91
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,560
had no place for individual activity

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,320
after the Cultural Revolution ended

93
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,720
Deng Xiaoping gave individuals some space

94
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,040
for social activity.

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,680
Then people started to be concerned about human rights,

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
be concerned about democratic freedom,

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,400
and that's how the June 4th incident broke out.

98
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,320
However, that revolution was short lived.

99
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,920
The Cultural Revolution is a revolution of monopoly

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,560
and the Tiananmen Square Incident is a revolution of democracy,

101
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,280
it is a revolution to strive for democracy. It ended very quickly

102
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:55,600
From the 1990s on when China's economy speedily rose, people all turned to economic revolution

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Today, to be honest, the number of people who are concerned with human rights

104
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,680
is not becoming more and more, but rather less and less

105
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:14,760
unless you infringe on their individual human rights, then they think that human rights should exist

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,400
when you do not impact their own rights they may not think about human rights

107
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,040
they might think about how much they made today.

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,640
So the influence of the Capitalist Revolution

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,280
has a really bad influence on the human rights in China.

110
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,760
This revolution has made Chinese people profit driven.

111
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,440
They care less about other people

112
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
which also means they care less about the country.

113
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,560
So this bout of economic revolution, you can also say its a capitalist revolution

114
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,760
Its impact on human rights might be very different than what Westerners think.

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:04,120
They might think that the economic revolution would help human rights

116
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,360
but it actually does not really help.

117
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,600
More and more people have no interest in human rights
