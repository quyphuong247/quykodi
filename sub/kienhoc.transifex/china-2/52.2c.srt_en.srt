1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,020
Let's talk about the Taiwan miracle.

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,840
In the early days of the newly relocated ROC government on Taiwan,

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,100
the Nationalists wanted to establish a stable economy in part

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,850
to ease the unrest of native Taiwanese and to develop

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,030
a state-owned military industrial base sufficient to retake the mainland.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,230
They succeeded well enough in the first goal.

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,340
In the 1950s, the Nationalists oversaw a land reform-- land

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,870
to the tiller, compensation to the landlord-- on Taiwan

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,850
that would prove much more successful, much more

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,600
enduring, than the violent confiscation, collectivization,

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,330
communization of landed property on the Chinese mainland.

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,640
Taiwan's agricultural sector thrived, and it would

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,870
help to finance industrialization.

14
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,140
The industrial development that would mark the Taiwan miracle was not,

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,250
however, the state-led, military-oriented, producer industries

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,720
controlled by mainlanders, which had been the original plan.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,500
But the small to medium size enterprises marginally

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,390
owned by Taiwanese that were first allowed to develop and then to export.

19
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,240
By the late 1950s, when Mao Zedong was abandoning

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,330
the international socialist economy for his harebrained scheme of the Great

21
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,450
Leap Forward toward self sufficiency, Taiwan

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,400
embraced what we can call it's great leap outward

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,720
into the international capitalist economy.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,640
The subsequent stunning success of Taiwan's export-led growth

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,672
and its attraction of foreign investment where there had been virtually none--

26
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:57,570
this was predicted by nobody.

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,760
To be sure, this was not a triumph of neoclassical economics.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,100
The Nationalist state continued to govern the market.

29
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,330
As the excellent book by Robert Wade puts it--

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,940
"at home with an industrial policy designed

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,980
to promote specific export industries."

32
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,580
It retained a strong economic bureaucracy

33
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,580
that would retain an important role in guidance planning.

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,060
And State-Owned Enterprises continued to be protected and subsidized.

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,690
But the now largely private Taiwanese-owned export-oriented economy

36
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,050
was allowed to cohabit with and ultimately outgrow

37
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,440
the Nationalist state economy.

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,460
When Taiwan's international political situation deteriorated in the 1970s,

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,310
the ROC made even more concentrated efforts

40
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,900
to develop export industries so as to strengthen

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,200
Taiwan's regional and global position in the absence

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,450
of the international political support that it had enjoyed earlier.

43
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,110
In 1978, it created a scientific and technical advisory group

44
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,630
to assist state-owned and private enterprises

45
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,590
to break into areas of high tech, like semiconductors.

46
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,790
The State Sponsored Industrial Technology Research Institute

47
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,510
sponsored research and development and encouraged

48
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,890
the return of US-based Chinese to Taiwan to take

49
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,860
charge of the computer industry-- most famously,

50
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,760
Morris Chang from Texas Instruments, the founder and now still chairman

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,240
and CEO of Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing company.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,130
By 1999, Taiwan led the world in the production

53
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,480
of computers and peripherals, claiming a 91% market

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,890
share in the production of scanners, 68% in keyboards, 64% in motherboards.

55
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:55,270
Between 1952 and 1999, according to Taiwan's government information office,

56
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,542
the economy grew at an average rate of 9.2%.

57
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:06,690
And from 1981 to 1999, it grew at an average rate of 7.15%.

58
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,690
Taiwan came to be known as one of the four Asian Tigers along with Singapore,

59
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,100
South Korea, and Hong Kong.

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,110
As a globally-engaged, export-oriented, and highly industrialized

61
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,790
capitalist economy, Taiwan has seen per capita income growth

62
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:29,500
to now nearly $40,000, making it one of the most prosperous places

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,750
in the world.

64
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,490
It is held membership in several major international economic organizations,

65
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,780
including the World Trade Organization, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation

66
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,410
Forum, and the International Trade Union Confederation,

67
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:51,190
even as it has been excluded from nearly all international political

68
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,740
organizations.

69
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,968
