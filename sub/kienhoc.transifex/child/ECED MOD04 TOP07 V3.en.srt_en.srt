00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,430
In this topic, we'll talk about
inclusion and diversity.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,094
Let's begin with diversity.

4
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:18,460
So diversity by definition is
the realm of differences that

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,760
there are within our society.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,340
Some of these differences
include cultural,

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,660
socioeconomic difference,
ability--

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,370
so that might be difference
in physical ability or

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,479
intellectual ability.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,190
We have gender, race,
religion, and age.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,360
These different areas of
social diversity are

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,095
experienced by children
on a daily basis.

13
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:46,129
They're experienced in their
homes, in their neighbourhoods

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,290
and community, even in the care
settings where they may

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,950
go if they're in care, so
kindergarten or long day care.

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,240
They'll see social diversity
on television.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,670
They'll read about it.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,510
So it's something that they are
already being very much

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,780
exposed to.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,489
But it's important that we make
sure our environments

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,820
reflect this cultural

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,330
diversity and social diversity.

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,770
So there are plenty different
ways that we can do that.

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,580
This can be done in activities
that we provide or with the

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,750
resources that we
have on hand.

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,830
And it's important that it's
done regardless of the actual

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,280
diversity within the group, so
that it's part of everyday

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,170
activities, what we do
on a daily basis.

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,580
Let's now talk about
inclusion.

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,345
So inclusion is exactly
how it sounds.

31
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,130
It means including.

32
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,324
So when we think about
inclusion, it's important that

33
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:40,840
our practice is to think about
how do we include everybody.

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,270
So this includes families,
children, adults.

35
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,899
It includes anybody from the
diverse, different areas that

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,260
we have within our society.

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,490
Sometimes when we think about
including everyone, it's about

38
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,640
recognising any barriers there
are for people to be involved

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,830
in what it is that's
happening.

40
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,500
So how do we remove
those barriers?

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,490
Do we need to change our
physical environment, or do we

42
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,559
need to adapt our resources?

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,120
Do we need to translate things
to make sure that people are

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,300
being included with language?

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,970
Inclusion's a very important
part of celebrating cultural

46
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,000
diversity and society's
diversity, so it's important

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,900
that it's part of our practise
to really recognise how

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,280
important it is to include
everybody.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,360
Let's have a think about how we
can support inclusion and

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,230
celebrate diversity in a formal

51
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,190
early childhood setting.

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,780
So some of the ways that we
can do this is by ensuring

53
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,190
that we have resources that
reflect cultural diversity.

54
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,510
So this might be about making
sure, say, in a home corner co

55
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,345
where you would usually just
have pots and pans and a

56
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:48,820
teapot and cups, you might
also have chopsticks or a

57
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,549
bamboo steamer.

58
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,840
You might look at the posters
that you have on the wall or

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,520
the toys that you have for
children to play with.

60
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,060
You might also think about
having some of your resources

61
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,890
translated into different
languages, because this can be

62
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,609
an inclusive practise.

63
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,780
But supporting inclusion and
celebrating diversity

64
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,690
shouldn't just be tokenistic.

65
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,780
One of the ways that we can
avoid that from happening is

66
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,650
making sure that we involve the
families of children in

67
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,290
our programming and activities
in formal early childhood

68
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,410
settings, so that they're
reflecting

69
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,090
their own family culture.

70
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,010
And that's then reflected
within your

71
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,730
early childhood setting.

72
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,600
And it comes across as then
being very respectful and

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,900
encourages that type of thinking
for children to be

74
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,700
empathetic and compassionate
and to enjoy other people's

75
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,950
differences and diversity.

76
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,452
