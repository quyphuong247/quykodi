2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,219
As children become involved in
discovery and learning through

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,050
experimentation, there possibly
can be an element of

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,240
risk involved.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,090
And it's a controversial
topic.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,130
You know, should we allow
children to take risks, or

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,950
should we just wrap them up in
cotton wool and tell them how

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,270
to do things?

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,570
I can't tell you how you
think about that.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,930
But you have to make
up your own mind.

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,610
Some of us evaluate
risks as being a

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,750
lot higher than others.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,510
Some of us maybe push the
boundaries a little bit more.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,080
That's really up to you.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,199
But what I really would like you
to consider is risk-taking

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,080
really such a bad thing?

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,269
And I guess it's important,
perhaps, to think

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,160
about your own life.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,959
And think about something that
you're intensely proud of, and

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,750
that you can look back on and
you can say, gee, I really did

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,129
well with that.

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,910
Often, when we look back, we
realise that the thing we feel

23
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,759
most proud of didn't
come easily to us.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,900
It was actually hard work, and
it might have had an element

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,200
of risk to it.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,330
And that's because risk-taking
actually builds our sense of

27
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,020
mastery, and therefore,
our self-esteem.

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,080
One of the problems, of course,
when we're dealing

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,710
with children, is that it's
difficult for them to project

30
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,279
into the future.

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,860
They don't always look ahead
and evaluate the risks that

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,260
they are about to take.

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,220
They go up a tree, and
they get stuck.

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,960
They swing too high on
a swing, and they get

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,110
frightened.

36
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,120
But, as learning is trial and
error, as long as they remain

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,390
reasonably safe, they learn
something through that

38
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,080
experience.

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,490
They learn, well, actually, I
might not climb so high next

40
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,890
time, and actually, I won't ask
that adult that I'm with

41
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,820
to push the swing quite as high
as they did last time,

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,940
because it actually
made me scared.

43
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,990
So in many ways, through
risk-taking, we learn to know

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,369
a bit about ourselves.

45
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,880
We actually understand our own
strengths, and we learn to

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,900
understand our own
limitations.

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,330
So while risk-taking actually
helps to build our sense of

48
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,090
mastery and our self-esteem,
sometimes things

49
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,030
don't always go right.

50
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,280
We make mistakes, and through
trial and error, we actually

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,550
find that there's more errors
than there are wins.

52
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,930
But that develops what
we call resilience.

53
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,020
In other words, the ability to
bounce back even though things

54
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,690
might go wrong for us.

55
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,390
Resilience isn't also about the
experiences that we have,

56
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,880
because each of us take to
every situation our own

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,840
temperament.

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,630
And you know yourself, there
are people who are a little

59
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,470
bit more guarded about the
things that they do, and those

60
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,080
that sort of jump in,
boots and all.

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,270
Those gung ho sort of people.

62
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,490
So we actually have a
temperamental disposition that

63
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,720
affects the way we actually
develop resilience.

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,970
So really, the bottom line is
that a resilient child feels

65
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,240
good about themselves.

66
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,650
They feel good when they're
alone, and they feel good when

67
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,730
they're with others.

68
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,119
In other words, they know
that they have the

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,490
strength to face the world.

70
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,760
So how do we, as adults,
support children?

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,359
How do we help them to develop
that resilience that they are

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,830
strong enough to
face the world?

73
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,220
I guess the first thing to
really think about is to do

74
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,120
your own risk assessment.

75
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,670
And you know, we can't
keep them wrapped

76
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,809
up cotton wool forever.

77
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,220
We have to let them go, and we
have to let them explore, and

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,050
we have to let them discover.

79
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,180
Otherwise, they'll never really
be able to understand

80
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,290
and come to terms with her own
strengths and limitations.

81
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,070
So no, we're not going to expect
them to know on their

82
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,180
own how to cross a freeway,
but we might give them a

83
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,730
little bit more time, perhaps,
to climb a tree, or go down a

84
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,500
slide, or do some of the things
that children naturally

85
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,150
want to do in order to move
forward in the world.

86
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,390
We also have to understand that
mistakes are normal, and

87
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,585
show empathy for that.

88
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,839
You know, even just the phrase
like, I know, that happens to

89
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,329
me sometimes, too.

90
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,130
I don't always get
things right.

91
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,260
It shows that we're human, and
that we make mistakes as well.

92
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,320
We might even go further and
say to a child, gee, that's

93
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,150
not like you, you normally do
things really well, to build

94
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,219
that expectation that, just,
it's one mistake.

95
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,080
Don't worry about it.

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,440
Just move on.

97
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,740
That really helps them to
develop that strength of

98
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,590
resilience.

99
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,940
The other thing to remember as
an adult is that children have

100
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,760
to practise making decisions.

101
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,570
It's not something that
comes naturally to us.

102
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,870
But if you make small decisions
when you're younger,

103
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,840
when it's not life-threatening,
when it's

104
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,950
not going to damage life or
limb, then we actually start

105
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,070
to build our decision-making
muscles, so to speak.

106
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,700
And so that when we become a
teenager, when life is a lot

107
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,380
more threatening and there's a
lot more risk out there, I

108
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,860
always think about when
I raised my children.

109
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,960
I wanted them to have strong
decision-making muscles,

110
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,330
because I knew that there would
be a time when they may

111
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,280
be faced with something, that
they had to listen to that

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,780
voice in their own head, and
make up their own mind.

113
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,530
And, in my case it was, I
thought, what if they ever get

114
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,599
to a party and somebody says
to them, oh, look,

115
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,520
I'll take you home.

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,640
And they know that that person
who's invited them into their

117
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,650
car has probably had
too much to drink.

118
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,539
And I want them to think, and
stop, and say, now what would

119
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,440
mom think, or what would
my teacher think?

120
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,270
I wanted them to actually think
about that voice in

121
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,870
their own head and say, well,
what do I think is the right

122
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,260
thing to do here?

123
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,180
And my goal would be, of course,
in that situation,

124
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,390
that they just said,
no thanks.

125
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,640
I'm just going to call a taxi.

126
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,163
