2
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:13,400
One of the things about growing
up is that we have to

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,550
learn to get along with others
and to get along in the world.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,410
And that's particularly hard for
our toddlers because they

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,110
want to control everything.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,480
They have a sense of autonomy,
and they get

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,400
frustrated very easily.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,529
They know what they want to
do, but they're not always

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,580
allowed to do what they want,
so they do get really

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,629
frustrated.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,830
They want it, and they
want it now.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,420
So it's important that we
understand this, but it's also

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,230
important to support them to do
what we call self-regulate.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,250
In other words, to control
their emotions.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,255
So we might use phrases such as,
I know you're hungry, but

16
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:51,430
your lunch will be here soon.

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,450
We might use a phrase such as,
I know you're angry, it hurts

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,790
when you get bitten.

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,510
I understand.

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,670
And then we might think about
preparing our toddlers ahead

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,070
of time so that we give them a
little bit more warning as to

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,770
what's going to happen, rather
than just springing something

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,190
on them straight away.

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,950
So we might say to a toddler
something like, yeah, well

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,430
you're going to be settling down
to sleep very, very soon,

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,400
so would you like to grab your
shoes and bring them inside

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,520
with you now?

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,490
So how else can we support our
toddlers as they're getting

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,990
along in the world?

30
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,490
Because they do understand
language, we can start to give

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,850
them simple choices.

32
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,940
And the way that choices work
for them is that they give

33
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,070
them a little sense
of control.

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,350
It's not a lot, but it's a
small amount of control.

35
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,979
The point with giving choices
is that we keep them

36
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,060
extremely, extremely simple.

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,410
Don't complicate life by giving
too many variations.

38
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,429
Just keep it simple.

39
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,780
So you might say to a child,
would you like jam on your

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,840
toast, or would you
like honey?

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,610
You're not going to go through
everything in the supermarket

42
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,679
and offer all of those,
just a simple choice.

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,949
What you'll find when you give
choices is that children start

44
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,360
to get used to it.

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,170
And they realise that you really
mean that that's it.

46
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,980
You're not going to offer, even
if they complain and they

47
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,869
say, but I want something
else.

48
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,430
They know, if you just speak
calmly and you just say, well,

49
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,540
would you like jam, or would
you like honey, and I'm not

50
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,299
going to shift from these
options, that they actually

51
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,040
start to understand that
adults really do

52
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,980
mean what they say.

53
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,510
The important point to remember
as adults, when we

54
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,980
are offering choices to
children, is to make sure that

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,600
what ever option we offer, that
we're deliriously happy

56
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,560
with either.

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,660
Because, like a moth to a flame,
if we offer a child a

58
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,100
choice that we're not
necessarily happy with, you

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,090
can bet which one they're
going to pick.

60
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,795
So be very careful and think
ahead, and think, well, what

61
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:01,739
am I really going to
be happy with?

62
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,050
So you're trying to bring
a child in from

63
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,660
outside, for instance.

64
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,230
You might say, would you like
to come inside now, or would

65
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,260
you like to come
in five minutes

66
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,840
when I'm serving lunch?

67
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,420
A simple choice so they have the
option of staying back if

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,480
they want to.

69
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,790
It does lower the resistance in
the children, and it means

70
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,903
that we can get the
job done, too.

71
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:26,590
So apart from giving simple
choices, what else can we do?

72
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,600
Well, I use what I call backup
statements when I'm working

73
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,700
with children.

74
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,530
And a backup statement, simply
explained, is that it tells

75
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,870
the child what the adult is
going to do, not what the

76
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,940
adult wants the child to do.

77
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,840
So for example, a child sitting,
eating their lunch.

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,630
We can say, come on, eat
it up, eat it up.

79
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,490
Off you go.

80
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,840
But as we probably have
discovered when we worked with

81
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,510
children or lived with children,
that they don't

82
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,940
always do exactly what we say.

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,640
And we can't make a child eat.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,410
We can try.

85
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,460
We can nag.

86
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,490
But we can't actually
make a child eat.

87
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,250
So how do we go about this?

88
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,790
Well, with the use of a backup
statement, what I might say to

89
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,880
a child is, I'm going to leave
that plate on the table there

90
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,060
for you for about another
five minutes.

91
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,839
Do you think that'll give you
enough time to finish it?

92
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,710
And then five minutes later,
I can actually go

93
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,219
and remove the plate.

94
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,940
So what I've actually done is
I've described the behaviour

95
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,680
that I'm going to show, not what
I want the child to show.

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,430
So we are a role model for
toddlers and for preschoolers.

97
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,910
So a simple instance might be
that we demonstrate to our

98
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,170
toddlers and preschoolers
how to actually

99
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,360
get along with others.

100
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,680
So we might say something simple
like, you know, if you

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,290
pull her hair it'll
actually hurt her.

102
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,740
So can you just stroke
it like this?

103
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,000
And actually demonstrate
the action as well.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,040
So through our language and
our demonstration, we're

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,540
modelling appropriate language,
and we're also

106
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,020
modelling appropriate
behaviour.

107
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,419
It's important to express
ourselves and tell children

108
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,790
how we feel.

109
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:16,600
So for instance, if a child is
making a racket at the lunch

110
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,190
table, we might say something
like, gee, it's really hard

111
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,260
for me to listen to you
when you're banging

112
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,020
your spoon so loudly.

113
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,150
I can't really hear what you're
trying to tell me.

114
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,950
And finally, let them know
what we can manage.

115
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,130
We're human, too, we have needs,
and we can't always be

116
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,400
doing everything for children
all at the same time, or we

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,849
can't always give them exactly
what they want.

118
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,550
So if we're busy with something,
we might say to a

119
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,020
child, oh look, I can't pick
you up at the moment.

120
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,180
I'm busy dancing with
the other children.

121
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,970
But if you'd like to take
my hand, you can

122
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,570
dance with me too.

123
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,130
So dealing with everyday
behaviours is really about

124
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,469
thinking ahead.

125
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,700
Children naturally want things
right then and now, but as

126
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,690
adults we can role model, and
we can role model not only

127
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,300
language, but behaviour.

128
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,680
So think ahead.

129
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,650
Think about simple choices that
you can offer children.

130
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,969
Think about backup statements
that describe the behaviour

131
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,240
that you will elicit, not
necessarily what you

132
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,610
want them to do.

133
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,350
And consider reflecting
your own emotions.

134
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,850
Because you are modelling for
them how you think and feel,

135
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,850
and teaching them to think and
feel positively, as well.

136
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,070
And so, for the remainder of
this module, I'm going to hand

137
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,290
you over to my colleague,
Caitlin.

138
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,350
And she's going to walk you
through some further aspects

139
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,600
of becoming.

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,490
