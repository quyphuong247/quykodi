2
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:13,950
So when children are
discovering, what we find is

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,420
that they become engaged.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,360
Well, what does engaged mean?

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,060
I mean, basically, it means
to be involved, to perhaps

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,200
persist even though they're
being challenged, and once

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,910
they've actually accomplished
something, to

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,980
really delight in it.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,600
It's what we might
call absorption.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,450
And it's actually quite an
interesting topic, and those

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,720
of you that would like to
research it might like to have

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,860
a look at that concept of
the psychology of flow.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,790
And what flow actually means,
it's a time when we, as

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,150
adults, and it happens for
children as well, when we get

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,010
a sense of time just
standing still.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,629
And it's usually when we're
doing something that we really

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,230
are good at, and that
we really enjoy.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,019
So it might be simply
reading a book.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,300
It might be having a
conversation with a friend.

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,080
Perhaps for you, it might be
playing a musical instrument.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,730
And it's really at that time
where the level of challenge

22
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,290
meets the level of skill.

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,010
And I'll show you
how that works.

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:22,140
Here we have challenge, and
here we have skill.

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,950
Now if I'm operating at a very
low level of skill, but I'm

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,490
having to actually perform
because the challenge put in

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,000
front of me is very high, what's
going to happen is I'm

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,335
going to be very anxious.

29
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,949


30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm actually, I could even feel
quite fearful of a new

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,170
situation that I'm confronted
with, because I'm not really

32
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,440
that good at it.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,920
Whereas, if I have a very high
skill level, and the challenge

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,190
is very low, then I'm probably
going to just simply feel

35
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,230
quite bored.

36
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,710
It's very ho hum.

37
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,449
I know how to do it, so
give me something more

38
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,150
challenging to do.

39
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,580
So what we're looking for in
flow is to meet that beautiful

40
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,570
point up here, where we have the
right level of skill for

41
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,680
the challenge.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,960
It could be just this level
of skill, or it might be

43
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,150
something even more, depending
on how good we are at a

44
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,520
particular thing.

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,670
So what we're trying to do here,
in terms of looking at

46
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,450
that concept of engagement, is
saying is the child moving

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,790
into that state where they're
so absorbed, they're so

48
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,829
engrossed in what they're doing,
their learning new

49
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,930
skills, but they're doing it at
a rate where the challenge

50
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,250
is meeting that skill.

51
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,430
So let's look at a method of
how we actually engage our

52
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,150
preschoolers.

53
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,180
We call it project-based
learning.

54
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,470
And basically, with
project-based learning, we're

55
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:03,800
really trying to get a situation
where preschoolers

56
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,740
become highly involved
in a research topic.

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,960
So the first step is,
as I said, research.

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,800
So really, what they're doing is
they're looking around and

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,940
finding out something that
they want to know.

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,190
It could be anything.

61
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,440
It could be something to do with
how a car might work, or

62
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,940
why the waves come in at the
beach, or why it is that the

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,530
sun comes out in the morning,
any particular thing.

64
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,060
And it's best if it is actually
involved with the

65
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,410
real world that they're immersed
in on a daily basis.

66
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,859
Secondly, we ask them
to observe what's

67
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,960
actually going on.

68
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,210
Well, are the waves coming in?

69
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,960
How often do they come in?

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,320
When does the sun actually
come up?

71
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,000
What does a car look like if
you lift up the bonnet and

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,220
look under the engine?

73
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,000
Why does a car have a battery?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,910
What's that purpose?

75
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,260
And then finally, when they've
done their observations, we

76
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:11,120
ask them to interpret
their findings.

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,005
So in other words, we're asking
them to say, well,

78
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,159
you've looked at that concept
of having a battery.

79
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
Well, why is it that that
battery is there?

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,230
Why do you think it actually
works that way?

81
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,920
Or why is it that the
sun does come up?

82
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,220
And we ask them, when they're
interpreting, to actually

83
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,830
represent that in some
particular way.

84
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,729
So some children will go away
and draw a picture about what

85
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,730
they've discovered.

86
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,670
They might actually write
some simple words.

87
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,330
They might even ask an adult to
write a sentence for them.

88
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,710
I realise that the sun comes up
in the morning because the

89
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,440
Earth turns around to face
it, something like that.

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,290
A simple sentence like that.

91
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,480
So they represent that.

92
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,250
It might even be just something
simple like having a

93
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,640
conversation with a friend.

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,760
But the purpose of this
project-based learning

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,120
approach is to involve our
preschoolers deeply in

96
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,310
something, and so that
they remember.

97
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,130
It's real learning that they
remember, and will recall for

98
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,920
many years to come.

99
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,320
So have a look at an example
of preschoolers involved in

100
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,890
project-based learning
specifically.

101
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,659
In this situation, these boys
were asking the question, a

102
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,870
research question, do phone
have ears like we do?

103
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,015
Because how is it that we can
hear when we pick up a phone

104
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:33,200
and we can hear someone
else talking?

105
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Do they have ears that
pick up those sounds?

106
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,690
So what they did was they
started to observe and look

107
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,940
around and investigate, really,
what was actually

108
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,900
inside the phone.

109
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,159
Because you can't discover if
a phone has ears unless you

110
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,560
actually open it up.

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,910
So first of all, they had to
really solve the problem of

112
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,550
how they opened up the phone
in the first place.

113
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,840
And then, when they actually did
open it up, see what was

114
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,770
actually inside it.

115
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,260
And then of course, finally,
they needed to interpret what

116
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,719
they had discovered.

117
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,220
And in this case, they
definitely realised that the

118
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,560
internal circuit board within
the phone doesn't look like a

119
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,000
human whatsoever.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,210
So that probably led to a
further research question.

121
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,810
Well, how is it that a phone
does actually work, if it

122
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,731
doesn't have ears?

123
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:27,680
The point, of course, in this
project-based learning for

124
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,390
these children, was that they
were excited about something

125
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,340
that they didn't know,
and keen to

126
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,590
investigate it further.

127
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,061
