00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,830
In this topic, we're going
to explore role

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,960
modelling and imitation.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,300
As adults, we need to be keenly
aware that we're role

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,310
models for the children
in our lives.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,000
This isn't just for
the bigger things.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,920
This is also for the
very simple things.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,520
So if we have a look at this
clip, we can see a group of

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,580
children who are sitting around
having lunch together.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,164
They're finished, and they're
clearing their plates.

11
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:34,850
The educator is with them and
is walking around and

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,520
reminding them how to do this.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,520
And it's obvious that the
educator's shown them this

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,950
procedure before, because you
can see the children, even

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,910
though they're quite young, are
capable of scraping their

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,129
plates off where they need to
and putting the plates and

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,860
cutlery where they
need to as well.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,510
Children learn from what they
hear, from what they see, from

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,860
the behaviours that
we show them.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,769
When they identify with a role
model, then they're more

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,380
likely to decide to take those
behaviours on themselves.

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,319
So they start to look for
opportunities to practise

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,340
these new things that
they've seen.

24
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,320
This is imitation.

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,669
When children imitate, they're
trying on new behaviours or

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,810
new roles that they've
seen other people do.

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,440
So imitation may be
about language.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,009
Perhaps you've heard
a child trying

29
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,520
some different language.

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,350
It might be out of their
vocabulary, or perhaps out of

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,589
their developmental range.

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,670
But they've heard it, and
they're trying it to see if

33
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,910
there's any impact for it.

34
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,610
They might also imitate
people's

35
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,530
reactions to scenarios.

36
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,180
So if their mum gets very
stressed in situations,

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,260
perhaps they start to get very
stressed in situations.

38
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,490
And they think that this is the
natural reaction to have,

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,399
because they've seen
their mother do it.

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,750
They've seen her role model
this behaviour.

41
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,670
More often than not, we'll see
children imitating through

42
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,700
role play and drama,
so they'll try

43
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,150
on different roles.

44
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,180
This could be as simple as
cooking in a kitchen.

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,440
You may see children playing in
home corner in child care

46
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,490
or even at home with
pots and pans.

47
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,979
They've seen their parents doing
it, and they're going to

48
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,470
give it a try.

49
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,710
You might see children trying on
dress ups, perhaps adults'

50
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,960
clothes that maybe refer to
different occupations or just

51
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,380
to what their parents wear.

52
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,880
So they're trying those
on to imitate as well.

53
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,670
And you may also see some
fantasy start coming into

54
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,829
these games, so children will
think outside of the square a

55
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,430
little to make these
games occur.

56
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,930
But usually, what they're doing
is trying on behaviours

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,890
that they've seen within role
models themselves, something

58
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,779
that their parents or their
family, perhaps their

59
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,430
educators, have done that they
want to see if they can do

60
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,940
themselves.

61
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,810
One form of imitation that can
concern parents is when

62
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,930
children start acting out
what they've seen on

63
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,010
television or in film.

64
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,950
Sometimes you'll see children
exhibiting behaviours that

65
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,619
appear to be violent or
aggressive, when in fact

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,460
they're not.

67
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,050
So they're trying on roles that
they might have seen,

68
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,790
maybe through the news
or different films.

69
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,810
So they might play violent games
or construct guns or

70
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,170
things along those lines, but
it's not something really that

71
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,890
we should be concerned about.

72
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,649
The intention is not for the
child to be aggressive.

73
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,190
The intention is instead for
the child to try and

74
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,859
understand what it is
that they've seen.

75
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,730
This is why imitation is so
important, because it is about

76
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,799
children trying on different
roles so that they can start

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,380
to grow to understand the
community in which they live.

78
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,630
