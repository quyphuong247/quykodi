00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,660
Welcome back to this, the
final module in early

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,135
childhood development.

4
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:21,270
I'm Helen.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,290
I'm an early childhood
consultant

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,820
representing Gowrie Victoria.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,360
Last module, we discussed
being.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,619
We talked about giving children
time to be children,

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,560
and we looked at how infants and
toddlers and preschoolers

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,640
have time to be and what they
really need from us as adults.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,620
So today, we're going
to expand on

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,660
the concept of becoming.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,769
We're going to talk
about optimism.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,140
How do children develop
optimism?

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,460
Do they just have it naturally,
or do they learn

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,850
optimism from those
around them?

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,530
We're going to look at how
they acquire values.

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,170
We're going to talk about having
high expectations,

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,540
because often as adults, it's
how we expect children to

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,760
behave and what we believe of
them that they actually then

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,230
fulfil and become
in themselves.

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,370
We're going to talk about the
importance of inclusion,

23
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,220
because children are
all different.

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,200
They come from very different
families.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,130
They all have different ways of
seeing the world and ways

26
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,990
of learning.

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,869
And how do we as adults
actually embrace that?

28
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,650
Finally, we're going to look at
the idea of social capital,

29
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,830
which is quite a funny term
really, social capital.

30
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,280
What does that actually mean?

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,450
We're going to explore that, but
really what we're looking

32
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,380
at is what outcomes we
want for children.

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,800
Are they good for them, and are
they good for the society

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,950
and the community in
which they live?

35
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,260
When we consider the concept of
becoming, we naturally ask

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,940
the question, well, when is the
right time to introduce

37
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,030
children to a formal learning
environment?

38
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,680
When is the right time to
start teaching them some

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,970
literacy and some
numeracy skills?

40
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,780
That is a really big debate.

41
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,750
But what we do know is that
children can't acquire those

42
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,540
skills until their brain
circuitry is ready for it.

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,390
Really, the development of
literacy and numeracy skills,

44
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,270
it's gradual, and it's very
ability dependent.

45
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,040
So it's different
for every child.

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,140
And I guess if you really want
to explore that, I'd encourage

47
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,019
you to look at some research
on when is the best time to

48
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,050
introduce formal learning.

49
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,820
&quot;The quality of the home
environment, which is

50
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,209
obviously the most practical and
accessible venue for early

51
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,230
literacy activities, is the most
important determinant of

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,760
literacy development.&quot; So that
statement from the Centre for

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,100
Child Health is really saying
that we have a big influence

54
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,359
as parents on our children's
early literacy development.

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,560
So we can do all sorts of
things to support that.

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,930
We can, for instance, share
reading with our children.

57
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,030
Sit down in a comfortable
place.

58
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,810
Talk to them about the book.

59
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,300
Point at the pictures.

60
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,470
Let them elaborate.

61
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,340
Let them label some of the
pictures themselves.

62
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,550
Be careful to choose books that
have a predictable and

63
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,010
repetitive text, particularly
when children are young.

64
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,679


65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,560
I can recall one called
Something Absolutely Enormous

66
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,200
where Sally loved to knit.

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,350
She loved to knit, knit,
knit, knit, knit.

68
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,890
And what you'll find is that
children start to read along

69
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,570
with you, because they
can predict what's

70
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,400
going to happen next.

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,140
Ensure you have a
literature-rich environment.

72
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,970
In an early childhood setting,
you'll find there's not just

73
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,310
picture books for children, but
there is access to lists,

74
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,350
to cookbooks, to magazines.

75
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,630
Everything that we in the adult
world embrace in terms

76
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,620
of literature, we can role model
that to our children.

77
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,870
One of the most powerful ways to
develop literacy is to show

78
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,150
children that we're interested
in reading ourselves.

79
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,910
And, of course, never forget the
power of songs and rhymes.

80
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,230
Children love the predictability
of songs and

81
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,660
rhymes and chants.

82
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,620
You may even remember some of
the rhymes from your own

83
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,050
childhood, such as &quot;Ipsy Wipsy
Spider climbed up the water

84
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,300
spout.&quot; Children love to
act those out with us.

85
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,210
It's all about developing that
literature-rich environment.

86
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,019
