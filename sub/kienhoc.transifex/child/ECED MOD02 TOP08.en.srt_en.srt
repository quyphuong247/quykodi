00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,870
In this topic, we'll be
talking about social

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,870
development.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,340
So social development is the
development of behaviours that

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,320
help us get along
with each other.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,110
In this first image, you can
see three children swinging

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,090
together on a tyre swing.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,460
In order for that experience
to be a positive experience

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,460
and a fun experience, each of
those children need to exhibit

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,740
behaviours that helps them to
get along with one another,

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,520
cooperate, and have fun.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,930
So what is socialisation?

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,810
Socialisation is the ongoing
learning and acquisition of

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,120
values and beliefs, roles and
attitudes and behaviours from

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,349
family and from friends and from
other people that help us

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,600
to fit into and be accepted
by our community.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,770
For young children,
socialisation generally begins

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,660
with their family.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,190
So they'll learn the values
and beliefs of their own

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,899
family, and they'll take on
these attitudes and behaviours

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,110
themselves as they move
into their community.

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,960
So we can see in this first
picture here the child who's

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,970
using tongs to pick up
their food and put

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,190
them on their plate.

25
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,950
This is probably from a family
who values manners around the

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,510
table or even hygienic practises
when eating food.

27
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,310
And in this second photo, we can
see a child and an adult

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,630
doing some gardening together.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,600
This may come from the attitude
that the environment

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,419
is important or the
belief that the

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,200
environment is important.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,270
And the adult's role modelling
these behaviours to the child.

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,020
Let's have a look at social
development for toddlers.

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,009
When toddlers socialise, you
often see them interacting

35
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,910
mainly with an adult.

36
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,880
They will play alongside each
other, which is something we

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,060
called parallel play,
which we spoke about

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,700
earlier in the modules.

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,040
But they're not very likely
to use all that kind of

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,710
cooperative play that
we see later on.

41
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,910
So we can have a look at
this short film clip.

42
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,820
Here you'll see two children
and an educator at a child

43
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,019
care centre, and they're
playing in the sandpit.

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,590
You can clearly see
the two children

45
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,490
interacting with the educator.

46
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,960
And although the same activity's
going on for both

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,810
children, the children
aren't actually

48
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,710
interacting with one another.

49
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,670
This is a good example
of parallel play.

50
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,230
The reason that toddlers won't
play together as much until

51
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,880
they're a bit older is because
they haven't fully grasped

52
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,700
things such as turn taking
and cooperating.

53
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,420
However, you will see them
interacting together, because

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,429
often they like to imitate
each other.

55
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,120
So if one's dancing, you'll see
somebody else will come

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,010
across and start dancing
as well.

57
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,290
Or perhaps you'll see a group
of toddlers all sitting

58
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,530
together involved in the same
activity, like listening to

59
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,570
someone read a story.

60
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,870
When children become
preschoolers, they begin to

61
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,540
play games that have more
defined roles and perhaps more

62
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,540
cooperation involved.

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,859
This is because they're starting
to develop pro-social

64
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,940
behaviours, and these are
behaviours that they exhibit

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,180
in order to get along
with other people.

66
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,900
They're also developing theory
of mind, which is the ability

67
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,560
to think about how other
people might

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,060
be thinking or feeling.

69
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,200
But we'll cover both pro-social
behaviours and

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,920
theory of mind a little later.

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,769
So some examples of games that
preschoolers may play.

72
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,110
These would be games that
perhaps have simple rules.

73
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,130
You might have seen preschoolers
playing games

74
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,340
like memory or sporting games
that have simple rules.

75
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,450
You'll also see them playing
a lot of imagination games.

76
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,170
So they might play games like
hospital, where someone is a

77
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,429
doctor or someone
is a patient.

78
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,330
And taking on those roles is
really important to them as

79
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,860
part of that getting along.

80
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,420
Supporting the opportunities for
children to be social at

81
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,350
any age is an important thing,
because it helps them to

82
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,739
develop their individual
identities and also for them

83
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,740
to get along within
the community.

84
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,040
