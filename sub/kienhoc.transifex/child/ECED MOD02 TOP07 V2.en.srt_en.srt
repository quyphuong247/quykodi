3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,720
So for the rest of this module,
I'm going to hand you

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,930
over to my colleague, Caitlin.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,800
She's going to continue our
discussion on early childhood

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,840
development and learning, and
specifically on emotional

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,759
development, social development,
role modelling

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,520
and the role of imitation, and
on how children develop

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,689
empathy and compassion
for others.

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,800
In this topic we're going to
be looking at emotional

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,029
development.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,340
Emotional development refers to
a child's growing awareness

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,900
of their feelings and their
emotions, how to control

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,400
these, and how to react to them
in certain situations.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,360
So let's have a look at a theory
that was produced by

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,000
the developmental theorist,
Erikson.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,730
And it looks at emotional
developmental theory in three

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,099
stages, those of infancy, in
toddlers, and then onto

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,540
preschoolers.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,160
And each of those stages
are named.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,229
The first one for infants is
trust versus mistrust.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,180
And for toddlers, it's autonomy

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,060
versus shame and doubt.

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,260
And last we look at
preschoolers, which is

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,780
initiative versus guilt.

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,070
Let's begin with the infants
and trust versus mistrust.

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,750
So as we've discussed in earlier
topics, attachments

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,720
and reciprocity are parts of
a child developing trust.

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,539
And we know this is important
for emotional

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,820
development in children.

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,360
I might use a simple table to
help understand why developing

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,770
trust for infants is important
for her social and emotional

33
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,990
development.

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,780
So we'll start with the heading

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,560
trust and then mistrust.

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,540


37
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,880
And we'll look at some
elements down here of

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,270
emotional development.

39
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,800
The first one being
self-esteem.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,550


41
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,130
So if a child has developed
trust in infancy then their

42
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,549
self-esteem is going
to be high.

43
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,360
However, if they've developed
mistrust, if their needs

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,370
haven't been met as an infant,
then it's likely that their

45
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,480
self-esteem won't be so high.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,489
This means they're less likely
to try new things, which takes

47
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,313
us to our new point,
exploration.

48
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,640


49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,730
Exploration describes the
likelihood of a child to want

50
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,530
to try new things, perhaps to
explore their environment, and

51
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,070
even to make mistakes
and learn from them.

52
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,370
If they've developed trust at
an early age, then they're

53
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,920
likely to want to explore
their environment.

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,179
And they're likely to try new
things and new challenges.

55
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,230
However, once again, if there's
been mistrust in those

56
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,000
earlier years, they're
not so likely to

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,470
want to try new things.

58
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,600
Lastly, we can look
at relationships.

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,290
If there's been trust in those
early interactions that an

60
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,720
infant's had with their primary
caregiver, and they've

61
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,310
developed that trust as a result
of warm and caring

62
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,570
responses, they're very likely
to be able to form positive

63
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,100
relationships, relationships
that are reciprocal and

64
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,570
worthwhile.

65
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,739
Unfortunately, once again, if
there's been that mistrust

66
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,920
there, and an infant hasn't had
the opportunity to rely on

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,440
somebody to provide them with
caring and warm responses,

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,460
it's not so likely that
they'll have as caring

69
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,970
relationships and perhaps
have difficulty forming

70
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,210
relationships at all.

71
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,790
So just to recap, we had a
look at infants and trust

72
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,380
versus mistrust.

73
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,540
Now, we're going to move into
looking at emotional

74
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,420
development for toddlers.

75
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,709
And we call this stage autonomy

76
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,950
versus shame and doubt.

77
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,679
With toddlers, their skills and
developing all the time.

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,180
And it's important that they do
more things for themselves.

79
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,440
And they'll want to do more
things for themselves.

80
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,930
Autonomy, or being autonomous,
means being able to do things

81
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,290
for yourself.

82
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,010
The problem is that often
toddlers won't necessarily get

83
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,989
these things right.

84
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,980
So you'll see them making
a lot of mistakes.

85
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,599
In this clip, you'll see a
group of toddlers sitting

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,790
around a lunch table.

87
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,170
One girl is reaching
across the table.

88
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,840
She's going to be pouring
herself a glass of water from

89
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,820
the small jug.

90
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,430
And you'll see that she
knocks the jug over.

91
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,965
The water goes everywhere.

92
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:33,469
And her reaction is to look
around to see if anybody's

93
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,050
going to respond.

94
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,160
She's probably wondering what
the reaction is, because she's

95
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,380
aware that she's
made a mistake.

96
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,260
And in this case, my guess would
be that the educators

97
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,525
would have come across to her.

98
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:46,390
They probably would've said to
her that it was OK, that this

99
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,620
was a mistake.

100
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,020
That sometimes water is spilled,
and that we can

101
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,570
easily fill up the jug again.

102
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,980
And perhaps she'd like
to have another try

103
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,360
at pouring her drink.

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
Our responses need to be fair.

105
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,909
We need to think about how the
toddler is going to feel if we

106
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,420
tell them that the mistake that
they've made is somehow

107
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,680
their fault.

108
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,730
This is the talking about the
shame and doubt part of

109
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,790
autonomy versus shame
and doubt.

110
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,830
So practicing their skills,
sometimes making mistakes is

111
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,010
all a part of their emotional
development.

112
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,030
But us, the way that we react
to their mistakes, that's

113
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,309
going to determine whether the
child goes on to continue to

114
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,180
try and do things for themselves
or feel shameful

115
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,370
about it and perhaps doubt
their own abilities.

116
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,770
In this last part, we're going
to look at preschoolers and

117
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,359
the stage of emotional
development that's known as

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,060
initiative versus guilt.

119
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,300
Preschoolers are developing
even more skills

120
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,260
than toddlers are.

121
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,260
And they want to do everything
for themselves.

122
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,510
And it's important that we
support them in this

123
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,190
initiative stage so that they
can decide that they're going

124
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,790
to do things of their
own accord.

125
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,710
They don't always need
to be led to do them.

126
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,650
If we look at this sequence
of photos, we

127
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,620
can see a young boy.

128
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,550
He's taken the initiative to put
his shoes and socks back

129
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,560
on, I think, probably after
playing in the sand pits.

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,640
He's found his socks.

131
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,229
He's putting those on
the right feet.

132
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,570
And he's found his boots.

133
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,930
The end result does seem like
he may have put the boots on

134
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,590
the wrong feet.

135
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,750
But he's very happy
with himself.

136
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,100
And this has been an
example of how

137
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,440
initiative can be supported.

138
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,219
Had the response to him putting
his shoes on the wrong

139
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,220
feet been something along the
lines of, you've done it the

140
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,500
wrong way, or maybe let me do
it for you, then perhaps we

141
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,610
might have seen guilt
developing.

142
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,570
It's so important that when
we're supporting children

143
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,969
through their emotional
development, we support them

144
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,670
without giving them the negative
responses to any

145
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,140
mistakes that they might make.

146
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,159
Looking back over the three
stages of emotional

147
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,960
development, that of infants, in
toddlers, and preschoolers,

148
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,849
we can see how important it is
to support these different

149
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,030
stages in a positive way.

150
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,150
And when we do that, children
are able to develop healthy

151
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,669
self-esteem.

152
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,820
They're able to feel confident
to explore to make mistakes

153
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,849
and learn from them.

154
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,300
And they'll be confident in the

155
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,640
relationships that
they develop.

156
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,840
