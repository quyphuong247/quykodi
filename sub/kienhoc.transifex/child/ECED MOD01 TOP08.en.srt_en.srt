[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,470
Central to understanding
the world of a

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,960
child are three concepts.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,610
I'm going to talk you through
each of them.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,140
They really collectively form a
vision for what we as adults

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,850
in Australia believe is
important for children.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:36,810
And they are belonging, being,
and then another B, becoming.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,080


10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,600
Belonging--

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,440
&quot;Knowing where and with whom
you belong is integral to

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,890
human existence.&quot; So why is it
integral to human existence?

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,250
Well, basically we are
social beings.

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,370
We live in groups.

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,019
We live in communities.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,450
And fitting into that
community is very

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,250
important to us.

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,060
It's asking the question,
well, do people like me?

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,600
Do people love me?

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,380
Am I able to contribute within
that group as well?

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,410
I'd ask you to think
about perhaps a

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,420
place where you belong.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,460
It might actually be a physical
place, say within

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,089
your own home or even a room
within your own home that you

25
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,180
really love to go, that really
makes you feel great when

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,070
you're there, relaxed, peaceful,
and just as though

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,136
you really don't want to leave
it because it's you.

28
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,759
It's your place.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,830
Or it might actually be
somewhere outdoors.

30
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,350
Some people like to retreat
to the bush.

31
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,330
And when they get there--
or maybe to the beach--

32
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,020
they just take a deep breath
and they go, [SIGHS].

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,920
I feel like I'm home.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,630
It might actually be within
a group of people.

35
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,759
So it might be within your own
family that you have a great

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,160
sense of belonging.

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,090
Perhaps it's even in
your workplace.

38
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,160
Perhaps it's with a group of old
friends that you've spent

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,889
lots of time with, and almost as
though when you're having a

40
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,040
conversation everyone knows what
each other's thinking.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,470
It's different for all of us.

42
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,390
But the central thing we all
share is that deep sense of a

43
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,359
need to belong with people
and somewhere

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,350
that we feel at home.

45
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,650
Being--

46
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,080
&quot;Childhood is a time to seek
and make meaning of the

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,100
world.&quot; And we specifically
say childhood is that time

48
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,560
because it's hard for us to
remember back when we were

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,870
children and how important it
was for us to actually spend

50
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,660
some time just being free and
alone and allowed to engage in

51
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,020
things that we were really
interested in.

52
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,710
We live in a very fast-paced
world.

53
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,730
We always seem as adults to be
in a hurry to go somewhere.

54
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,049
And so we often bring our
children into that fast-paced

55
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,180
life with us.

56
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,620
And sometimes it's important
just to slow everything down

57
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,780
and maybe have a look at all
the activities that we're

58
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,210
rushing our children through and
think to ourselves, could

59
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,780
we simplify our life just a
little bit and allow them to

60
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,540
actually spend a little bit
of time just growing up?

61
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,609
&quot;Becoming reflects the process
of rapid and significant

62
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,650
change that occurs in the early
years.&quot; Yes, and the

63
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,770
early years do mark a rapid
amount of change.

64
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,960
But becoming for a child
is a process.

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,970
And they're often in
a hurry to grow up.

66
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,490
They want to be like adults.

67
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,020
So it's important for us to
understand that becoming takes

68
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,370
time over many, many years.

69
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,180
And we often talk to children
about what they're going to do

70
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,800
when they grow up, almost as
though we think that's

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,110
actually going to
happen tomorrow.

72
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,200
But children will change their
mind many, many times

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,160
throughout their formative
years.

74
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,640
So we can talk to them about
the fact that you're a good

75
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,010
writer, or you're a good
listener, or you're really

76
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,130
good with music, but that
doesn't necessarily mean that

77
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,510
that is who they will become
in their older years.

78
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,430
The other thing we need to
appreciate about becoming is

79
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,520
it's not just about what you'll
do when you grow up.

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,310
It's also about who you will
become as a person.

81
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,140
And our role modelling in the
way that we teach them values

82
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,900
and beliefs is critically
important.

83
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,780
Because it's from us that they
become compassionate human

84
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,299
beings, they become honest, they
understand what's really

85
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,460
important and what
sits with them in

86
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,239
their own value system.

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,810
And they'll take
that into their

88
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,060
adulthood world with them.

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,170
