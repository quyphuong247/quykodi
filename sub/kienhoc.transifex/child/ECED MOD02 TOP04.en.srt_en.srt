2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,905
Along with attachment comes
the issue of separation.

3
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:18,520
Now separation can be a positive
thing, but it can

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,160
also be a negative thing.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,570
In our case study with Ben,
it was a positive one.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,150
He crawled away to explore his
world, and then he knew he

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,670
could come back whenever
he wanted to.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,480
But sometimes we're put in
situations where a child does

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,309
have to separate from us.

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,780
Perhaps we're off to work, and
we need to place them in a

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,050
formal early childhood
setting.

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,839
Perhaps we just need to
leave them with a

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,820
grandparent over night.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,600
Perhaps we need to leave them
with a friend while we just

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,070
head off to do something that
we've got to get done.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,390
All sorts of situations arise
where caregivers and infants

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,090
have to naturally separate,
and the child may actually

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,420
show what we call separation
anxiety or some distress in

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,120
that situation.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,660
So what might we expect?

21
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,869
Well, if we're leaving a child
with somebody else, be it an

22
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,810
educator or a family member or
perhaps a friend, what we

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,220
might expect is that when we
first move into that setting

24
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,140
that the child will possibly be
clinging on to us, perhaps

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,930
just holding us tightly
on the arm.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,570
They'll also be looking around
the room, really sort of

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,610
trying to check out what's
actually happening.

28
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,429
And if you watch their face,
you'll see that they almost

29
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,450
know what's going on, and they
may even just start to cry

30
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,480
then and there.

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,890
As we persist, we might actually
pop them down on the

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,530
floor and hand them over
to somebody else.

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,940
They will possibly cry again.

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,810


35
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,729
If they're mobile, they might
even try and follow us as we

36
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,930
leave the room.

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,540
That's perfectly normal.

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,310
It's just part of that anxiety
that comes around from them

39
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,570
knowing that we're going away.

40
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,760
What's important--

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,049
and we're going to discuss
that in a minute--

42
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,850
is how we actually support
that process.

43
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,460
So around about 2 years of age
just roughly, we might even

44
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,780
find that separation anxiety
really starts to escalate.

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,990
It really starts to ramp up.

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,310
And what we could possibly
expect is that when we leave a

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,450
child, now our toddler,
that they'll actually

48
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,560
scream quite loudly.

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,640
They might even throw themselves
on the floor in

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,250
desperation.

51
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,760
It's even been known for
toddlers to actually chase

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,549
their parents out of the room or
their caregivers out of the

53
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,850
room, and perhaps even pull
on their clothing

54
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,120
and say, no, no.

55
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,870
Virtually saying,
I want you stay.

56
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,960
So what do we need to remember
in order to support

57
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,690
separation?

58
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,320
First of all, it's normal.

59
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,709
As we said before, it's a
natural part of children

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,230
learning to become independent
and to explore their world.

61
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,869
Secondly, it's individual.

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,150
It depends a little bit on the
child's temperament, but it

63
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,550
also might depend on perhaps
they're unwell that day.

64
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,540
It also might depend
on the situation.

65
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,079
Perhaps it's a new environment
that they're moved into.

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,050
They're quite used to going to
one place, and then they have

67
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,580
to go somewhere different, and
so that separation might

68
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,390
actually escalate in that
particular time.

69
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,779
Another thing is that
it's shared.

70
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,140
And we as adults often feel as
anxious about separating from

71
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,260
our children as they feel about
separating from us.

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,929
It's also important to make
a timely departure.

73
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,220
So once you have handed a child
to an educator or to a

74
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:19,779
friend or family member, don't
hang around and wait for the

75
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,330
child to become anxious
again or for you to

76
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,880
become anxious again.

77
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,580
Once you've said goodbye, you've
told the child you're

78
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,719
going to leave, then
just do that.

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,810
Just leave, and allow the person
who's with the child to

80
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,870
reassure them and to
distract them.

81
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,900
So they might give them a
comforter, such as a toy or

82
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,789
their favourite blanket.

83
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,110
Or they might actually take them
over to the window and

84
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,720
try and distract them.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,080
The old &quot;have a look at
the doggy out in the

86
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,260
street&quot; works wonders.

87
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,320
Children can actually
be distracted.

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,370
And then once they've actually
settled down, they'll probably

89
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,370
be pretty right.

90
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,310
And if you are anxious, give
a phone call maybe 5 or 10

91
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,670
minutes later, and you'll be
surprised to find that they're

92
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,070
actually playing quite happily.

93
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,320
