2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,140
OK.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,520
In this topic, we're going to
talk about building social

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,469
capital and what that means.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,010
In 2006, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,410
Development released a report
that was called &quot;Starting

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,750
Strong.&quot; This report identified
how critically

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,430
important the early years are
for learning and development.

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,530
Here in Australia, our response
to the report was to

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,730
develop the Early Years Learning
Framework, which is a

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,470
guiding framework for principles
and practises when

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,910
working with and caring for
children, and it also outlines

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,870
learning outcomes that we
consider as the optimal

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,860
learning outcomes
for children.

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,940
This is because, as the report
suggests, it's so important

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,919
that we get things right from
the very start with children.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,050
When we do this, hopefully we
can avoid some of the social

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,360
issues and problems that may
occur later down the track.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,210
Let's take a look at the five
learning outcomes for children

20
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,129
that are included in the Early
Years Learning Framework.

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,300
The first learning outcome is
that children have a strong

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,940
sense of identity.

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,200
This means that we want children
to be able to ask

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,720
themselves, who am I?

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,960
And that they should answer,
I am a capable person.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,039
I'm a competent person.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,020
I'm confident, and
I'm supported.

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,270
I'm secure and safe,
and I'm worthwhile.

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,009
The second learning outcome is
that children are connected to

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,670
and contribute to their world.

31
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,590
This means that we want to see
children feel like they belong

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,230
within their community, but also
that they want to be part

33
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,760
of the world and their
community, that they're going

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,470
to be active participants, that
they're going to care

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,060
about other people and
the environment.

36
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,500
So this is about children's
empathy and compassion and

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,720
about their sense
of belonging.

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,080
The third learning outcome is
children have a strong sense

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,170
of well-being.

40
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,600
This is about children feeling
good about themselves, both

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,080
inside and out.

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,640
That they're physically healthy,
but also that they're

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,510
mentally healthy.

44
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,630
The fourth learning outcome is
that children are confident

45
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,130
and involved learners.

46
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,760
This is about having supported
children so that they feel

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,440
that they are capable of
attempting new things.

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,460
That they're excited and
engaged and they

49
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,080
want to learn more.

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,320
That the people around them
respect them and their

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,670
individual interests and
provide them with

52
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,929
opportunities to extend on their
abilities, their skills,

53
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,260
and their knowledge.

54
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,870
And finally, the fifth learning
outcome is children

55
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,360
are effective communicators.

56
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,830
This is looking at promoting
children's ability to

57
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,050
communicate in a
number of ways.

58
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,610
But it's not just about them
getting their message across.

59
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,720
It's also about them being able
to listen and take other

60
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,990
people's messages on board.

61
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,000
This is about encouraging them
to want to communicate with

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,320
their community.

63
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,640
When we support children to
achieve the learning outcomes

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,359
that we've just discussed,
we're supporting them to

65
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
become the very best
that they can be.

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,760
Children are becoming
their future selves.

67
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,850
They're developing
into teenagers

68
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,769
and then into adults.

69
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,880
They're going to be voting.

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,030
They're going to be
changing laws.

71
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,990
They're going to be looking
after one another and looking

72
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,470
after the environment.

73
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,990
So what we do now supports them
to be happy, healthy,

74
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,110
competent, and creative citizens
in the future.

75
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,190
OK.

76
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,990
So we've come to the end of
our subject, and we really

77
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,810
hope you've enjoyed learning
something about early

78
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,780
childhood development.

79
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,480
Yes.

80
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,609
Thanks for joining us, and we
wish you well for any further

81
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,380
study you undertake.

82
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,440
I invite you to go back to the
discussion forum and explore

83
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,300
some of the ideas and questions
that this subject

84
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,550
has raised for you.

85
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,695
