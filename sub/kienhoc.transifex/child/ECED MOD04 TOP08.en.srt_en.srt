2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,790
So what does having high
expectations mean?

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,570
Well, it doesn't mean setting
unfair goals for our children

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,600
or expecting them to do
something that's outside of

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,380
their ability or their
developmental area.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,154
But what it does mean is
believing that all children

7
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:28,820
are capable and competent, and
that they're all able to

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,950
succeed in their lives,
regardless of their abilities

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,620
and regardless of their
circumstances.

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,269
So as adults, we need to provide
lots of opportunities

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,280
for children to succeed.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,080
And we do this when we
understand their different

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,675
levels of abilities
developmentally, but also when

14
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:48,849
we understand how they approach
life, so what their

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,565
learning dispositions are.

16
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,730
Are they confident, or do
they need some more

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,120
support from us?

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,690
And when we understand these
things, then we can set fair

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,780
expectations and provide
opportunities

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,370
for children to succeed.

21
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,809
So when we're thinking about
supporting children to be

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,980
competent and to achieve
success, we need to think

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,740
about the kind of

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,899
opportunities that we can provide.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,120
And one of the ways we can
do this is by providing

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,620
opportunities that allow
for trial and error.

27
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,850
So you might ask a child to
put their shoes on for

28
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,419
themselves, or you might say,
would you like to have a go at

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,970
pouring a drink?

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,980
You might say, would like
to make a cake with me?

31
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,430
Or, pour this batter
into the cake tins.

32
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,760
And then you need to allow for
that trial and error, so that

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,050
children feel that they have
been able to have a go at it.

34
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,450
And if they make a mistake,
they can try again.

35
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,990
And if children are successful,
they're more

36
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,839
likely to continue
to explore their

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,110
environment and try new things.

38
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,620
Some of the other ways that we
can demonstrate having high

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,520
expectations of children is
through our responses.

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,700
And if we're positive when a
child attempts something,

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,810
regardless of whether they're
successful or unsuccessful,

42
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,510
the child's more likely
to continue to

43
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,590
want to try new things.

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,300
So that positive response
is really important.

45
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,690
We can also draw on our
knowledge of the child and

46
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,270
ask, what does the child like?

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,590
What are they interested in,
and what are they good at?

48
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,470
What are their skills?

49
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,900
What's their knowledge?

50
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,450
We can build on that and extend
those experiences, so

51
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,720
we can make sure that we're
providing opportunities for

52
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,270
children to succeed and to
become more competent in what

53
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,230
it is that they're doing.

54
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,070
So to summarise, when we have
high expectations for

55
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:33,450
children, we're saying
to them, capable.

56
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,510
You're capable.

57
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,200
You are capable of doing this.

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,060


59
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,010
Succeed.

60
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,260
You can succeed.

61
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,010


62
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,060
And believe.

63
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,310
I believe in you.

64
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,480
