Hi.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,720
Welcome back to this, the
third module of early

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,900
childhood development.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,830
I'm Helen.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,689
I'm an early childhood
consultant

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,990
representing Gowrie Victoria.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,790
In the last module, we discussed
the concept of

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,230
belonging and its importance
in children's lives.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,770
Today, we're going to
explore a question--

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,200
what it means to be free
to be a child.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,470
&quot;Every child has the right to
relax, play, and join in a

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,660
wide range of cultural and
artistic pursuits.&quot; So let's

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,099
explore what that
actually means.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,000
That quote comes from the UN
Convention for the Rights of

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,250
the Child, which was
written in 1988.

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,060
It actually wasn't that long
ago that we required our

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,050
children to join the workforce
almost like they were

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,500
mini-adults.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,830
If you look at this photo
here, you have children

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,780
alongside adults working on some
sort of production line.

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,930
Even the little girl at the
front there was propped up,

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,140
because she's not even tall
enough to reach the baskets

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,800
that she's working from.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,369
Isn't it wonderful that
things have changed?

26
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,700
Nowadays, we give our children a
lot more time to be children

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,790
and to have that time to just
play and become involved in

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,120
what they do.

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,440
But you have to ask yourself
the question, are they

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
learning while they're
playing?

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,970
When a child plays, does that
equate to learning?

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,429
Or is learning actually
a separate thing?

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,530
Do you have to actually be
sitting still and using your

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,350
head to learn?

35
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,580
Do you have to actually come
inside to learn, or can you

36
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,470
learn outdoors?

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,700
I understand this is
a controversial

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,400
topic, play and learning.

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,680
I think we'll debate it for
many, many years ahead.

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,240
But what I would ask you to
think about is how you

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,759
actually view play and how you
actually view learning.

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,680
Because culturally, it's
different for all of us.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,610
We all contextualise play and
learning in a slightly

44
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,240
different way.

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,540
But if you take a look at this
photo here for a minute of a

46
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,459
little girl playing with blocks
in the sand and ask

47
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,100
yourself, is she learning
anything while

48
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,040
she's sitting there?

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,980
Or is she just simply absorbed
in a fun activity?

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,989
And the boy with his hat
on pretending to be

51
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,600
construction worker.

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,079
Is there any learning going
on for him at the moment?

53
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,090
I think it's something that
you might like to discuss,

54
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,150
perhaps in the discussion
forum.

55
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,340
Ask yourself the question, how
do you believe children learn?

56
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,978
