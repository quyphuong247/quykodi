Hi.

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,150
Welcome back to this, the
second module in early

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,990
childhood development.

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,139
I'm Helen.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,390
I'm an early childhood
consultant

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,350
representing Gowrie Victoria.

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,170
In the last module, we looked
at the world of children--

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,300
how they develop and how they
learn and how our vision in

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,379
Australia to help children to
belong, to be, and to become

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,430
all that they potentially
can be.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,800
In this module, we're going
to explore the concept of

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,089
belonging, that fundamental
need for human existence.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,190
In fact, knowing where and
with whom we belong is

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,809
integral to our existence.

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,480
In this module, we're going to
explore attachment in babies

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,230
and have a look at how crucial
that is in terms of a child's

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,250
ongoing emotional and
social development.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,390
See, one of our roles as adults
is to nurture children,

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,130
so that, in turn, they grow up
to become empathetic and

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,170
compassionate so that they can
get along and contribute to

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,540
their world.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,010
You might like to visit the
discussion forum and consider

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,650
where you feel you belong and
talk to others about that.

25
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,540
Where is it that you feel you
really belong in the world?

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,790
