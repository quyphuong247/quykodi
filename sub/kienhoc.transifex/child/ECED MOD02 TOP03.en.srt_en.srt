00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,110
So in our previous case study
with Ben and his mother, we

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,419
saw what is the beginnings of
what we call reciprocity.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,030
In other words, the beginnings
of give and take.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,690
It's when an infant and their
caregiver start to have a

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,090
conversation.

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,290
First of all, it's very basic.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,330
The infant cries, and the
caregiver, probably in the

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,940
initial stages, doesn't know
what that cry is all about.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,879
And they ask themselves,
is he hungry?

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,250
Is he tired?

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,370
Is he in pain?

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,739
And then the caregiver
responds.

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,600
And what the baby learns at that
particular point is that,

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,550
oh, if I cry, someone
will come and pick

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,970
me up and help me.

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,750
It's the start of their
conversation together.

18
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,780
Gradually, the conversation
becomes more complex.

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,060
Instead of just a simple cry, a
baby will actually listen to

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,960
their caregiver's voice and
start to move their body.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,210
It's almost like a nonverbal
conversation

22
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,690
is starting to happen.

23
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,960
And what the baby is asking is
that, if I move while you're

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,440
talking to me, will you
keep talking to me?

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,020
Or will you go away?

26
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,080
And of course, if you do keep
talking to them, you'll see

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,240
that they keep moving their
body, often almost in a

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,160
rhythmic sort of exchange.

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,630
You talk a little bit.

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,990
They make some movement.

31
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,280
You talk a little bit.

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,810
They make some movement.

33
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,720
It's that back and forth
happening for us.

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,100
Infants also love to look at
faces, particularly if your

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,240
face is about 15 to around 30
centimetres away from them.

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,699
They'll zone in.

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,700
And of course, that magical time
when they start to smile.

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,115
They will smile at you.

39
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:09,220
You, of course, can't do
anything else but smile back.

40
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,330
And the baby soon starts to
discover that, oh, if I smile,

41
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,810
someone else will smile back
at me, and we'll be able to

42
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,030
stay there together enjoying
that exchange.

43
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,590
Let's take a look at a further
example of reciprocity.

44
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,370
You may have even seen it when
a child starts to learn the

45
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,380
game of peekaboo.

46
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,540
We-- as an adult--

47
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,440
we cover our eyes, almost as
though we've disappeared.

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,590
But of course, we open them
again, and they know we're

49
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,520
still there.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,480
What they do is they imitate us,
and it's a really, really

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,030
fun exchange.

52
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,910
Peekaboo, peekaboo.

53
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,390
It goes on and on.

54
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,140
Children will play
it endlessly.

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,029
But the thing with that game
is not only is there speech

56
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,950
involved, but there's
also those gestures.

57
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,980
And children are learning that
communication is very complex

58
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,220
and multifaceted.

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,630
It's also the basis, as we see
in older children, of being

60
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,885
able to take turns, because it's
that give and take and

61
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:19,820
that exchange that is the basis
of saying, all right,

62
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,640
I'll wait for you.

63
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,600
And then, in turn, you'll
wait for me.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,850
