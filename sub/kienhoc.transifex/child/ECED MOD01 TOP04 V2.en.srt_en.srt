2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,200
In this topic, we're going to
talk about toddlers and

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,430
development.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,720
Toddlers are in the age group
12 months to 3 years, and

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,640
they're called toddlers because
they're just learning

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,720
how to walk in this age group.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,740
So let's think about toddlers
and cognitive development.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,979
Between about 12 to 18 months,
a toddler will begin to be

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,910
more mobile, so they'll be
exploring their area more and

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,810
thinking a lot more about it.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,110
They'll also know that if they
do things like shake their

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,490
head, this means no, and people
will understand that

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,040
when they do it.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,510
As they get a bit older, they'll
spend a lot of time

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,739
playing on their own.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,270
They'll be quite happy to
entertain themselves, and

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,580
you'll see them spending time
just feeling things, trying

18
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,570
things out.

19
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,160
They don't really need
interaction.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,089
They can actually spend a lot of
time playing on their own.

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,400
They're also getting to a stage
where they can start

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,360
using an object and making it
into something that it's not,

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,640
so imagining that a block is a
car and moving that around as

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,290
part of their game.

25
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,850
Then when they get to about 2 to
3 years of age, you'll see

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,169
in their development they're
very compulsive.

27
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,770
So they're likely to try things,
even if they're not

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,190
sure what the consequences
are going to be.

29
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,399
So an example of this might be
that you'll see a toddler

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,130
start to climb a tree without
thinking about whether or not

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,330
they can't get down.

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,470
OK, let's have a look
at physical

33
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,215
development for toddlers.

34
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:34,640
If we look at between 12
months and 18 months, a

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,670
toddler will begin to start to
use utensils, so they'll be

36
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,260
holding things like a spoon
when they're eating.

37
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,650
Their control won't be great
though, so you'll often see

38
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,570
them revert back to
using their hands.

39
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,669
Between about 18 months and,
say, 2 years, a toddler might

40
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,560
be able to do things
like ride a bike.

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,820
So they're developing those
gross motor skills, which are

42
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,660
the big muscle skills.

43
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,240
They'll also have a bit more
control over their fine motor,

44
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,990
so you'll see them hold a spoon
with much more dexterity

45
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,402
or be able to hold a cup
up to drink from.

46
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,610
Then from 2 to 3 years, you'll
see a much greater control

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,490
over their fine motor skills.

48
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,680
They'll be dressing themselves,
although maybe not

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,250
still doing up buttons.

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,830
But they will be able to hold
utensils now with a lot more

51
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,260
confidence, and even do things
like chopping up fruit or

52
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,109
vegetables when they're
supervised.

53
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,130
Let's look now at social
and emotional

54
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,170
development for toddlers.

55
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,959
From 12 to 18 months,
toddlers are very

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,750
egocentric little people.

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,570
They think the world revolves
around them, and they have a

58
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,180
lot of difficulty controlling
their impulses.

59
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,260
So what they want,
they want it now.

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,420
And you'll see that sometimes
in their behaviours.

61
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,109
They'll become frustrated
and maybe emotional.

62
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,940
As they get that bit older,
you'll see them start to do

63
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,260
more play alongside
other children.

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,760
However, this is still not
really interacting play.

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,450
It's more like a
parallel play.

66
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,339
In fact, it's called
parallel play.

67
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,740
So they might play at the same
activity, but they'll be

68
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,180
playing just alongside each
other, not actually

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,250
interacting.

70
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,350
Between 18 months and 2 years,
you start to see the very

71
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,450
first signs of empathy and
compassion developing.

72
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,549
So you might see a toddler get
distressed if their friend is

73
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,300
upset or crying.

74
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,850
Then from about 2 to 3 years of
age, we'll see that young

75
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,120
children in this age group,
they still need a lot of

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,220
support from adults to regulate
their emotions.

77
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,880
So they're trying to have more
control over their emotions,

78
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,130
and they're starting to
understand that other people

79
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,290
are separate to them.

80
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,810
But we do need to support them
as the adults in their lives.

81
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,270
Finally, let's look at language

82
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,380
development for toddlers.

83
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,140
Toddlers can understand a lot
more than they can say, so

84
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,519
you'll often see them listening
intently to other

85
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,760
people talking.

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,429
But sometimes they might have
difficulty expressing what

87
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,850
they're wanting to say.

88
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,269
They'll still be using a lot
of gestures as a result.

89
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,960
Between about 18 months and 24
months, you'll see them begin

90
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,420
to engage in simple but more
conversational-like language.

91
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,690
They'll also have a lot more
humour entering into their

92
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,200
language as well.

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,114
Between 2 and 3 years of age,
toddlers are still relying on

94
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:10,400
a lot of gestures to
communicate, and they will

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,740
refer to perhaps a whole
sentence or a question by

96
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,920
using one word.

97
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,360
So you might hear them say
something like, &quot;park,&quot; and

98
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,290
what they mean is, can
we go to the park?

99
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,700
Now in our next topic, let's
look at our final age group,

100
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,099
preschoolers, and child
development for them.

101
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,093
