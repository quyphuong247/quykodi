2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,450
So we talk a lot in the adult
world about being stressed,

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,990
but do children feel
stress as well?

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,040
You could say pretty
much that they do.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,390
But how do we really
know that?

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,260
I mean, apart for those
behaviours such as crying a

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,840
little bit more or perhaps
being a little bit more

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,530
clingy, how do we actually
know that they are

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,350
experiencing stress?

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,580
Well, what researchers have done
have actually looked at a

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,170
child's cortisol levels.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,320
Now cortisol is a hormone that
is released into our body when

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,500
we're in stressful situations.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,930
Generally in children, what
happens is that at the start

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,180
of the day--

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,980


17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,925
so this is the time here,
and this is cortisol--

18
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,110


19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,179
usually at the start of the
day, children's cortisol

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,670
levels are actually
quite high.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,960
But as the day wears on, as
long as they're not put in

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,720
stressful situations, that will
actually start to drop.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,560
But if they are put in a
stressful situation, that will

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,510
actually start to
increase again.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,550
And in some cases, it
can get very high.

26
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,440
So apart from those common,
everyday behaviours that we

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,770
might observe, such as being a
little bit more clingy, as I

28
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,500
said, and a little bit more
crying, it also can be obvious

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,320
to adults that a child is
stressed, because perhaps they

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,419
might become more aggressive
than they used to be.

31
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,680
They might even start
to refuse food.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,380
They might have trouble
sleeping, protest about having

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,570
to go to bed.

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,380
Now this is not a child that's
always protesting about going

35
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,780
to bed, which a lot will.

36
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,190
But I'm talking about a child
that normally would be quite

37
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,810
compliant about that routine,
and then all of a sudden they

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,570
are starting to be concerned
about having to go to sleep.

39
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,420
It could also be that they
play out a stressful

40
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,660
situation, and you'll see
it actually acted

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,070
out in their play.

42
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,959
It might actually come out in
a drawing, a picture that

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,450
they've drawn.

44
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,280
Lots of ways that they can
indicate to us that there's

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,450
something wrong.

46
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,690
Another one which is really hard
to spot is if a child is

47
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,690
just simply withdrawn, and we
don't really understand why.

48
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,000
They might even seem a
little bit depressed.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
We might think they're actually
physically unwell,

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,550
but perhaps there's an emotional
cause to that.

51
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,860
So what are some possible causes
of stress for children?

52
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,710
We've talked about separation,
and obviously that's one that

53
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,750
we've explored in quite
some detail now.

54
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,630
But what might be some other
sources of stress?

55
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,040
I think one that we really need
to be conscious of is the

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,780
fact that children pick up
on our own emotions.

57
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,850
And we're busy adults
in a busy world.

58
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,730
Often we get frustrated, often
we get tired, and we often get

59
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,049
angry as well.

60
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,450
We're human.

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,959
But what we don't appreciate
sometimes is how that actually

62
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,690
projects onto children and
how much they take on

63
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,460
board our own moods.

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,940
Another source of stress for
them might be simply in their

65
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,600
social interactions.

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,410
They're trying to
make friends.

67
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,490
They're trying to belong in a
group with other children.

68
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,000
It could be that further down,
when they get a little bit

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
older, they could be being
bullied, and they're not able

70
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,470
to talk about that and to
actually express how they're

71
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,460
actually feeling.

72
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,540
Obviously, it can escalate even
further when we look at

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,250
situations such as abuse,
perhaps an accident, or even

74
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,460
perhaps a death.

75
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,950
That might be the
death of a pet.

76
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,690
It might be the death
of a close one.

77
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,820
And children will actually feel
a deep sense of stress

78
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,140
from those particular events.

79
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,729
So how do we support
a stressed child?

80
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,730
First of all, it's really
important to remember that

81
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,160
children react differently
in different situations.

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,400
So one event might upset
one child but be quite

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,969
fine with the other.

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,750
So don't expect that every child
will react in exactly

85
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,880
the same way.

86
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,200
Secondly, it's really important
to give them some

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,260
particular words in
certain cases.

88
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,260
If, for instance, they're having
trouble making friends,

89
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,640
give them some words like well,
what if you said to him,

90
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,969
is it all right if
I play with you?

91
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,520
Because we feel that children
know exactly what they're

92
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,340
supposed to do in given
situations, but it isn't

93
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,700
always the case.

94
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,750
If our child's being bullied, we
probably need to talk about

95
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,980
it with them and help them
through that situation,

96
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,620
perhaps giving them some
strategies that they can use

97
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,570
to actually cope with
that bullying.

98
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,230
It's not necessarily a case of
saying, well, just hit him

99
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,880
back, because that's
actually not going

100
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
to solve the problem.

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,469
It's about helping them to
understand why they've been

102
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,400
bullied and then to
give them some

103
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,320
resourceful answers to that.

104
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,880
Another thing we really need
to be careful of is to take

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,719
care of ourselves.

106
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,200
Because, as I said,
we're busy people.

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,460
We live in a very
hurried world.

108
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,560
I know as a mother that I used
to have these expressions, and

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,590
every time I said them, they
used to really annoy me.

110
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,890
One of them was &quot;hurry up,&quot;
and the other one, which I

111
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,270
really, really look back on
and think I shouldn't have

112
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,380
said that so many times, was &quot;in
a minute.&quot; We'll do that

113
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,830
in a minute.

114
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,400
So it's really important to
take care of ourselves and

115
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,890
perhaps to even slow our own
life down sometimes when we

116
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,669
have children and not try to
achieve so much in such a

117
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,720
short space of time.

118
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,800
If we are placing them into an
early childhood setting, then

119
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,020
do your homework.

120
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,740
Make sure you find one that you

121
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,860
believe is of high quality.

122
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,870
Because the research has shown
that in a high quality

123
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,130
setting, what will actually
happen to a child's cortisol

124
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,850
levels is that they are high
here in the morning and

125
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,070
throughout the day, they
actually decrease to a point

126
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,990
where we can actually see that
the child is quite relaxed and

127
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,500
happy and under no
stress at all.

128
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,390
If you have a child that has
suffered some sort of trauma

129
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,300
and you're concerned about them,
well, that's the place

130
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,120
to seek expert help.

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,280
I think the first port of call
would be to go to your local

132
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,780
doctor, your local general
practitioner, and they may

133
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,169
refer you on for extra
psychological help.

134
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,220
But don't leave that stone
unturned if that's something

135
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,470
that you're concerned about.

136
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,580
