00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,970
Following on from Helen's topic,
which discussed early

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,300
childhood settings, in this
topic we're going to explore

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,710
some of the codes and laws and
standards that guide and

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,040
govern Australian practise when
working with children.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,480
Let's start by talking
about regulations.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,500
In Australia we have national
regulations.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,570
These are law.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,200
These are things that have been
passed in legislation.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,650
And they're rules that
govern our practise.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,739
So some examples of regulations
might be that

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,520
anybody who wants to work with
children is required to have

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,960
the appropriate
working-with-children check.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,640
So these checks that they
haven't got a criminal history

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,420
that would prevent them from
working with children

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,700
appropriately.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,960
We also have regulations about
the number of staff per

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,210
children in an early
childhood setting.

19
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,690
These are called ratios.

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,290
So these are things
that are law.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,680
They're set in concrete.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,190
There's no shifting those.

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,039
The only time they change is
when legislation is passed to

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,330
change them.

25
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,570
The next thing we'll have a look
at is what's called the

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,020
National Quality Standard.

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,820
In Australia we have the
National Quality Standard as

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,050
our assessment and
writing tool.

29
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,149
It's a way that we can look
at all the early childhood

30
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,840
settings and services that are
provided and write the quality

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,520
of the service that's
being provided to

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,610
children and their families.

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,870
Within the National Quality
Standard there are different

34
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,060
quality areas.

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,510
And these cover everything from
health and safety, such

36
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,340
as hygiene practises and food
handling practises, right

37
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,650
through to relationships
with children.

38
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,570
So how warm and reciprocal are
the relationships that are

39
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,610
happening between educators and
children in their service?

40
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,630
The next guiding document that
we'll have a look at is

41
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,410
Australia's national framework
for early learning, and that's

42
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,039
called the Early Years
Learning Framework.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,750
The Early Years Learning
Framework guides educators in

44
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,490
their practise, so the way
that they do what it

45
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,690
is that they do.

46
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,460
It also gives them some guiding
principles for working

47
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,370
with children, as well as
providing the learning

48
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,310
outcomes that children should
really be achieving when

49
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,250
they're in early childhood
settings.

50
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,090
Next we'll have a look at the
Early Childhood Australia's

51
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,430
Code of Ethics.

52
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,370
This is a code of ethics
for people who are

53
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,170
working with children.

54
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,780
The code of ethics talks to us
about how, as professionals

55
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,880
working with children, there are
certain practises that we

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,940
really need to abide by.

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,280
Last but certainly not least,
we've got the UN's Charter on

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,130
the Rights of the Child.

59
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,790
This is a charter of articles
that outlines what the United

60
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,620
Nations signatories believe are
rights for children, so

61
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,790
what children have a right to.

62
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,470
Very similar to the Human Rights
Charter, but this is

63
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,890
specifically about children's
rights.

64
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,070
&quot;Acknowledge the uniqueness and
potential of all children

65
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,880
in recognition that enjoying
their childhood without undue

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,579
pressure is important.&quot; This
is an example of one of the

67
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,560
ECA Code of Ethics.

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,510
And it speaks to what we talked
about at the very start

69
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,310
of this module when we spoke
about the uniqueness of

70
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,075
children and the importance of
allowing children to develop

71
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,209
at their own rate and
their own pace.

72
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,080
&quot;Every child has the right to
relax, play, and join in a

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,630
wide range of cultural and
artistic activities.&quot; This

74
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,549
quote is an example of one of
the articles from the UN

75
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,930
Charter on the Rights
of the Child.

76
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,930
It also relates back to
information that Helen gave us

77
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,820
in one of the earlier topics
in the module about the

78
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,090
importance of play and how
children learn when they play.

79
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,640
OK, so just to recap, we
discussed the laws, the

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,070
regulations that we
have in place.

81
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,470
And these are the rules
that don't change.

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,109
They provide the foundations
for our

83
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,730
early childhood settings.

84
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,530
Then we looked at the quality
standards and the framework,

85
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,040
both of which are guiding
documents that help us with

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,850
our structure, our
practise, and the

87
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,890
principles in our service.

88
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,109
And finally, we looked at the
ECA Code of Ethics and the UN

89
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,089
Charter on the Rights
of the Child.

90
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,490
These are our overarching
documents that inform all the

91
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,440
other things that we do in
early childhood settings.

92
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,760
But it's important to remember
when you're looking for an

93
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,020
early childhood setting, either
for your own child or

94
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,719
if you're thinking about working
in one, that you do

95
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,080
some investigation.

96
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,520
Because there's lots of
different settings out there,

97
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,190
like Helen talked about
earlier in the module.

98
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,630
And remember that each setting
is going to be unique, just

99
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,050
like children are unique.

100
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,300
