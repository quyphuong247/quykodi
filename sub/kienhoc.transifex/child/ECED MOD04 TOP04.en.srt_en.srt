2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,610
So how does language develop
in children?

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,490
We know, of course, that babies,
when they're born,

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,770
after birth will cry to
communicate their needs.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,100
But then, how does that
translate into learning in a

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,660
particular language?

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,060
First of all, when babies are
born, they will start to just

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,150
make some very small
vocalisations, so quite apart

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,260
from crying.

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,410
And if you listen to them,
you'll hear them make sounds

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,569
like [LOUD MURMUR], and then
they'll [SOFT MURMUR].

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,280
In other words, they alter the
volume and the pitch, AND it's

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,310
almost like an experimentation.

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,490
They don't really know what
they're doing, but they're

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,570
just waiting, as we talked about
in reciprocity, for some

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,660
sort of feedback to see whether
they're going to get a

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,000
response to that.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Then the next stage is
when they really

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,190
start to copy sounds.

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,190
And it's actually really
interesting, because across

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,920
the world, their first
utterances are all

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,900
very much the same.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,450
Even though they end up speaking
another language, the

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,560
utterly utterances
are all the same.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,530
So you hear them making sounds
like &quot;da da da da da&quot; and &quot;mum

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,490
mum mum mum mum.&quot; So they're
actually copying the sounds,

27
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,140
and what you'll hear is that
children will be imitating the

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,510
sounds that they hear around
them and experimenting and

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,510
trying to form those words
for themselves.

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,120
Even in the first year of life,
children are able to

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,440
respond to different requests.

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,050
So if you say to a young
child, wave bye

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,619
bye, they'll do that.

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,550
Wave bye bye.

35
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,090
They'll actually understand the
request, even though they

36
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,580
might not be able to say it.

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,759
They'll also to respond to
simple instructions, such as,

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,910
don't touch that.

39
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,610
Don't touch that.

40
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,410
They know exactly what they need
to do, even though they

41
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,320
can't actually express
that for themselves.

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,449
The other thing that they tend
to do is what we call

43
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,230
overextend words.

44
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,350
So they might use the word
&quot;dog,&quot; but they might be

45
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,549
referring to a real dog.

46
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,670
They might be also referring
to a toy dog.

47
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,350
They might also refer to the
dog print on their pyjamas,

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,109
and &quot;dog&quot; is what they use for
all of those collectively.

49
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,180
This ability to understand more
than they can say extends

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,630
into toddlerhood.

51
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,549
We call it the difference
between receptive language and

52
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,060
expressive language.

53
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,460
Receptive language, of course,
is we receive language, so we

54
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,180
understand and we hear it.

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,660
Expressive, of course,
is we speak it out.

56
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,980
But when toddlers speak it out,
often they aren't really

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,140
easily understood.

58
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,950
And it's really often only the
people in their family that

59
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,049
can actually interpret
for them.

60
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,920
So if you spend time with a
toddler, they'll make all

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,420
sorts of words, and they know
what they're talking about.

62
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,760
But they're very simple words.

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,890
So they're expressing them
simply, but the thought behind

64
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,709
it is actually quite complex.

65
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,920
So they rely on people around
them to actually be their

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,519
translators.

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,980
They're also still using their
body a lot of the time, so a

68
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,670
lot of their communication
is in gestures.

69
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,220
So they'll still stamp their
feet, or even in some cases,

70
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,630
they'll act out a story and
show you the whole complex

71
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,070
story, even though the
words that they're

72
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,160
saying are quite simple.

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,720
So when children are using a
lot of gestures, it's very

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,460
supportive of us to actually
extend and to label common

75
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,840
things in the world.

76
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,610
So if they're pointing towards a
tree, for instance, we might

77
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,030
say, oh, yes, there's a
bird's nest up there.

78
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,910
So we're actually role
modelling simple

79
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,410
sentences for them.

80
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,790
The way we expand on children's
simple sentences

81
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,500
really helps them to
understand the

82
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,530
structure of language.

83
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,150
So if a toddler came up,
to us for instance,

84
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,910
and said, him sick.

85
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,090
And he might be talking about
his doll or an animal, a

86
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,460
stuffed toy or something like
that, we might then extend

87
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,570
that by saying, oh, is your
teddy sick, is he?

88
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,240
And then you might say, oh,
would you like me to call a

89
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,740
doctor for you?

90
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,050
And then the toddler might
say something like,

91
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,520
yes, bear is sick.

92
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,680
Bear is sick.

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,430
And so you're having a
conversation with the toddler.

94
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,470
Even though that the words that
they're expressing aren't

95
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,470
quite clear yet, it's through
our role modelling that they

96
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,680
actually pick up the tone and
the structure of language.

97
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,288
