00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,110
So how do children become
optimistic?

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,840
Do they learn, or are
they born with it?

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,430
Well, Martin Seligman, the
founder of positive

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,360
psychology, talks about the
fact that children are

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,320
naturally optimistic.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,400
They're born with a sense of
hope and really an immunity to

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,279
feeling helpless.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,750
In other words, they're actually
very, very resilient.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,950
So how do we identify each
element of optimism?

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,390
Well, for a start, an optimistic
child takes events

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,810
and looks at them quite
personally.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,190
So they'll say, you know,
I'm really clever.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,190
And then what they do is they
transfer that across to

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,839
everything that they do.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,910
And so they'll say something
like, and I'm just good at

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,300
everything.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,040
And they consider to be
permanent, as though it's

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,600
always going to happen.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,070
So they'll say something like,
I'm always going to be good.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,559
So how do we influence a child's
sense of optimism?

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,150
Well, it's actually very
important that the adults in a

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,540
child's world have a look at
the way that they speak to

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,470
children and how they explain
bad events or

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,030
good events to them.

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,130
And I'm going to run you through
a few examples, and

27
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm going to refer to this
model here, but not

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,730
specifically in detail.

29
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,590
But what I'd like you to do is
just reflect on the language

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,240
that I'm using and just see how
it sort of comes together.

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,020
So for instance, if a child--

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,929
and I hesitate to be negative
here, but I'm hoping it's

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,560
going to illustrate a point--

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,280
but if a child has an accidental
or makes a mistake

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,660
or something happens in their
world that you need to talk to

36
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,100
them about, then if you use this
sort of negative style

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,600
and you say, look, it's
all of your fault.

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,240
You'll never amount
to anything.

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,240
You always muck things up.

40
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,259
What you're doing is you're
influencing a

41
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,750
child towards pessimism.

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,160
Whereas if you say something
like, gee,

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,440
that's not like you.

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,630
You usually are really,
really careful.

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,680
Anyway, doesn't matter.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,970
Accidents happen.

47
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,620
You're a winner.

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,990
I know that.

49
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,410
Then that really does influence
the way that they

50
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,400
feel about themselves and how
they view everything that

51
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,820
happens to them.

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,959
So that's an example that's
perhaps in the context of

53
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,710
maybe a home environment.

54
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,350
But let's think about
an educational

55
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,850
setting for a minute.

56
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,370
If an educator speaks to a
child within those same

57
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,550
premises with that sort of
optimistic, explanatory style,

58
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,750
then they'll probably say
something like, oh,

59
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,140
that's not like you.

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,649
Gee, that's unusual.

61
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,430
Normally, I find that you
concentrate well.

62
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,100
I'm sure you're going to achieve
really well with the

63
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,900
things that you do.

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,030
You can see the difference, but
the words that we say are

65
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,810
so incredibly powerful.

66
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,390
And so if children are actually
born optimistic, it's

67
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,250
our job to make sure that we
continue to develop that

68
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,500
optimism for them.

69
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,967
