00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,180
So let's have a look
at attachment.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,480
What is that?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,720
Basically, it's an emotional
bond that

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,370
forms between two people.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,250
For a baby, it's generally
formed with their biological

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,640
mother, but it can also be with
anyone who gives them

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,180
constant love and care.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,720
It could be their father, could
be a grandparent, could

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,080
be an adoptive parent, foster
parent, or in some cases, even

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,559
an educator.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,800
So let's take a look at the
three phases of attachment.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,150
The first phase--

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,430
up until around eight weeks,
babies are trying to attract

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,850
our attention.

16
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,140
They cry.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,450
They babble.

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,930
And very soon, they
start to smile.

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,880
And in turn, caregivers start
to try and understand what

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,130
those cries are all about.

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,250
They might be asking,
is my child hungry?

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,230
Is my child in pain?

23
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,970
And it's actually the quality
of their responsiveness, the

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,570
timing and the quality of that
response, that actually starts

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,869
to make for a secure
attachment.

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,930
In phase two, the attachment
starts to become more

27
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,870
sophisticated, and the child
will perhaps even start to

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,300
cling onto their caregiver.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,700
They'll start to know the
difference between familiar

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,490
and unfamiliar voices.

31
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,009
And in fact, if they lying,
perhaps in their pram or in

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,880
their cot, and they hear someone
talking, a familiar

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,240
voice talking, they'll actually
track that person's

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,009
voice with their eyes or even
move their head towards that

35
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,680
familiar voice.

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,200
In phase three, the attachment
becomes even more complex.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,530
That's usually when a child is
starting to crawl, and it's

38
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,140
really important for them to
develop their independence and

39
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,300
to start to explore
their world.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,910
But what they'll do is
they'll stay very

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,978
close to their caregiver.

42
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,380
So what they might do is crawl
away for a little bit and then

43
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,460
come back, and then crawl
away a bit further

44
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,930
and then come back.

45
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,530
And then they'll start to get
really quite adventurous and

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,290
crawl quite a distance away
and then return again.

47
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,390
It's almost like seeing a rubber
band that expands and

48
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,420
contracts and then expands a
bit more and contracts and

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,230
then expands a bit more.

50
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,130
And it's really important in
attachment that caregivers

51
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,340
stay within close proximity to
that infant, so that the

52
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,350
infant can really see them or
at least know by their voice

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,245
that they're close by.

54
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:51,210
So let's have a look
at an example.

55
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,710
Let's talk about Ben.

56
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,770
He's nine months old, so
he's in phase three.

57
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,690
He's able to crawl.

58
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,940
At this particular stage, he
might be asking through crying

59
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,920
or perhaps through a little bit
of babbling for his mum to

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,760
come over an attend to him.

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,350
Maybe he's hungry.

62
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,840
Maybe he's a little bit just
in need of some attention.

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,180
But his mum, knowing his
particular cues, will go up

64
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,140
and say, oh, you're
hungry, are you?

65
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,540
So she'll pick him up and feed
him, and then pop him down

66
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,239
into his cot for a sleep.

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,760
He falls asleep quite quickly.

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,620
And then when he wakes up, he
sits up and calls out to her.

69
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,450
It's not a distress cry.

70
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,869
It's really just asking,
well, are you there?

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,170
She hears him and goes over
and picks him up and might

72
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,910
hold him for a little while.

73
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,230
And then because Ben's crawling,
he may start to

74
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,320
explore the room around him.

75
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,070
If she moves away, perhaps to
go into another room, she'll

76
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,459
probably tell him
before she goes.

77
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,270
Even though he may not
understand specifically what

78
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,580
she's saying, it's just that
reassuring voice that will

79
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,750
help him to know that she hasn't
disappeared altogether.

80
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,600
If he does call out, she might
even say, oh, hi, Ben.

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,060
Remember?

82
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,550
I'm over here.

83
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,420
And then he'll be able
to just relax and

84
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,350
continue to play and explore.

85
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,807
