https://youtu.be/-NafFbcW1FQ

2
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:14,100
As a child's world expands prior
to actually entering a

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,750
full school system, they may
actually enter a formal early

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,330
childhood setting.

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,279
Now these can take
a range of forms.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,700
Firstly, you might find that
they're placed in an

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,000
occasional care setting,
or what we call a

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,880
limited hours setting.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,530
Limited hours means that they're
only open for two,

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,810
three, four hours a day, and
perhaps only one day a week.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,660
They're often run in a
neighbourhood house, usually

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,569
under some sort of
community banner.

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,620
Then you have what's called
family day care.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,580
Now, family day care is a little
bit different, because

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,810
it's actually run within a
qualified educator's home.

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,000
So there's a limited number of
children, but the environment

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,300
feels very much like
a home setting.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,530
Then we have what's called
a long day care setting.

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,240
And that is, as the name
suggests, they're open for a

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,270
longer period of time, and
they're open five days a week.

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,190
Some can even open at limited
times on the weekend.

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,509
Very much designed for working
parents, and they run very

23
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,910
specific educational programmes
for babies through

24
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,320
to preschoolers.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,830
And then it might be that a
child doesn't go to any of

26
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,060
those particular settings, but
starts their formal early

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,160
childhood education in a
kindergarten environment.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,560
That might be within a long
day care setting, because

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,590
there are kindergarten
programmes out there in long

30
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,730
day care settings, but they're
often what we call sessional

31
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,050
kindergartens.

32
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,899
And you'll see them in
most localities.

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,720
They are sometimes available
for three-year-olds but, in

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,789
general, most children attend
kindergarten when they're four

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,290
or five, moving into before they
actually go to school.

36
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,489
They are also run by qualified
educators, and the programmes

37
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,610
can run for several hours, but
some of them actually run for

38
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,340
extended periods throughout
the day.

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,040
So the children will actually
stay and eat their lunch

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,410
there, and then spend some time
there in the afternoon.

41
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,340
If you're a family planning to
place a child into a formal

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,350
early childhood setting, or if
you're an educator perhaps

43
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,210
thinking to work in an early
childhood setting, it's really

44
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,340
important to do your homework.

45
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,220
I mean there are obvious things
such as the operating

46
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,140
hours, and the fees that they
charge, and the proximity to

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,359
where you live.

48
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,950
But I'd encourage
you to explore a

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,230
bit deeper than that.

50
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,010
Have a think about that
concept of belonging.

51
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,429
When you walk into that service,
do you feel like it's

52
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,280
a place you'd like to be?

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,810
Is it welcoming?

54
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,300
Is it relaxing?

55
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,770
Is it warm?

56
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,210
There are questions that you
can assess as an adult, and

57
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,550
realise that, of course, if
you're going to place your

58
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,330
child in there, if you don't
feel comfortable about it,

59
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,830
then surely enough, your
child won't either.

60
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,740
So it's really important
to do that first

61
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,200
little bit of homework.

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,649
Ask them to talk to you about
their philosophy, and what

63
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,550
they believe is really important
to children.

64
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,020
And then see if you can see the

65
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,190
programme actually running.

66
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,579
Try not to go there in
a time when there's

67
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,860
only one or two children.

68
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,190
Try and get there at a time when
there's a lot happening,

69
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,800
and have a look at the
interactions between the

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,030
educators and the children.

71
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,780
Are they respectful?

72
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,440
Are they engaging?

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,540
Are the educators enjoying,
basically, working with

74
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,400
children, or does it look like
a place where everyone's

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,330
unhappy and just wants
to get home?

76
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,120
Have a think about what the
children are engaged in.

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,945
Do they look as though
they're learning?

78
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:05,750
Are they engaged and absorbed
in the learning process, or

79
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,380
are they just wandering
around, looking for

80
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,760
something to do?

81
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,260
These are really, really
important questions for you to

82
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,560
ask and evaluate before
you take that step.

83
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,490
I'd also encourage you to look
at the outdoor environment,

84
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,360
because as we talked about
before and learning through

85
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,490
play, children learn both
indoors and outdoors.

86
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,240
So make sure there is space for
children to run around,

87
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,490
and to probably engage with
the natural environment as

88
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,920
much as possible.

89
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,300
If you have a really young
infant or toddler, ask them

90
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,190
about how much time those
children get to spend outside,

91
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,180
because it's really important,
as we've discussed, that

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,830
infants are able to engage
with the outdoor

93
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,630
environment as well.

94
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,350
So as a family member, if
you've selected an early

95
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,950
childhood setting, then it's
really important to think

96
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,820
about the transition
of placing your

97
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,760
child into that setting.

98
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,060
It's something we don't
want hurry.

99
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,350
It's really important, first of
all, to talk to your child

100
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,890
about what to expect when
they get to that

101
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,479
early childhood setting.

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,330
Prepare them in advance.

103
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,469
They won't be able to remember
everything that we say, but

104
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,820
you can talk about things
that you know

105
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,400
they're interested in.

106
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,169
So if they're interested in
trucks for instance, you might

107
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,290
talk about the trucks that
they're going to be able to

108
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,550
play with when they get there.

109
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,210
You might talk to them about the
outdoor climbing equipment

110
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,430
that they'll be able to play on
when they get there, so you

111
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,420
create that sense
of anticipation.

112
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,650
On the very first day, don't try
and fall into the trap of

113
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,049
thinking you're just going to
get there, leave your child,

114
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,780
and rush off to wherever
you go.

115
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,440
You actually have to leave
plenty of time to stay with

116
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,510
your child and to allow
them to settle in.

117
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,159
And it might not be a tough
process for them but, you just

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,640
never know.

119
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,030
So it's always good to be
prepared in advance.

120
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,239
If you're an educator, you need
to also understand that

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,430
it's not just difficult for
the child to separate, but

122
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,070
sometimes it's also difficult
for the parent to separate.

123
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,070
They may feel anxious.

124
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,730
After all, it is the first time,
so be confident, engage

125
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,120
with them, and in so doing, the
child will actually sense

126
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,170
that confidence between
the two of you.

127
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,520
Obviously, once the parent has
left then it's your chance to

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,450
actually engage with
that child.

129
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,240
And use a few simple
techniques.

130
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,980
Of course, you comfort them, but
you'd also try to redirect

131
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,850
towards something that they
enjoy doing, which you would

132
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,600
have probably already conferred
with the parents on.

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,430
And you might even just need to
distract them very quickly.

134
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,890
So pick them up, take them over
to the window, and show

135
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,890
them something outside.

136
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,270
Chances are, the family may want
to give you a call and

137
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,690
just make sure everything's
OK, and that's fine.

138
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,719
That's all part of the
transition process.

139
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,790
The main thing is prepare the
children, because from their

140
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,600
point of view, they're emotional
beings, and they

141
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,590
don't necessarily understand
that how I feel when I walk in

142
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,400
the door isn't going to be how
I feel half an hour later.

143
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,299
And they have to actually
learn that.

144
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,850
So understand that they are
emotional, they will react,

145
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,460
and just allow time for that
process to unfold.

146
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,972
