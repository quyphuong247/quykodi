2
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,820
So one of the key ways children

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,260
learn is through play.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,259
Play is how they make sense
of their world.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,350
But how do we really
define play?

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,510
I suppose what we could really
say is that play is something

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,840
that children freely choose,
that engages them, that

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,630
stimulates them, and perhaps is
something that is sustained

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,220
for quite a long
period of time.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,129
And like development,
play tends to move

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,200
in a defined sequence.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,000
So very early on in an infant,
you'll find they're engaged in

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,730
very solitary play.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,260
Perhaps as we saw before, just
looking at their own finger,

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,920
moving on to touching objects,
and then even to manipulating

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,690
objects in more of
a complex way.

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,890
Then they move on to, as
Caitlin was talking, to

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,270
parallel play, where they'll
play alongside each other.

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,750
So you'll see them sitting in
the sandpit, both perhaps

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,470
making sand castles, but
they're not actually

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,130
interacting at all.

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,220
That moves on then further
into the preschool years,

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,150
where play starts to become
more cooperative.

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,310
And you might see children
actually building with blocks,

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,070
and they might be cooperatively

26
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,389
building a city together.

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,050
And then that moves on even
further to a more

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,470
sophisticated level where
children actually engage in

29
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,900
games with rules.

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,690
They're able to follow the rules
and to even question the

31
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,580
rules at certain times.

32
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,039
You'll hear children engaged in
games with rules, and they

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,320
might actually come out with a
comment like, that's not fair.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,770
That's not what the rules say.

35
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,390
So what do children learn
through play?

36
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,280
There are many, many examples.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,830
First of all, they
can discover.

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,740
So for instance, if they paint
some water on the ground and

39
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,650
the sun comes out, they discover
about evaporation.

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,060
They can create.

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,950
They can take a few blobs of
paint, and they can create a

42
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,149
masterpiece from that.

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,980
They learn to improvise.

44
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,730
So a young child will pick up
a pencil, and it might start

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,010
to be a pencil.

46
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,100
But then all of a sudden,
it will become,

47
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,579
say, a fairy wand.

48
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,810
It's a really interesting
learning experience actually

49
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,960
learning to improvise, because
we need to do that a lot in

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,170
our adult lives.

51
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,190
Lives aren't always predictable,
and being able to

52
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,030
be adaptable like that is
something that we can learn

53
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,150
from a very early age.

54
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,260
They also learn a lot
of social skills.

55
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,880
As they interact together, they
learn how to cooperate.

56
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,510
First of all, just to be able to
enter into play with other

57
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,859
children, but then how
to get along and

58
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,940
have that play sustained.

59
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,400
They learn what to do and what
not to do in different social

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,130
situations.

61
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,450
They also have their thinking
challenged, because children

62
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,880
come up with all
sorts of ideas.

63
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,935
I can think of children who say
to me something like, why

64
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:20,270
do things fall down
and not up?

65
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,910
And then when they're playing,
they can actually

66
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,270
experiment with that.

67
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,670
Or they might say something
like, oh, well, rocks will

68
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,579
fall down, but feathers
will fly up.

69
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,820
And that's a really interesting
one, because it

70
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,739
might be that feathers will fall
down on a still day, but

71
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,600
feathers might actually fly
away on a windy day.

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,930
So there's all these sorts
of concepts that they're

73
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,650
discovering in a fairly ad hoc
way, but just through the

74
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,820
course of their own play.

75
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,910
So how do we as adults
support play?

76
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,260
I guess one really important
thing to remember is that

77
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,200
learning through play happens
both indoors and outdoors.

78
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
It's not one or the other.

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
Children will learn concepts
when they're playing indoors,

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,950
and they'll learn concepts
when they're

81
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,429
playing outdoors as well.

82
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,880
Another thing to remind
ourselves of is that don't

83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,440
place our own agenda
on children's play.

84
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,529
Allow them to control the
play for themselves.

85
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,060
After all, it is supposed to
be engaging and challenging

86
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,670
and enriching for them.

87
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,340
And if we always have a goal in
mind of what we want them

88
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,739
to achieve, then does
that really

89
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,210
constitute play for them?

90
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,859
I think it's also important to
make sure that we give them

91
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,540
time, because play, because it's
engaging and because it's

92
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,030
engrossing, sometimes children
will actually become involved

93
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,580
in it for quite long
periods of time.

94
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,090
And if we're in a hurry to go
and get things done, we often

95
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,750
interrupt that flow that
children move into when

96
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,310
they're engrossed
in their play.

97
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,920
Another thing we can do on a
positive note is to resource

98
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,940
their play.

99
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,450
So if they need things to sort
of enrich the experiences that

100
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,130
we have, we can provide
that for them.

101
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,350
So I'm thinking about children
perhaps maybe building a city

102
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,700
out of blocks, and we might
decide that we can bring in

103
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,450
some cars that can actually
drive along the

104
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,120
road in that city.

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,100
Or we might bring in a train
track so that there's a train

106
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,700
line going in along
the city as well.

107
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,599
And we might even have some
little toy people that can

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,310
actually drive the train and can
actually be waiting to hop

109
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,240
on the train or waiting
to hop on a taxi.

110
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,020
And then we can also
ask some questions.

111
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,500
We can actually lead the play
and support the play without

112
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,700
really controlling it, but
just actually making it a

113
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,330
little bit more enriched.

114
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,740
So we might say, I wonder where
the people who hop off

115
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,320
the train, I wonder if they need
to go and buy anything.

116
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,170
And we might find then that
children start to create a

117
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,590
shopping centre.

118
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,560
So as you can see from one
simple thing, just from a few

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,950
simple blocks and a little bit
of extra resourcing and a few

120
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,159
leading questions,
we can actually

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,850
support children's play.

122
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,650
And what we'll find is that
they can be engaged in an

123
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,900
activity like that, particularly
preschoolers, for

124
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,780
a very extended length of time.

125
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,965
