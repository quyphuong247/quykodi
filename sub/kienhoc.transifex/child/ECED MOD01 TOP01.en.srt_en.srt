00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,220
Welcome to the world of early
childhood education.

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,220
We're going to be exploring
children's development and

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,439
learning, specifically from
the years birth to five.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,390
My name's Caitlin and this is
Helen, and we're both early

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,560
childhood consultants
representing Gowrie Victoria.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,629
We're going to be sharing
the delivery of

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,160
this subject to you.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,449
What we'll be discussing is
the world of children.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,690
And we'll be looking at
how they develop a

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,879
strong sense of belonging.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,880
We'll be looking at how
we support them to

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,160
be free, to be children.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,739
And we'll look at how we can
also support them to become

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,430
all they potentially can be.

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,080
In this module, we'll be
focusing on the uniqueness of

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,390
children, and how all children
develop differently.

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,620
We'll have a look at some
of those influences on

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,730
development.

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,509
So we'll have a look at the
genetics that a child's born

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,510
with, but also who they're born
to, so their family, who

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,060
are the first big influence
in their lives.

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,330
We'll go further and we'll have
a look at the influence

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,710
of extended family and friends,
and then we'll look

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,669
at the influence of community,
neighbourhood, and early

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,150
childhood settings.

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,440
The uniqueness of children is
something to celebrate.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,830
And so it's from this viewpoint
that we'll explore

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,090
the world of children.

30
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,300
We're not sure if you've
discovered the discussion

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,960
forum yet, but I encourage you
to jump on there and to share

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,380
with others the reason
why you selected

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,630
to study this subject.

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,683
