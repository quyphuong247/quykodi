2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,100
Let's look at empathy
and compassion.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,850
Infants and young toddlers
show very early signs of

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,210
empathy and compassion through
some of those reciprocal

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,510
behaviours that we talked
about in earlier topics.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,280
This is like, for instance,
when one baby will hear

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,200
another baby cry, so that
baby will start crying.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,580
Or perhaps, a toddler will see
their friend trip over and

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,210
hurt themselves, so the toddler
will become distressed

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,210
as well on their behalf.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,860
So although this isn't really
fully formed empathy and

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,800
compassion--

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,640
because at this age, there's
still very much an egocentric

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,520
feeling going on where the world
revolves around them--

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,620
these are the very early
stages of empathy and

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,790
compassion.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,530
Young children innately want
to be helpful, and they're

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,990
looking at ways that they can
contribute to other people's

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,140
well-being.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,510
So it's important that we foster
these interactions with

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,240
young children through those
early stages of attachment and

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,830
reciprocity in order for them
to then continue to develop

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,990
empathy and compassion and
pro-social behaviours.

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,500
So what are pro-social
behaviours?

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,620
These are behaviours that are
exhibited when we want to get

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,730
along well with people and form
positive and reciprocal

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,210
relationships.

28
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,059
So these types of behaviours
would include sharing, being

29
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,780
able to share your toys or
share the attention of an

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,260
adult in your life.

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,860
This is an important pro-social
behaviour.

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,080
Cooperating, so being able to
work together on tasks,

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,039
perhaps to achieve
a common goal.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,100
Helping.

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,750
You'll see a lot of young
children wanting to do this--

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,660
helping out, assisting adults,
maybe helping set the table or

37
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,990
put things away at the
end of the day.

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,080
And lastly, looking
at sympathy.

39
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,580
Sympathy is about feeling for
somebody else when they're

40
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,990
going through something.

41
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,850
So sympathy, you might see
toddlers putting their arm

42
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,100
around someone when
they're upset.

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,359
In order to demonstrate
pro-social behaviours, we do

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,420
need to be able to understand
other people's social cues,

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,790
and this does depend on each
child's developmental stage.

46
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,670
Lastly, when discussing empathy
and compassion, let's

47
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,600
talk about something called
theory of mind.

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,180
This begins to develop in
children at around about the

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,850
age of 2 to 3, and it's when
children develop an awareness

50
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,070
that there are other people who
think differently to them.

51
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,560
That, in fact, they're
individual.

52
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,990
Their thoughts and feelings
are individual, and other

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,540
people have different
perspectives.

54
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,570
Children can then start to
think about how their own

55
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,700
emotions may affect other people
or their own behaviours

56
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,369
may affect other people.

57
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,700
So you can see it's a very
important part of their

58
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,109
cognitive development and
emotional development that

59
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,970
then supports them developing
empathy and compassion for

60
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,270
other people.

61
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,810
In this last module,
we've covered

62
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,430
various aspects of belonging.

63
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,890
And in the next module, Helen
will talk about being and what

64
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,630
it means to just be a child.

65
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,088
