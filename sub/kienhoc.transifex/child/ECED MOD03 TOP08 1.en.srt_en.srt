00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,440
So we've come to the final
topic in this module.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,259
We've talked about being,
about being

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,420
free to be a child.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,040
So let's recap.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,590
What do infants and toddlers
and preschoolers

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,790
need from us as adults?

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,799
So I'm an infant.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,750
What do I need from you?

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,920
Well, I need you to
be there for me,

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,830
because I depend on you.

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:41,560
When I call out, I need you
to come and answer for me.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,700
I need you to tune in, because
I need you to understand if

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,740
I'm hungry or whether I'm tired
or whether I'm in pain.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,100
I really need you to love me,
because how can I develop

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,870
trust if you don't love me and
show me the affections that's

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,519
just so vital for
my well-being?

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,490
And I also need you to
interpret for me.

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,570
If you take me somewhere and
you hand me over to someone

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,940
else, talk to them about
what I need.

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,350
Try and even explain to them
about why I'm crying, so that

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,429
when you're gone, I feel safe
and supported and secure until

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,270
you return again.

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,369
So I'm a toddler.

25
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,400
What do I need from you?

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,580
Well, I need you to understand
me, because I can understand a

27
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,480
lot more than I can say.

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,000
But sometimes I need you
to interpret for me.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,450
So if I say &quot;woof,&quot; I'm really
trying to tell you about the

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,580
dog I saw in the park, and I
need you to go back through

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,330
that and help me find the
language to explain that.

32
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,140
I need you to be patient with
me, because I can't really

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,030
control myself at the moment.

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,020
I get frustrated, and I
get angry, and I want

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,750
things to go my way.

36
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,170
And I get really upset
when they don't.

37
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,520
And sometimes I just get
excited, because even though

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,210
I'm supposed to be behaving in
a particular way, I'm just

39
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,619
having lots of fun.

40
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,910
And I need you to be patient
with me and teach me the right

41
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,130
way to behave at
certain times.

42
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,390
I need you to let me explore.

43
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,890
I'm an investigator.

44
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,279
I like to discover.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,250
I'm so curious.

46
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,500
I want to know about the
world out there.

47
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,590
I want to go and jump
in a puddle and

48
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,420
feel my feet get wet.

49
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,649
I want to be able to understand
different things

50
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,210
that I don't know
about as yet.

51
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,110
And I also want you to
help me, because I'm

52
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,230
learning from you.

53
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,560
You're my role model, and I'm
imitating what you do.

54
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,860
So let me be a bit like you.

55
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,360
And I'm a preschooler.

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,300
What do I need from you?

57
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,410
I need you to know that I'm
capable, that I want to

58
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,820
self-direct my own learning.

59
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,140
I'm curious.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,380
And I want you to ask me
questions, but I don't always

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,840
want you to give
me the answers.

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,480
I want to discover things
for myself.

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,010
I want to be able to go out
there and feel like I'm in

64
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,810
charge of my own learning--

65
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,800
not all the time, but
a lot of the time.

66
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,350
Because, you see, I want to
master things, and that means

67
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,850
I need to practise.

68
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,980
I need to do things over and
over again until I really feel

69
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,530
like I've accomplished them.

70
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,680
Because when I get that sense of
mastery, that's when I feel

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,420
good about myself.

72
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,780
And I really need you
to encourage me.

73
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,320
Because even though I've got
lots of words, and I'm almost

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,530
able to do lots and lots of
things that you can do, I'm

75
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,850
still learning how
to do them well.

76
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,570
So don't push me too hard, but
let me be a child still.

77
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,989
You see, regardless of my age, I
need you to allow me to be a

78
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,330
child, because I'm going
to grow up soon enough.

79
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,965
