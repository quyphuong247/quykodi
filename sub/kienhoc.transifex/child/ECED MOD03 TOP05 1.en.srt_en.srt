00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,970
One of the great things about
being free to be a child is to

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,400
be able to use your
imagination.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,740
And what is that?

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,890
Well really, in simple terms,
the imagination is taking

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,730
nothing and making something
of it, or even in a child's

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,350
case, they become someone
that they're not.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,230
And they do this often
in their play.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,710
You'll see children take
on particular roles.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,530
They may be, for instance, as in
this picture here, they may

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,600
be actually riding the rapids.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,040
They might be a canoeist,
riding the

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,750
rapids down the river.

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,260
They could be actually baking
a wedding cake.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,839
Or they might even be acting out
their role, and pretending

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,190
that they're a parent.

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,930
And through this they learn
to understand reality by

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,200
projecting themselves into
another place, or into

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,440
somebody else's shoes.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,268
So why is that important?

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,900
Well, basically, if we can't
imagine, we can't really ever

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,910
create anything new.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,810
Because in many cases, to be
able to create something new,

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,800
we have to be able to first of
all imagine it, see it in our

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,350
mind's eye, and then actually
create something from nothing.

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,660
If the child dabbles with a blob
of paint and then puts it

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,140
onto a canvas or onto some
paper, in their mind they're

28
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,830
creating a masterpiece.

29
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,890
We might not be even able to
recognise what that is, but in

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,650
their mind, they've created
a masterpiece.

31
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,110
If they bring some blocks
together, they can create a

32
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,610
massive tower.

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,850
But creativity is not all about
art and construction, it

34
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,820
can also relate to
problem-solving.

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,979
You've probably faced an event
in your life where you've had

36
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,390
to meet a deadline.

37
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,140
And even though you thought
you'd never actually make it,

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,120
somehow you found the resources
to get the job done.

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,039
And that takes creative
thinking, and it takes the

40
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,299
ability to problem solve.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,650
If you have a look at this
picture here, these boys have

42
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,860
discovered a way, and they've
created a way, of capturing

43
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,260
water as they poured
it down the pipe.

44
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,450
So instead of it all filtering
through to the ground and

45
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,530
disappearing, they've actually
made a connection and they've

46
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,520
actually created something
that will

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,510
actually work for them.

48
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,709
It's a definite example
of problem solving.

49
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,360
So if imagination and creativity
is so individual

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,460
for a child, how can we, as
an adult, support that?

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,190
It's really quite simple.

52
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,980
Give them lots and lots of
what we call open-ended

53
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,910
materials, something
that doesn't

54
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,790
have a definite ending.

55
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,340
So a group of rocks is
a simple example

56
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,710
of open-ended material.

57
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,690
We don't know exactly what
the child would do

58
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,040
with that set of rocks.

59
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,900
They might put them in a
line and count them.

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,830
They may create a picture
from them.

61
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,510
They might try to stack them up,
one on top of the other.

62
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,810
We just don't know.

63
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,210
But it's more important to look
at the process that the

64
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,290
child is going through than
the actual result.

65
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,079
I guess another important thing
to remember is to allow

66
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,130
them uninterrupted time.

67
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,970
We talked about that, about
getting into flow.

68
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,450
Allow that process to unfold,
and not hurry children through

69
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,950
and get them to end up with
something quickly.

70
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,339
Let them have that time
to actually create for

71
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,730
themselves.

72
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,690
Children will look
at alternative

73
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,280
ways of using things.

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,180
They don't always use equipment
and tools in the

75
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,630
same way that we would, but it
doesn't really matter because

76
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,060
it's in the experimentation that
they discover many things

77
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,030
that they didn't know before.

78
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,100
So as an adult, we can really
support that imagination and

79
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,190
creativity which is really
fundamental.

80
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,640
We don't want the world
tomorrow to be

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,399
exactly like it is today.

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,042
