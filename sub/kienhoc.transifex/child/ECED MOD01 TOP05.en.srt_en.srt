00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,500
In this topic we'll talk about
preschoolers and child

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,690
development.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,509
Preschoolers are children who
are aged between three and

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,990
five years.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,020
Let's start with cognitive
development for preschoolers.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,240
We'll start to see their
thinking development become

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,840
more complex in this
age group.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,130
So things like simple
mathematics, counting will

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,560
become of interest.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,530
You'll see children looking for
patterns or lining things

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,900
up in patterns or in sequence.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,310
They'll be thinking about
space and measurement.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,330
And they'll also be thinking
about things like sorting and

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,050
colour coding.

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,330
So you might see them with
blocks, putting all the same

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,480
blocks into different piles.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,180
This is all about that type of
mathematical thinking that's

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,450
going on, or logical
thinking for them

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,180
during this age group.

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,500
Another part of cognitive
development that's occurring

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,730
for preschoolers is an
improvement in their memory.

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,919
So you'll see that preschoolers
can start to

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,940
follow instructions that
have more than one

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,970
or two simple steps.

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,260
It may be still a simple
instruction, but it will have

27
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,670
more parts to it.

28
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,420
So for instance, rather than
just, can you go and get your

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,090
shoes, you might hear somebody
saying to a preschooler, can

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,190
you go and get your shoes and
then bring them back here?

31
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,800
Then we're going to put
them in your bag

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,450
before we go outside.

33
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,670
And this isn't too much
information for them to

34
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,720
follow, because their memory has
developed to that point.

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,910
This is also the age group
where children

36
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,720
start to role play.

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,730
Role play is when they
decide to be somebody

38
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,450
that they're not.

39
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,390
But it's usually somebody that
they know or they've seen.

40
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,810
So you might see them acting out
a family member, perhaps a

41
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,120
superhero, or even someone from
the community, like a

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,540
police officer.

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,820
And they'll use props and
dress-ups in order to do this.

44
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,660
This is a big part of their
cognitive development, trying

45
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,590
on different roles to see if
they can understand them.

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,920
Let's look now at physical
development for preschoolers.

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,660
Preschoolers are really
beginning to master their

48
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,289
gross motor skills.

49
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,210
So you'll see they're not only
running and running fast, but

50
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,220
they're also able to
stop and start

51
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,930
with a lot more accuracy.

52
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,770
And they can weave
around obstacles.

53
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,240
They'll also be able to ride a
bike, but probably a tricycle

54
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,690
at this stage, and jump.

55
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,250
Their fine motor
skills are also

56
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,330
developing at a great rate.

57
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,040
You'll see them able to do
things like thread beads onto

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,459
a string and hold objects like
a crayon or a pen with a lot

59
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,400
more dexterity than before.

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,100
They'll also start to perform
more self-hygiene practises,

61
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,900
like combing their own hair or
brushing their teeth or even

62
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,710
washing their hands.

63
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,900
Let's look at social and
emotional development for

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,700
preschoolers.

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,859
In this age group you'll see a
lot more prosocial behaviours

66
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,070
begin, because preschoolers
are very interested now in

67
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,730
playing with other children.

68
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,859
So their play starts to become
more constructive and

69
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,990
collaborative.

70
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,950
They'll take on roles
in games.

71
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,940
They'll have more rules
in their games.

72
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,440
And they'll be interested
in what each other

73
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,770
thinks of each other.

74
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,020
So you'll see them playing much
more together than before

75
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,300
when it was more a parallel
play or solo play.

76
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,790
Preschoolers really enjoy
being praised.

77
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,820
And they'll do a lot of things
like tasks in order to get

78
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,370
good feedback from the adults
in their lives.

79
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,190
But they're very happy with
themselves as well.

80
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,510
So you'll often see them
being boastful.

81
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,670
They'll say things like, I can
run really fast, or, I'm the

82
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,190
fastest runner.

83
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,820
And you'll often
hear, watch me!

84
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,049
Watch me!, as they do things.

85
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,630
So when we deal with
preschoolers, it's important

86
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,950
to remember that they think
they are the best at

87
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,489
everything.

88
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,980
And why shouldn't they be?

89
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,399
Lastly, let's have a look at
language development for

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,650
preschoolers.

91
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,030
Their language is becoming
a lot more complex.

92
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,740
And you'll hear them having
longer conversations with each

93
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,620
other and with adults.

94
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,270
They're are also developing
more writing skills.

95
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,800
And they'll be practicing these
on a regular basis.

96
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,860
It's something that
they enjoy to do.

97
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,360
And you'll be able to decipher
those letters a lot more

98
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,830
readily than before.

99
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,180
They're also developing better
skills in using grammar and

100
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,050
tense, and their sentences
become longer.

101
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,209
So like our previous
example where a

102
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,690
toddler would say, park?

103
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,890
to mean, can we go to the park?,
a preschooler will say,

104
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,330
can we go to the park today?

105
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,500
OK, so now that we've had a
look at the four different

106
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,260
areas of development for
children, Helen's going to

107
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,430
explore how children
learn through play.

108
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,927
