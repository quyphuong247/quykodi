Hi, I'm Caitlin.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,710
I'm an early childhood
consultant

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,880
representing Gowrie Victoria.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,700
In this topic.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,900
I'm going to be talking about
moral development.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,479
What are morals?

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,500
Morals can be thought of as the
standards of behaviour or

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,250
beliefs concerning what is
acceptable and what isn't

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,090
acceptable.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,560
Perhaps morals can be thought
of as guiding us to what is

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,560
right and what is wrong.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,630
So an example of this might
be, in our society, we

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,340
consider stealing to be wrong,
because it's taking something

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,880
away from someone else.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,300
Moral development for children
is very important, because

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,290
it's part of their ongoing
emotional development, and

18
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,220
it's also about how they are
learning to be active and

19
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,480
positive members of
their community.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,949
Let's talk about toddlers
and moral development.

21
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,130
Toddlers have a very black and
white way of seeing things, so

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,050
they're very concerned with
consequences, and they're

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,570
often driven by rules.

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,139
An example of this might be that
toddlers are aware that

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,910
they shouldn't break things.

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,470
However, they can't discern
between breaking something on

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,750
purpose and breaking something
by accident.

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,830
They'll consider something
being broken as being the

29
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,000
wrong thing.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,150
As adults, we can support
toddlers by being positive

31
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,080
role models and modeling the
behaviour that we expect to

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,330
see from them.

33
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,880
We also need to provide lots of
opportunities for them to

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,229
be social and learn about the
cultural norms and values that

35
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,900
are in their society.

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,500
In later childhood, children
start to begin to understand

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,990
the intent behind actions,
as well as what the

38
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,860
consequences are.

39
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,250
They'll think about
the context in

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,540
which something happens.

41
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,820
So if we think about the example
of something breaking

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,050
again, an older child might
think about whether it was an

43
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,750
accident when it occurred,
or whether

44
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,030
it was done on purpose.

45
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,620
And then they'll expect the
consequences to follow that

46
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,010
will relate to what the intent
was behind the action in the

47
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,240
first place.

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,809
As adults, we can support older
children and their moral

49
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,990
development by discussing moral
issues with them and

50
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,519
looking at different views that
occur within society.

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,520
We need to focus on children's
strengths and also focus on

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,140
empathy and compassion.

53
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,869
And this way, children will have
a positive development

54
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,190
morally as they grow.

55
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,380
A child's understanding of what
is right and wrong really

56
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,290
depends on where they're up
to with their cognitive

57
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,760
development, so that's the
development of their thinking

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,269
capabilities.

59
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,500
So we've seen those different
age groups.

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,870
There's a different
understanding of

61
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,290
what's right and wrong.

62
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,700
So for toddlers, we talked about
it being a very black

63
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,690
and white issue.

64
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,770
It's either right
or it's wrong.

65
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,050
Whereas as children get a little
older, they can start

66
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,770
thinking about the intent behind
what's happened and

67
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,680
what context it occurred in.

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,320
And as children get a little
older, they start to develop a

69
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,310
conscience.

70
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,060
They think about what it is that
they've done, whether it

71
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,810
was the right thing
to do or not.

72
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,380
And they may feel bad if they've
done something that's

73
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,960
not considered to be
the right thing.

74
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,940
Let's have a look at this
sequence of pictures.

75
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,630
Here we can see two girls who
would be toddler age, and

76
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,760
they're interacting.

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,470
One child's holding a glass
up to the other child.

78
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,100
She may have even spilled
some juice on her.

79
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,980
And by the end picture, you
can see that the glass may

80
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,310
have been dropped.

81
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,850
These two girls are having a lot
of fun at the table, and

82
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,400
they don't think that
their behaviour

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,070
is necessarily wrong.

84
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,650
In fact, it isn't, and it's
important as adults that we

85
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,670
react appropriately to these
kinds of situations.

86
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,160
So what you've seen is a fun,
maybe getting a little bit

87
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,410
overexcited interaction that's
ended with the glass dropping

88
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,600
on the floor.

89
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,390
But if we were to react and
say that they've done

90
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,190
something wrong and make them
feel bad about it, then this

91
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,440
is going to make them develop
a conscience that carries a

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,590
lot of guilt as opposed to
perhaps guiding them in a

93
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,250
positive way to change
their behaviours.

94
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,340
It's always important that we
understand the different

95
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,870
developmental levels that
children are at if we're going

96
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,320
to be supporting their behaviour
appropriately.

97
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,160
Otherwise, our expectations
may be unfair.

98
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,940
We should use a strengths
approach, always coming at

99
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,690
things from a positive angle,
and ensure that when we're

100
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,100
helping children develop an
understanding of right and

101
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,390
wrong, we're making sure that
they feel good about

102
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,640
themselves.

103
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,260
