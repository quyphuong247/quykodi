00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:12,760
So how to cope with [INAUDIBLE]
for children when

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,420
they're playing indoors?

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,379
I think a simple principle
to bear in

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,560
mind is keep it simple.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,939
Keep it open-ended, and make
sure that we allow children to

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,110
engage in play according to what
interests them, rather

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,160
than trying to control
it for ourselves.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,990
So I'm thinking about
a toddler.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,870
You know, there's nothing more
exciting than an open kitchen

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,760
cupboard, and being able to pull
out all the pots and all

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,629
the cooking equipment, and
create a drum, or to discover

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,850
how one container will fit
inside another one.

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,070
Those are sort of open-ended,
very exciting, and very

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,990
adventurous exploration
for a toddler.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,770
Though it might be difficult,
I recall back to when I was

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,900
raising my children,
and how my linen

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,050
cupboard was always empty.

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,801
And I'd find, as I went into
the room where they were

20
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:09,260
playing, that all of a sudden,
they'd created a tent, and

21
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,660
that they were actually sitting
underneath that tent,

22
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,570
and they were out camping out
in the bush, as far as they

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,690
were concerned.

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,420
So it's about being flexible,
and it's about letting

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,380
children use everyday things
to create something for

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,330
themselves.

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,580
We don't need to spend a lot
of money on expensive toys.

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,009
I invite you to bring the
outdoors inside, particularly

29
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,010
if children are spending
a lot of time indoors.

30
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,560
Bring in some plants.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,210
Allow them to go outside and
make a collection of rocks.

32
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,210
If you visit the beach, find
some shells that you can

33
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,429
actually bring back, and make
collections of natural things.

34
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,780
Very important for children, if
they are spending a lot of

35
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,780
time indoors, that they do
connect with the natural

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,940
environment.

37
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,990
If you're working in an early
childhood setting, obviously,

38
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,690
you will be designing your
programmes so that they're

39
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,730
developmentally appropriate.

40
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,010
Do they reflect the cultures
of the families and the

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,650
children that you're actually
working with?

42
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,830
Important to embrace all people
to get that sense of

43
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,850
inclusion, so that families
and children have that

44
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,780
combined sense of belonging
in your programme.

45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,360
You might also want to have a
think about the literature

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,710
that you select.

47
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,900
Many of our children's books are
based on, for instance, a

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,320
lot of stories will have
your nuclear family.

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,560
So you have mom, and you have
dad, and you have one or two

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,270
children, but that's not the
reality for lots of families

51
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,360
these days.

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,600
Some children live in a
single-parent family.

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,540
Some children live in a very
large, blended family.

54
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,730
Some children have
same sex parents.

55
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,420
So we need to be mindful of the
fact that if we're only

56
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,790
showing them one way through
our literature, that we're

57
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,260
actually excluding them from
what is their reality.

58
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,549
So whether you're a parent or an
educator, it's critical to

59
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,770
remember that we cannot control
what children learn.

60
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,900
We can offer, we can provide
resources for them to

61
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,560
stimulate their play,
but we can't really

62
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,850
control what they learn.

63
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,370
And I like to use the term,
invitations for learning,

64
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,950
because what that means to me is
that we can have a goal in

65
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,299
mind of what we think children
will learn, but through our

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,170
resources, we actually invite
them to learn that.

67
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,660
But it's up to them whether they
RSVP or not, or whether

68
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,790
they actually learn
anything at all.

69
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,799
So it's out of our control.

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,780
We might give a child a lovely,
fancy toy that we've

71
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,640
spent a lot of money on, and,
lo and behold, they're more

72
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,109
interested in the box that
the toy comes from.

73
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,580
And that's what happens
with children.

74
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,460
You never really, really know
how they'll respond to the

75
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,720
invitations for learning
that we offer them.

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,043
