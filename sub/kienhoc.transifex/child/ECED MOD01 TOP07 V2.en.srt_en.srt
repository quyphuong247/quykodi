00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,900
In this topic, we're going to
look at what children learn

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,410
from other people.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,320
So in particular, we'll be
looking at what children learn

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,700
from their families, what they
learn from their peers or

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,520
other children, and what they
learn from other adults in

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,630
their lives.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,640
So we'll begin by looking at
children and their families.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,830
Families are probably the most
influential and the first role

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,860
models that children will
have in their lives.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,460
Children learn about who they
are and where they belong in

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,580
the world from their families.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,890
They'll learn about values and
beliefs, because their

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,220
families will impact
these to them.

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,190
And they'll learn about
boundaries and rules as well,

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,510
so what's acceptable and what
isn't, not only in their own

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,150
home, but also in society.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,330
They'll learn some very simple
things, such as table manners,

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,589
how to wash their hands, how to
be nice to other people as

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,840
well, because families will
teach about empathy and

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,890
compassion and looking
after each other.

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,720
So you can see how important a
family is for a child as far

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,960
as it being the most influential
of the role models

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,770
that they'll have as
their growing up.

25
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,940
Children also learn from their
peers, so that is they learn

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,450
from other children.

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,660
This is really important for
their social and emotional

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,929
development, so it's important
that we give them the

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,950
opportunity to be able to play
with and interact with other

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,030
children as they're
growing up.

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,080
Some of the things that they'll
learn is give and

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,710
take, so being able to give
assistance, but also being

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,350
able to ask for it and
receive it back.

34
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,640
They'll collaborate and
cooperate, so these are

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,760
important things to learn.

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,960
And they'll learn to get along,
even sometimes when the

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,800
situation doesn't suit
them entirely.

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,560
Children also learn about
themselves through their

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,950
interactions with their peers,
because they get to know what

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,840
other children think
about them.

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,640
So they'll understand how their
behaviours reflect on

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,460
themselves and how other
children respond to their

43
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,350
behaviours.

44
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,400
So this is good in teaching them
about who they are, about

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,670
their identity, and also about
empathy and compassion.

46
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,149
Last of all, let's talk about
what children learn from other

47
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,950
adults in their lives.

48
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,730
Other adults might be other
family, like extended family,

49
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,799
or friends, or perhaps they're
adults who are educators or

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,430
carers in an early childhood
setting.

51
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,670
One of the more important things
that children will

52
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,179
learn from other adults is
cultural competence, so this

53
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,930
is an understanding and
acceptance and also a

54
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,650
celebration of the diversity
that there is in society.

55
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,000
When there are other adults in
children's lives, they'll be

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,650
bringing with them naturally
other cultures, other beliefs,

57
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,990
and other values.

58
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,190
This exposure to this is great
for children, because then

59
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,810
they grow up with an acceptance
of such a varied

60
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,850
society of people, and it
makes them a lot more

61
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,290
accepting of culture
in general.

62
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,620
Some other things they can learn
from other adults would

63
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,320
include consequences and
boundaries, but particularly

64
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,060
that when there is an action,
there's generally a reaction.

65
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,360
So I think in particular in an
early childhood setting, other

66
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,175
adults will be telling them
about how when you do this,

67
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,680
this is what occurs.

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,850
These are the consequences.

69
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,890
Finally, other adults
in children's

70
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,910
lives are role models.

71
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,000
So let's think of an example
of how an adult might be a

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,770
role model for a child.

73
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,450
Perhaps a child is spending
a lot of time with their

74
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,730
grandparents, so they're the
other adults in their lives.

75
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,299
And every Sunday morning, the
grandfather gets the newspaper

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,660
and sits at the table
and reads this.

77
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,359
So it's demonstrating an
appreciation for literacy to

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,970
the child, so you might find
that the child then wants to

79
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,570
copy this behaviour and imitate
their grandfather.

80
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,260
So that role modelling is such
an important part of what

81
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,829
other adults can do for children
as they develop.

82
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,085
