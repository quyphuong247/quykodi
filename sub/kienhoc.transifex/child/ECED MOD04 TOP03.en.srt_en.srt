2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,390
When we look at the concept of
becoming, we often talk about

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,930
who a child will become,
what career

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,000
they're go to move into.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,170
And there's a little bit of a
myth that all of us are going

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,520
to be academic, that we're going
to be good with words or

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,570
good with numbers.

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,430
But that's not really the case,
because in this modern

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,720
world, we have so many different
roles that people

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,310
can move into.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,500
There's a concept called
multiple intelligences, and

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,290
I'm going to explain how that
unfolds in a minute.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,430
But just what I want to just
talk about just briefly is

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,560
that we tend to learn
in different ways.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,010
And some of us are good at

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,830
listening and asking questions.

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,800
Some of this learn really
well from reading.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,150
Some of us learn very well from
actually being involved

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,370
and doing what we need to do.

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,459
There's different ways that we
learn, just as the ways that

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,820
we learn unfold into different
intelligences.

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,490
So what are these spheres
of intelligence?

23
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,600
Well, let's look at
the first one.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,080
We have what's called
verbal/linguistic, and these

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,789
are children that are really
good with words and languages.

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,710
And you would expect that these
children may grow up to

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,780
become perhaps writers, or they
may perhaps become in a

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,550
more specific field such as the
law, where they're using

29
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,870
their words and their language
to convince and to move people

30
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,000
in a certain direction.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Logico/mathematical
intelligence--

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,960
that's when children are
actually good with numbers and

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,979
patterns and diagrams.

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,310
These children are often great
investigators, and they

35
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,410
question the world.

36
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,310
They ask a lot of
questions of it.

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,560
And so they're looking at
patterns, but they're also

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,620
looking at differences
in patterns.

39
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,500
So perhaps you might find
children like this develop an

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,920
interest in the sciences, or
perhaps even in philosophy

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,240
where they're questioning things
and what's going on in

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,638
their world a lot.

43
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,240
Visual intelligence--

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,120
this is also related to
spatial intelligence.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,020
So children who have this type
of intelligence see things in

46
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,160
three dimensions quite easily,
and they're the sorts of

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,650
children that become
great constructors.

48
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,590
Perhaps later as they
grow up, they

49
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,010
might become an architect.

50
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,890
Or they might actually become
a sculptor, so that they can

51
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,260
actually envisage something
before they

52
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,790
actually create it.

53
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,329
And then there's musical
intelligence, children that

54
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,100
are constantly the entertainer
in the family.

55
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,234
And they have a strong sense
of rhythm and music, and so

56
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:44,990
they'll be the sorts of children
that perhaps later in

57
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,800
life move into the performing
arts as musicians.

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,170
Or maybe they move into
perhaps even comedy as

59
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,440
entertainers.

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,859
And so these spheres continue.

61
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,310
We have what's called
body/kinesthetic intelligence,

62
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,260
and that's the children who
really love to move.

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,579
They like to do things
on their feet.

64
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,810
They actually think when
they're moving

65
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,890
a lot of the time.

66
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,920
And you'll find that these
children perhaps develop a

67
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,959
propensity for dance.

68
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,080
They may even become
an athlete.

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,170
They may even, if they're
intricate in their movements,

70
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,049
they may even become a very,
very skilled surgeon.

71
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,200
We have interpersonal
intelligence, and these are

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,399
the children that have natural
empathy, that are concerned

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,580
about other people's feelings,
and they're interested in

74
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,760
motivation.

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,420
And so you often find children
moving into careers such as

76
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,089
counselling or into the ministry
or perhaps take on

77
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,710
the role of a teacher.

78
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,390
Then the final one is
intrapersonal intelligence,

79
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,829
which is people who are perhaps
a little bit more

80
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,940
self-reflective, and they really
enjoy their own time.

81
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,460
They like solitude.

82
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,760
And so they move into careers
where they are able to

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,620
actually spend a lot of time on
their own rather than those

84
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,410
careers where they have to
do a lot of exchanges

85
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,950
and work in a team.

86
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,280
We're all very different.

87
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,440
And the thing is that it's
important to understand that

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,410
we offer children a range of
experiences, and we allow them

89
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,790
to move into the area that
they naturally flow into.

90
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,083
