2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,140
So why do we need to take
our children outdoors?

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,020
I mean, it's a potentially
scary place.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,759
A baby crawling across the grass
could put something in

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,810
their mouth.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,930
The children can fall
from great heights.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,280
They might get dirty.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,670
They might get wet.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,500
But that's all really important
for children to have

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,780
those sensory experiences.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,150
If you think back to the
developing brain, it's through

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,610
seeing and hearing and touching
and smelling that a

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,200
baby actually starts to make
some of those connections.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,430
Toddlers are great
investigators.

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,080
They want to go out and
explore the world.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,640
And through that, they're
building those building blocks

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,500
of knowledge, one after the
other, until they can start to

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,890
understand much more complex
ideas and concepts.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,595
For preschoolers, it's a place
to go out and master, to run

20
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:09,100
and to climb and to learn
how to bounce higher

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,570
and higher each time.

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,830
It's a place for really
unstructured play, and that's

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,399
a really important thing.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,800
We don't want to go out there
with our children and make

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,789
them be involved in games with
rules all of the time.

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,100
Just let them be.

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,429
Let them have time just to run
as fast as they can and fall

28
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,900
over and get up again.

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,420
Children need to be outdoors
just as much as they need to

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,430
be indoors.

31
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,300
It's important for them, not
only for those sensory

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,080
experiences, but for
their own physical

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,960
activity and well being.

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,339
But the outdoors isn't all about
just running around.

35
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,010
If you watch children, you'll
see that they often stop and

36
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,500
examine things outdoors in the
most minutest of detail.

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
I think about a child who might
be watching a butterfly

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,260
that's hovering overhead
and is perhaps going

39
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,140
to land on a flower.

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,380
One of the things that the child
will do is to sit very

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,490
quietly, because they've
discovered that if they move

42
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,770
too fast, they'll frighten
the butterfly away.

43
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,700
They'll watch it as it hovers
over, and then they'll watch

44
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,679
it very, very intently as
it just stops and lands.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,640
And then, they'll probably
examine its wings, the colour,

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,089
and the patterns.

47
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,640
And then, of course, if they
do jump up, they'll realise

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,450
that the butterfly will be
frightened and fly away.

49
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,109
You see, the outdoors is a rich
and fascinating world for

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,590
any child of any age.

51
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,212
