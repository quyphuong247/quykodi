00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,879
In this topic, we're going
to be exploring child

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,890
development.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,670
What's does it mean, and
why is it important?

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,030
We can begin with
a definition.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,040
So development refers to the
biological and emotional

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,299
changes that occur as
human beings grow.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,680
Let's look at childhood
development

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,259
in these four areas.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,030
Cognitive is the first area
that we'll look at.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,100
This is the development of
thinking skills, of reasoning

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,990
and problem solving.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,170
Then we'll look at physical
development.

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,390
This is the development of gross
motor skills and fine

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,130
motor skills, so big muscle and
small muscle movement, as

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,420
well as the development
of sensory

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,920
perception, such as vision.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,130
We'll then look at social and
emotional development, and

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,480
this is the development of being
able to understand your

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,550
feelings, to cope with them, and
also how to get along with

21
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,769
other people.

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,250
And finally, language
development, which is about

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,570
communication.

24
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,880
When we look at child
development, it's important

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,580
that we look at it with
a holistic approach.

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,500
This means that we look at all
areas of development, not just

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,360
one at a time.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,330
So we're looking at the whole
person rather than just a

29
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,470
specific area of development.

30
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,950
So an example of this may be
when a child begins to walk.

31
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,160
There's very obviously a
physical development that's

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,450
happening there, so they're
defining that gross motor

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,770
skill of walking.

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,140
But at the same time, it's
important that they're aware

35
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,090
of their space around them
and where they're

36
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,230
placing their body.

37
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,170
And we could consider this as a
cognitive development skill

38
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,920
that's developing as well.

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,100
If we have a look now at the
continuation of the clip that

40
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,800
was running earlier, and we have
a look at these children

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,720
in a social situation in a
sandpit, you can see the very

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,570
many different areas of
development that are being

43
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,059
demonstrated here.

44
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,700
We have children who are
interacting with one another.

45
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,690
They're collaborating and
cooperating in order to

46
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,429
construct something.

47
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,180
They're also using both fine and
gross motor skills while

48
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,690
they're digging and moving
sand around.

49
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,800
They're communicating through
verbal but also body language,

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,600
and they are exploring their
environment as they do so.

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,500
So there's many different areas
of development that need

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,460
to be looked at all
at the same time.

53
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,950
So we know that children are
unique and they develop

54
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,030
differently.

55
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,120
However, we expect them to
develop in a sequence.

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,870
So this means that as they age,
we expect to see certain

57
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,640
stages of development happen
around about the same time, or

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,109
at least in that order.

59
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,350
So let me use a really simple
line graph to show you.

60
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,400
Let's say this is the increasing
age of a child, so

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,990
starting from birth and so on.

62
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:52,400
We'd expect early on, if we're
thinking about, say, physical

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,670
development, that a child may
start to sit and perhaps sit

64
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,989
unsupported.

65
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,600
Then as they get older, we'd
expect them to start crawling.

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,510
So first off, that's
sitting, sitting

67
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,310
unsupported, and then crawling.

68
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,750
Then as they get older still, we
might see them stand, stand

69
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,880
on their own unsupported.

70
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,960
Then they'll start to
walk and so on.

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,930
So as they get older,
they're running.

72
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,590
So you can see how although this
might happen at different

73
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,440
ages for different children,
we're expecting it to happen

74
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,226
in this sequence.

75
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:26,780
Over the next three topics,
we're going to be talking

76
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,350
about each of these areas of
development, and we'll be

77
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,760
looking at infants, toddlers,
and preschoolers.

78
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,630
Next up, Helen's going to be
talking about infants and

79
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,880
child development.

80
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,686
