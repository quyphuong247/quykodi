3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,620
One of the ways children learn
is through discovery.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,340
So what does it mean
to discover?

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,939
Well, basically it just means
you go outside, and you look

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,840
around, and you feel,
and you sense.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,040
When I say go outside, I'm
really saying you just go into

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,590
your world.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,759
It doesn't necessarily have
to be the outdoors.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,620
But the point is, we interpret,
and we experiment,

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,419
and we discover, and
we investigate.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,970
It's like if a child puts their
hand in a mud puddle,

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,650
and they find the mud is really
nice and squishy.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,699
But it's also very cold.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,190
That's a discovery that the
child has made and has learned

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,300
something from.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,269
Or it might be a child who goes
and hides in a bush and

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,010
finds that if I stay really
quiet, no one will

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,800
actually find me.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,699
So what is the actual process
of discovery?

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,880
I guess it starts in a basic
form with children just

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,060
trialling and finding that
they make a mistake--

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,000
so, a simple thing.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,500
They'll just test something
out, they won't like the

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,870
result, and they'll say, maybe
I won't do that again--

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,760
simple trial and error.

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,540
But then it becomes a little
bit more sophisticated,

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,140
because children start
to make hypotheses.

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,810
In other words, they form
an idea about something.

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,560
Such as here, these boys are
looking at some bones.

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,160
And they formed a hypothesis
that I think bones break

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
because they are
full of holes.

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,550
So in this situation what they
decided to do was to see what

34
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,360
would happen if they mixed up
some plaster and put the bones

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,390
into the plaster, and wondering
whether or not

36
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,870
perhaps that would make those
bones a lot stronger.

37
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,550
When we learn, we experiment
with what we

38
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,700
call cause and effect.

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,520
And what that means is in this
situation, the boys are mixing

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,070
up some plaster.

41
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,250
And they may find that if they
put too much water in it, it

42
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,650
actually won't sit.

43
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,820
And they'll work that out as
they go along through that

44
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,700
process of discovery.

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,410
And then finally, when they've
done that and the bones are

46
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,060
set in the plaster, they'll
actually evaluate whether they

47
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,980
were correct or not.

48
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,170
It might not work.

49
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,119
It might work.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,830
But that's what discovery
is about.

51
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,140
So how do we support
this process of

52
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,230
discovery for children?

53
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,030
I guess the first thing to
really remember is that

54
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,660
children will children any
way, often despite us.

55
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,510
But as adults, we can actually
support the process by perhaps

56
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,750
resourcing and asking
some questions.

57
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,220
If we take a look here at this
picture of these children, and

58
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,130
they're involved in what
we would call an

59
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,740
archaeological dig.

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,560
And if you look really closely,
you might be able to

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,150
see that very, very fine string
line that's being put

62
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,110
around the area that
they're working.

63
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,440
You'll see that they've got a
little brush where they've

64
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,460
actually been brushing away
what they've dug out.

65
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,960
Perhaps even the adult has
planted that little structure

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,210
in the dirt in the first
place for the

67
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,970
children to actually discover.

68
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,260
So they've resourced
that type of play.

69
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,200
The other thing that you might
like to do is to use

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,230
questioning.

71
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,840
So ask some specific
questions.

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,600
So in this particular scenario,
an adult might

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,680
actually go up to the children
and say, I wonder who was

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,900
living in this city back then.

75
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,150
