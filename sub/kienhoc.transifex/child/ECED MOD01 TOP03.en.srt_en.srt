2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,620
So what can we expect
for infants?

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,740
That is, from birth up
to a year of age.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,610
And why is it really important
that we understand their

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,810
development?

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,720
I guess it's really so we as
adults can provide for them.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,689
Because up until 12 months of
age, children are actually

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,360
learning to think.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,580
They're learning
to move around.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,670
They're learning to understand
their own feelings.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,040
They're learning to get along
with other people.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,240
And they're learning
how to communicate.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,250
They're actually developing
their first words.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,720
So let's take a look at
an infant's cognitive

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,260
development.

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,650
Up until around 3 months of
age, they're really quite

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,160
immobile, but there's a lot
happening in terms of their

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,059
developing brain.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,920
Infants at that age really like
to focus in on a human

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,970
face, and they're particularly
attracted to our eyes and to

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,200
the movement of our mouth.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,840
Then when they're moving up
into the 6 months of age

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,680
bracket, where they're actually
able to start rolling

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,200
over and reaching out, you'll
find that they start to reach

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,640
out for an object.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,720
They'll grasp it, and then
they'll usually bring it to

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,880
their mouth, where they're
actually exploring the shape

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,020
and the texture of
that object.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,229
The next thing that happens,
coming between 6 months to

30
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,595
around 12 months of age, is
a really exciting time.

31
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,570
It's when they develop what's
called object permanence.

32
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,100
And what that means is, if you
have a look at this photo here

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,030
of the baby with the little
yellow ball, what you'll see

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,590
is that if an adult was to
actually place a rug over that

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,020
yellow ball, the baby would
still know that

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,420
the ball was there.

37
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,430
Prior to object permanence, once
it's out of sight, it's

38
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,160
basically out of mind.

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,810
But when the object permanence
develops, they'll even go and

40
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,890
hunt for it, because
they know that it's

41
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,580
actually still there.

42
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,490
So what about an infant's
physical development?

43
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,560
When they are very,
very young-- up

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,480
until about 3 months--

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,649
they have what we call
time on their tummy.

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,660
And that's when it's
really critical.

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,240
Even though it looks a big
effort for them to actually

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,320
spend that time on their tummy,
it's really important

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,049
for them in terms of developing
their muscles.

50
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,120
You'll see that they actually
just start to lift their head,

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,840
and a tiny little bit
of their chest will

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,650
lift up off the floor.

53
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,940
Then as they get a little bit
older, we're reversing this,

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,690
and we're looking at the
fact that they're

55
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,410
actually able to sit.

56
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,680
But their back is not

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,820
necessarily that strong either.

58
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,090
So it's a good idea for a baby
of that age to prop them up

59
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,430
with some cushions.

60
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,630
Normally if they were sitting on
our lap, of course, they'd

61
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,260
be leaning against us.

62
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,239
But if they're sitting alone,
we need to prop them up on

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,130
some sort of cushion.

64
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,040
Because obviously, without that,
they're just going to

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,900
topple over backwards.

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,590
And then finally, as they're
getting older, when they've

67
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,510
got on to tummy time again,
they'll start to be able to

68
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,690
push themselves up
with their arms a

69
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,500
little bit more strongly.

70
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,360
And then the next step is that
they can actually bring their

71
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,000
knees up underneath them, and
then they'll start to actually

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,660
experiment with rocking
backwards and forwards.

73
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,680
It's really sort of a
pre-crawling movement.

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,870
And then, of course, finally,
when they've mastered that

75
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,160
physical skill, they'll
actually be

76
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,030
able to start to crawl.

77
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,510
And as you'll see, once they
actually start to crawl,

78
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,530
they're off.

79
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,720
And you'll have lots and lots of
dirty knees as a result of

80
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,730
that, because they're off
to explore the world.

81
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,649
So what's happening
socially and

82
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,850
emotionally for our infants?

83
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,960
Well, a really magical time that
happens usually within

84
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,990
the first three months is the
baby gives us his first or her

85
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,430
first smile.

86
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,170
And it's an absolutely amazing
moment for anyone who's

87
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,190
actually witnessed that.

88
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,019
Then what we find moving up
around to about the six month

89
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,670
mark is that infants actually
show a preference for familiar

90
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,770
voices and for familiar faces.

91
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,159
So they're more likely to smile
at people they know and

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,830
perhaps look a little
bit wary of people

93
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,539
that they don't know.

94
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,770
This then escalates.

95
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,469
When they're moving in between
about 6 to 12 months, they

96
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,200
become actually more
wary of strangers.

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,979
And that's when they develop
what we call separation

98
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,600
anxiety, and we're going to
explore that a little bit

99
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,400
further later on in
another topic.

100
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,659
But they do become wary of
people that they don't know.

101
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,890
But they also are able to
interact and are aware of

102
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,580
other children around them
and will actually

103
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
spend time with them.

104
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,280
So let's take a look
at language.

105
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,599
Obviously, right from birth,
babies will start to cry.

106
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,950
It's their way of communicating
to us that they

107
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,170
have needs and that we need to
actually meet those needs.

108
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,230
Alongside of that though, we
start to hear some other

109
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,620
vocalisations.

110
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,260
We'll hear them cooing, and
we'll hear them gurgling, and

111
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,219
we'll hear them making some
little babbling noises.

112
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,340
They don't really make any sense
to us, but they're the

113
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,340
rudimentary form of language.

114
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,060
Then as a child develops, what
they then start to do is they

115
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,790
repeat sounds that they hear,
so it's kind of like them

116
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,000
practicing the mechanics
of language.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,300
And often they'll repeat
something over and over again

118
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,900
for quite a long
period of time.

119
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,580
Then moving roundabout from the
sort of 6 to 12 months of

120
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,419
age mark, you'll find that
children start to understand

121
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,610
simple requests and simple
instructions.

122
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,500
They certainly learn to
understand the word &quot;no,&quot; but

123
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,680
they also are developing
their own first words.

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,430
Now sometimes they'll use a word
out of context, and we

125
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,830
wonder do they really
know what that is.

126
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,750
But it is not until they
actually repeat a word over

127
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,620
and over again and it fits
into the context, such as

128
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,530
&quot;dad,&quot; that we actually say
that's their very first word.

129
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,640
So as Caitlin explained
before, it's

130
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,210
the same with infants.

131
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,599
They will develop at their
own rate but in

132
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,630
a predictable sequence.

133
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,270
So where does that sequence
go from here?

134
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to hand back to
Caitlin to talk you through

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,270
the development of toddlers.

136
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,642
