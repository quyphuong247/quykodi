00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:14,290
So what do we know about a
child's brain and their

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,349
nervous system?

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,290
We know that the brain and
nervous system are made up of

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,180
cells, cells we call neurons.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,340
And what these neurons do is
they transmit and they receive

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,390
signals from all around
the body.

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,890
So for instance, if you were
to reach out and to touch

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,650
something hot, a signal would
go back to the brain.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,489
And then that signal would
then instigate another

11
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,520
reaction which would tell you
to move your hand away.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,340
That's an example of a fairly
rudimentary but very important

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,930
connection and set of signals
that's happening.

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,540
When an infant is born, their
brain is essentially

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,110
underdeveloped.

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,620
There are billions and billions
of neurons there, but

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,700
they're not connected
together.

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,040
They actually need to start
connecting together.

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
If you think about, for
instance, a number of freeways

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,220
on a road map, but there's no
minor roads or no smaller

21
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,170
highways connecting those
places together, those

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,800
freeways together.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,090
And as the child actually grows,
then those neurons

24
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,650
start to connect, both in the
normal course of development,

25
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,130
but also through
the experiences

26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,920
that the child has.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,240
And in fact, one neuron has the
capacity to connect with

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,869
up to 15,000 others.

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,600
So while we have billions and
billions of neurons, we also

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,679
end up with trillions and
trillions of connections.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,400
And this is happening
very, very rapidly.

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,510
Initially, in the first three
months, there's an amazing

33
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,770
amount of growth happening.

34
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,650
And by the time a child gets
to about 3 years of age,

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,270
that's when those connections
have pretty well formed.

36
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,430
So why do we need all of
these interconnections?

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, basically, for everything
that we do.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,080
We learn that if we smile,
we get a response.

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,930
We're able to go out into
the world and see

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,670
what's actually happening.

41
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,420
We're able to understand
how things work.

42
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,809
We're able to be able to problem
solve and determine

43
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,310
how perhaps something
fits together.

44
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,520
All of those interconnections
are sophisticated and complex,

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,550
and they control virtually
everything that we do.

46
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,920
And one of the most important
things we do as social beings

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,530
is we learn to form and then
to maintain positive

48
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,140
relationships with others.

49
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,239
There is an area in our
brain, really just in

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,980
here, behind our eyes.

51
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,239
It's called the prefrontal
cortex.

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,080
And in a baby, that area is
very specialised for that

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,650
concept of attachment, as
we talked about before.

54
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,860
But like every other part
of the brain, it's

55
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,000
underdeveloped.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,400
And it's actually only through
the interactions that they

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,400
have with their caregivers, with
other children, and with

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,520
adults, that actually
help to develop that

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,830
side of their brain.

60
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,000
So it's a very, very
specialised area.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,450
And without those relationships,
those positive

62
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,200
ones, then a child would not
actually be able to make those

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,089
very, very specific connections
that they're going

64
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,450
to need in order to get along
with others, to feel good

65
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,410
about themselves, and to really
be able to get by in a

66
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,180
very complex social world
that they live in.

67
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,430
