Let's now review what all of this five week
course has meant for understanding and dealing

2
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,050
with complex problems.
A major theme has been presenting different

3
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:38,320
kinds of ignorance. This started in week 1
with various taxonomies, that is theories

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,500
that have been developed: Ann Kerwin's unknowns
matrix, Mike Smithson's typology, Matthias

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,350
Gross' house of unknowns. In week 4, Mike
looked at the scientific evidence that is

6
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,750
starting to accumulate about these differences.
In dealing with complex problems it's important

7
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,710
to understand that there are different kinds
of unknowns -- not only because they provoke

8
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,649
different reactions, but also because they
require different responses. Couple that with

9
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:14,240
the realisation that we know less than we
think we do. Both of these make us heavily

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,380
reliant on working with others. As I discussed
last week, gaining a better appreciation of

11
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,159
unknowns in complex problems is a field that
is still wide open and we're only taking baby

12
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,869
steps in developing a solid understanding.
In terms of working with others, ignorance

13
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:39,860
also tells us some useful things about managing
collaborations. First, Ann Kerwin helped us

14
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,860
appreciate unknowns knowns or tacit knowledge.
These can lead to misunderstandings in collaborations.

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,759
Common examples of tacit knowledge are our
ingrained cultural behaviours and the ways

16
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,799
of doing things that we have absorbed while
learning our disciplines or professions. Tacit

17
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,320
knowledge also comes into play in the assumptions
that we make about each other, what we talked

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:12,320
about in Week 1 as "filling in the blanks".
Rather than being sources of irritation, these

19
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,120
misunderstandings are more profitably used
as openings for partners in a collaboration

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,780
to gain a deeper understanding of each other.
Managing collaborations also involves managing

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,060
differences in the ways we feel about and
respond to ignorance. These become particularly

22
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,400
sensitive when there are differences between
partners in what is a taboo and what people

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,400
do not want to know. We also need to be very
careful to... not to destroy trust in a collaboration

24
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:50,799
when we impose ignorance on our partners,
for example by withholding information.

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,799
A second major theme of the five weeks of
lectures was demonstrating the many different

26
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:02,799
uses of ignorance. I concentrated on scoping,
boundary-setting and integration. I started

27
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,459
in the middle with boundary setting, as a
special case of things we ignore and also

28
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,829
as a response to the costliness of knowing,
especially transaction costs and opportunity

29
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,959
costs.
Then, because specialization spreads risk

30
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,310
in dealing with ignorance, when we are tackling
complex problems, we necessarily need to bring

31
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:30,310
specialisations together, generally in the
form of different disciplines and stakeholders.

32
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,780
Scoping helps us decide who needs to be at
the table. Scoping can also help us avoid...

33
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,109
avoid various familiarity biases. We then
need to integrate all that knowledge, but

34
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,500
we equally need to integrate what we don't
know.

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,690
The important realisation for me when I first
learnt about Mike's work over a decade ago

36
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,479
was that when we want to make change happen,
it is not just important to bring what we

37
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:01,840
know to bear, but also what we don't know.
During this series of lectures we covered

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,590
tactics used to stop change from happening
when those with vested interests -- especially

39
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:13,590
money and power -- are threatened. These tactics
include manufacturing ignorance, withholding

40
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,590
information, proliferating disinformation,
inhibiting curiosity, and in extreme cases

41
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:27,000
censorship and oppression.
Finally, a theme that I introduced is the

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,270
importance of understanding that complex problems
require us to face up to, and more effectively

43
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:39,270
deal with, imperfection. There are multiple
reasons for, and dimensions of, this imperfection.

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,699
A first clue came from one of the metaphors
covered in week 1: the more we know, the more

45
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,969
we are aware of what we don't know. And of
course we can't know everything, let alone

46
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:56,810
know all the things that we don't know. Ann
Kerwin's concept of unknown unknowns alerts

47
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,389
us to the fact that there will also be unknowns
in complex problems that catch us by surprise.

48
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:08,259
And in week 5 we learnt that there are problems
with rare outcomes where it is just not possible

49
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:15,180
to have a high degree of certainty and that
also have imperfect outcomes therefore.

50
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,900
The fact that complex problems are big and
that we often don't pay good attention to

51
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,479
scoping is another source of imperfection.
We can't do everything and have to draw boundaries

52
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,300
concentrating on what's feasible. That means
that aspects of the problem are ignored and

53
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,729
that's another source of imperfection. So
is the fact that there are no ways to integrate

54
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,219
everything we know, let alone integrating
everything we don't know.

55
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:46,330
These are all components of so-called "wicked"
problems, in other words problems that don't

56
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:53,139
have straight-forward perfect solutions, so
imperfection is inbuilt in most complex problems.

57
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:58,199
I look forward to receiving your reflections
on this first five week course through the

58
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,360
discussion forum.
I also look forward to interacting with you

59
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,840
again in Ignorance II, the second five week
course. As Mike said we'll be looking at methods

60
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,680
for living and functioning amid ignorance.
In particular, how can we best deal with situations

61
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,889
where we must make choices but know very little?
This has particular relevance for understanding

62
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,719
and tackling complex problems.
