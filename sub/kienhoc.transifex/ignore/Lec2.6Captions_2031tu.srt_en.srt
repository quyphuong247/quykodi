00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:28,699
https://youtu.be/2chigO2MbSY
So far, we've examined motives for ignorance
and for ignoring as well. We've been focusing

2
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:34,020
on the uses that we have for our own ignorance.
Now we're going to turn to the ways in which

3
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,020
we impose ignorance on other people, and the
uses we, and others, have for that.

4
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,010
Probably the most obvious, direct way in which
ignorance is "socially constructed" is when

5
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,050
people impose it on other people. As is often
the case with ignorance, the idea of imposing

6
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:59,050
it on other people tends to bring up negative
images of detrimental acts with sinister motives.

7
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,100
That's perfectly understandable. The world
produces an endless supply of unethical secrecy,

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,100
lies, and other outrages by which more powerful
agents keep the less powerful "in the dark."

9
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,479
Withholding information from those who have
a right to know is a high-handed act at the very

10
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:23,030
least, and lying to them is even worse.
However, this topic becomes really interesting

11
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,979
when we observe that, despite the fact that
most of us dislike having information withheld

12
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:33,649
from us and dislike being lied to even more,
both secrecy and lying are very widespread

13
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:40,649
practices. So there's a strong asymmetry here:
We dislike it being done to us but we're quite

14
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,899
willing to do it to others. Moreover, information
withholders and liars usually believe they

15
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,200
have sound moral justifications for their
actions. I venture to say that nearly all

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,340
of us have kept at least temporary secrets
or lied for what we believed were very good reasons.

17
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,330
I certainly have. Given these observations,
it shouldn't be too surprising to find social

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,709
norms advocating withholding or concealing
information and even lying. We'll begin with

19
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,129
norms for withholding or selectively omitting
information, and then move on to norms for

20
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:17,750
outright lying.
Let's begin with a fairly uncontroversial

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,349
and benign example of a social norm for temporarily
withholding information in the service of

22
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:30,349
a desirable event: Creating pleasant surprises.
Receiving gifts, watching movies, and reading

23
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:36,370
novels are activities that can be ruined if
some miscreant gives away their hidden contents.

24
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,189
A social norm has it that we don't reveal
the contents of a gift-wrapped birthday present

25
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:46,730
to its intended recipient, or the ending of
a movie we've seen to a friend who hasn't.

26
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,510
So here we have an agreement between the knower
and the ignoramus; most of us want our birthday

27
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,670
presents to be surprises and we don't want
to know how a movie ends before we've seen

28
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:03,670
it. And we hope that others will respect our
wishes by duly keeping us in the dark.

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,530
Information-withholding norms often are purpose-built.
An example can be found in experimental research

30
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:17,530
on humans and other animals, in the method
called "blinding." Research participants are

31
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,579
"blinded" by not knowing which experimental
condition they have been placed in. For instance,

32
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:30,260
are they getting the new wonder test-drug
or a placebo? Likewise, the experimenters

33
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:37,200
are "blinded" when they don't know which experimental
condition each participant is assigned to.

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,859
That way, they can't inadvertently give the
game away to the participants. The idea of blinding

35
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:47,700
the experimenter goes back to Claude Bernard,
the great 19th century French physiologist

36
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,700
and medical scientist. A "double-blind" experiment
is one that fulfills both of these conditions.

37
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:01,400
Norms and rules for enforcing selective ignorance
pervade ordinary social life. Many occupational

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,230
roles not only require specialized knowledge
but also specified ignorance-- restrictions

39
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,180
on access to information specified by one's
role. A well-known case in point is the military

40
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,230
concept of the "need to know," whereby even
personnel with appropriate security clearances

41
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,940
must require information for the performance
of their official duties in order to be granted

42
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,000
access to it.
Moreover, people and organizations are capable

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,889
of adapting or adjusting these norms when
they fail to perform well. The Sept. 11, 2001,

44
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,410
attacks revealed difficulties due to the strongly
compartmentalized information silos produced

45
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:48,010
by the strict "need to know" culture of American
intelligence agencies. The 9/11 Commission

46
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,640
recommended a shift in the intelligence community
from the "need to know" culture to a "responsibility

47
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,770
to provide" approach, later implemented in
the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism

48
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,370
Protection Act.
Confidentiality is another social norm for

49
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,620
withholding information that is premised on
a moral injunction. Being asked and agreeing

50
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,590
to treat information confidentially brings
a moral responsibility not to reveal it to

51
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:22,290
others. At times, confidentiality can collide
with other moral principles. A researcher

52
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,880
or journalist interviewing heroin addicts
about heroin usage will want to guarantee

53
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,870
interviewees anonymity and confidentiality.
After all, the interviewees are going to be

54
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:39,320
admitting to illegal acts. But what if an
interviewee reveals that they have knowingly

55
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,840
infected someone with hepatitis C? Duty-of
care principles would compel the interviewer

56
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,280
to report the crime to the authorities.
Ethical principles regarding the withholding

57
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,740
of information also can come into conflict
with the law. Returning to our researcher

58
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,500
or journalist, what if the researcher's data
or the journalist's tapes are subpoenaed by

59
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,470
a court of law? The human research ethics
committee on which I've served at my university

60
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:12,100
forbade researchers to promise research participants
absolute confidentiality-- They could only

61
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,100
promise "confidentiality as far as the law allows."
Moral injunctions regarding selective ignorance

62
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,280
abound in childrearing. Responsible parents
have to deal with the question of what children

63
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,280
should and should not know, or at least when.
This issue is perennial and mundane, but it

64
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,900
can be an ethical and moral minefield nevertheless.
When should children find out about reproduction?

65
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,110
When should they know about illicit drugs?
For a more agonizing case, let's revisit the

66
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,240
issue of children of a parent who has a heritable
disorder such as Huntington's Disease. Even

67
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,640
if we grant that children should be given
the genetic marker test to determine whether

68
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,640
they have inherited it, when should they know
the result? Age 5? Age 10? A news story in 2010 about Ugandan

69
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,210
draft policy recommending that children born
HIV positive be informed of their illness

70
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,600
at age 10 understandably generated heated
debate.

71
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Now let us venture onto thinner ice: Social
norms that promote lying. There is a large

72
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,900
philosophical literature on lying, perhaps
the most well-known sourcebook being Sissela

73
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,890
Bok's (1978) classic work. Bok takes a rather
severe position about lying and liars, concluding

74
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,220
that lies seldom can be justified. After all,
what would it be like to live in a world where

75
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,690
lying was commonplace? We wouldn't be able
to trust anyone or anything they said. Even

76
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,150
a pragmatist who disregards ethical and moral
arguments against lying still would have to

77
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:52,950
admit that lying is risky if it isn't approved
of and they get caught. One's reputation can

78
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:59,000
suffer irreparable damage.
Nevertheless, there are contexts where lying

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,620
is not only commonplace but also approved
of. The most obvious cases of virtuous lying

80
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,180
are in competitive games, warfare, and other
strongly competitive settings. Bluffing in

81
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,220
poker, body-faking in ballgames, and spreading
disinformation among the enemy in a war all

82
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,430
are clear cases where lying is viewed as legitimate
and expected. As social psychologist W. P.

83
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,590
Robinson puts it, "The more competitive the
situation and the more serious the consequences

84
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,450
of winning or losing, the more likely it is
that deception will be normative or required."

85
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:41,279
And so liars can even be romantic heroes.
Lionized liars include sportspeople in games

86
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,570
requiring bluffing or feinting, spies, military
commanders who outwit their foes, superheroes

87
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,390
with secret identities, detectives who not
only uncover deceit but deceive criminals,

88
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,480
and even successful con artists. Witness Frank
Abagnale, who successfully passed bad cheques

89
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,939
worth more than $2.5 million in 26 countries,
and passed himself off as a commercial airlines

90
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:11,790
pilot, a medical doctor, lawyer, and teacher.
The popular film "Catch Me If You Can" is

91
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,970
based on his life.
On balance, evidence points to a widespread

92
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:21,019
belief that omitting to disclose information
is not as bad (or at least, not as risky)

93
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:27,339
as lying. For instance, Burgoon, Callister,
and Hunsaker's (1994) investigation of equivocation

94
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:34,230
or omission versus falsification in doctor-patient
interactions found that about 85% of the participants

95
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,339
admitted to omission but only 34% admitted
to falsification. Likewise, Brown and Levinson's

96
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:45,290
(1987) pioneering anthropological work on
politeness suggests that people intending

97
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:51,399
to be polite to one another will try making
do with ambiguity or vagueness, in other words,

98
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,399
tactfulness, before they resort to outright
distortion or deception.

99
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,410
Nevertheless, lying is common enough to suggest
that many of us are willing to take the risks

100
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,120
because of what we can get out of it. And
aside from the more obvious motivations such

101
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,949
as fear and greed, there are some arguments
for virtuous lying that are not as obvious

102
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:17,209
as the notion that all is fair in love, war,
and soccer.

103
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:21,300
Parents frequently have to deal with the question
of whether to lie to their children. They

104
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,939
may believe that some lies best serve their
children's interests. Should children be led

105
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:32,870
to believe in Santa Claus, and if so, when
and how should they find out he doesn't exist?

106
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,370
Even just permitting a child to believe in
Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth

107
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:42,579
Fairy requires tacit complicity with falsehoods.
But plenty of responsible, well-intentioned

108
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:49,189
parents who love their children go further
by actively sustaining these illusions. In

109
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:53,019
fact, parental lying is widespread and it
goes far beyond Santa Claus and the Tooth

110
00:10:53,019 --> 00:11:00,019
Fairy. In the third episode of the 2010 Politically
Incorrect Parenting Show and the book that

111
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,129
came out in 2013, Dr. Nigel Latta discussed
parental lying with the aim of openly discussing

112
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:11,649
its pros and cons. Interestingly, this practice
has received relatively little attention from

113
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:17,249
researchers studying childrearing practices.
In a 2009 news story about University of Toronto

114
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:22,459
studies investigating how and why parents
lie to their children, the most common reasons

115
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:29,139
parents gave were to influence children's
behavior and emotional states.

116
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:35,329
The greater the power the liar has over the
target of the lie, the less risky lying becomes.

117
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:40,730
Governments routinely lie to their constituents
and corporations routinely lie to their customers.

118
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,879
Within these organizations there is no shortage
of justifications for such lies. When threatened,

119
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:53,189
lies are increasingly found to be useful.
Phillip Knightley's classic 1975 book, "The

120
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:58,819
first Casualty", takes its title from the
old adage that the first casualty in war is

121
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:04,589
truth. Knightley shows that from the American
Civil War through World War II and beyond,

122
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:10,889
American casualties are minimized and enemy
casualties exaggerated extensively. Defeats

123
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:16,319
are reported as victories. Entire battles
or campaigns go unreported, and non-existent

124
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:22,369
ones are reported in detail. Censorship and
secrecy are justified by appeals to preserving

125
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:28,009
advantages against the enemy and maintaining
morale. It is only recently, with the advent

126
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:33,399
of internet-connected social media users,
that ordinary citizens can combine to contest

127
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,029
official accounts of war events. The belief
that corporations regularly lie to their customers

128
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,459
and to governments is sufficiently widespread
to have generated a cottage-industry of books,

129
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,699
articles, documentaries, blog posts, and of
course, law-suits.

130
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:54,019
During this lecture we have examined norms
for withholding information and lying. It

131
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:58,269
should be apparent that norms for withholding
information are much more likely than norms

132
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:05,269
for lying to be constructed around multilateral
agreements among the stakeholders. Privacy,

133
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:11,240
concealed movie endings, and surprise gift-giving
are multilateral agreements between the parties

134
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,670
withholding the information and those from
whom it's withheld. Secrecy, on the other

135
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,949
hand, is unilateral and less likely to be
agreed to by those from whom information is

136
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:25,970
being kept.
We have seen that there is such a thing as

137
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,329
virtuous lies, although the contexts for them
are quite restricted. In hyper-competitive

138
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:38,009
situations such as war, probably the most
accessible rationale for lying is the conviction

139
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:44,029
that the enemy also is going to do it. As
compelling as it is, this is not a stellar

140
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:49,740
example of an ethical principle. There's also
a potential for arrogance and hubris, and

141
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,119
even dehumanization, in the justifications
given by those holding secrets or telling

142
00:13:55,119 --> 00:14:01,759
lies, when they refer to protection of and
security for less powerful parties. Nevertheless,

143
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,829
lies and secrets are among the most common
ways ignorance gets constructed. And once

144
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:12,069
you understand this, you really get that the
universe isn't to blame for all that much

145
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:16,709
of our ignorance. We're doing it to each other
and to ourselves.
