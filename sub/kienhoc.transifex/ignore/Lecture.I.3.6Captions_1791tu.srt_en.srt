00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In an intriguing 2008 paper, sociologist Sheldon
Ungar asked why, in the age of knowledge or

3
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,790
information, ignorance not only persists but
seems to have increased and intensified. He's

4
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,070
far from the only commentator, and certainly
not the first, to have observed this trend.

5
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,540
By now, you know that along with an information
explosion, we also have had an ignorance explosion.

6
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,760
Most of us are confronted to a far greater
degree than our forebears with the sheer extent

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,670
of what we don't know and what we (individually
and collectively) shall never know.

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,579
But the ignorance explosion wasn't common
knowledge back when I started writing about

9
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:07,579
it in the 1980's. Instead, the master-concepts
were all about the "knowledge economy" and

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,640
"information society", coined by Peter Drucker
in 1969 and Fritz Machlup in 1962. Citizens

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
of the information society, participating
in the new knowledge economy, were to become

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,080
better educated and more intelligent than
their forebears and, of course, their less

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,909
fortunate counterparts in less-developed societies.
How can we make sense out of all this?

14
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:38,850
So, are we better educated and more intelligent?
There's evidence that the average IQ has been

15
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,810
increasing in a number of countries for some
time, so the kind of intelligence IQ measures

16
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,390
has improved. In many countries, literacy
rates and education levels have increased.

17
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,770
And thanks to the digitization of huge archives
of data and literature, many laypeople can

18
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,259
and do become knowledgeable about legal, financial,
medical, and other practical matters that

19
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:08,259
concern them, in ways that used to be impossible.
And finally, the advent of MOOCs looks like

20
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,560
providing education in a panoply of technical
and intellectual domains for people for whom

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,640
those doors otherwise would be closed. The
advances in the democratization of nearly

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,160
all forms of knowledge and education via digitization
and the net seem inarguable.

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,110
So, what are people like Smithson and Ungar
talking about?

24
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,520
IQ may be increasing, but we also routinely
receive news of apparent declines in various

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,520
intellective skills such as numeracy and literacy.
Likewise, there is plenty of information available

26
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,390
about legal, financial, medical, and other
practical matters, but, for instance, there

27
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,390
is ample documentation of high levels of public
ignorance regarding heart disease and strokes,

28
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,090
many of the effects of smoking or alcohol
consumption, and basic medication instructions.

29
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,890
When it comes to being informed about politics
and current events, as Putnam's 1999 study

30
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,360
grimly observed, the typical university graduate
at the time knew less about public affairs

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,280
than did the average high school graduate
in the 1940's, despite the proliferation of

32
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,790
sources of information. Indeed, according
to Mark Liberman's 2006 posting, the question

33
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,860
of how ignorant Americans are has become a
kind of national sport. Critics in other countries

34
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,860
have made similar accusations of their own
citizenry: Australia and Ireland, for instance.

35
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,330
In addition to concerns about lack of knowledge,
alarms frequently are raised regarding the

36
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:52,330
proliferation and persistence of erroneous
beliefs, often with a sub-text saying that

37
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,580
surely in the age of information we would
be rid of these. Scott Lilienfeld, consulting

38
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,519
editor at the Skeptical Inquirer, sees the
prevalence of pseudoscientific beliefs as

39
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,519
by-products of two phenomena: the (mis)information
explosion and the scientific illiteracy of

40
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,739
the general population.
Is ignorance a public problem? If so, what

41
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,959
kind is it, and are there any solutions to
it? Ungar not only declares ignorance to be

42
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,470
a social problem, but also claims it is "difficult
to sell" and "under-identified" as a social

43
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,289
problem. What does he mean by these two phrases?
There are three reasons why ignorance is difficult

44
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:36,229
to sell, in the sense of persuading people
to do something about their own ignorance.

45
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:40,630
First, many of us simply don't have the time
to learn about things that others think we

46
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,080
should know. Consider all of the books, articles,
and television shows devoted to exposing how

47
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:54,020
little most of us know about science, for
example. Numerous commentators and books leave

48
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,800
little doubt that scientific illiteracy is
regarded with alarm by many well-informed

49
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,930
people. Likewise, for more than two decades
popularizers such as John Allen Paulos have

50
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:11,930
been warning us about the dangers and costs
of innumeracy through his best-selling books.

51
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,389
But these efforts have had little apparent
impact on public scientific literacy or numeracy,

52
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,389
mainly because most people cannot see the
benefits in taking the time and effort to

53
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:29,060
learn more about science and mathematics.
A second reason why ignorance is difficult

54
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:35,560
to sell can be seen in people's reactions
to revelations of their cognitive biases or

55
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,560
illusions. A reasonably accurate list of these
on Wikipedia identifies more than 100 of them.

56
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,990
Producing books about them has become a cottage
industry during the past four decades, starting

57
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,110
with Kahneman and Tversky's work in the 1980's.
The cognitive bias problem is hard to sell

58
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,770
because one of our cognitive biases is an
inflated estimate of our own abilities and

59
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,850
a conviction that we perceive reality more
or less accurately and completely. This goes

60
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,650
for me too, by the way. Moreover, we tend
to be irritated when our deficiencies in thinking

61
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,990
and decision making are pointed out to us.
I've observed this in myself, friends, colleagues

62
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,550
and students.
The third reason why ignorance is difficult

63
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:29,550
to sell is related to why it also is "under-identified"
as a problem. Ungar points out a notion widely

64
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,919
shared by most of us that there is a common
stock of knowledge that all healthy, normally-functioning

65
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,860
members of society should know. We should
all not only speak the same language but also

66
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:48,280
know the laws of the land, the lyrics of our
national anthem, that 2 + 2 = 4, that we require

67
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,850
oxygen to breathe, where babies come from,
and so on and so forth.

68
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,600
The trouble with this notion is that the so-called
information age has made it increasingly difficult

69
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,789
for everyone to agree on what this common
stock of knowledge should include while still

70
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:10,370
being small enough for the typical human to
absorb it all before reaching adulthood. I've

71
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:16,050
been in the education business for more than
three decades, so clearly I think that, in

72
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,919
general, more knowledge is a good thing. Nevertheless,
I'm aware that we educators face a common-pool

73
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,919
social dilemma. In the 2008 book I co-edited
with Gabriele Bammer I've called it the "persuasion-versus-information-glut

74
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:37,050
dilemma." All of us with an educational or
persuasive interest will want to impose our

75
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:43,599
messages on the public. I teach statistics
to psychology students, so of course I think

76
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,770
that all university students should get an
introduction to statistics. A specialist in

77
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,630
children's literature once seriously suggested
to me that a class in children's literature

78
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:00,630
should be required for all university students!
However too many messages in an unregulated forum,

79
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:07,030
 can drive the public to tune out
altogether. The scarce resource being threatened

80
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,639
with depletion is not information or knowledge,
but attention. Attention is effectively a

81
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,599
zero-sum resource. We can't pay full attention
to two things simultaneously. But information

82
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,120
is a multiplier resource. You can give me
your information and still possess it. So,

83
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,199
more and more and more education isn't the
solution to the ignorance problem.

84
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,349
If you need further persuasion, consider all
of the stuff known by people in the past that

85
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:43,349
we no longer know. In 1840 Lord Clive wrote:
"Every schoolboy knows who imprisoned Montezuma,

86
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,910
and who strangled Atahualpa." Well? Hands
up, anyone? Or take a look at the curriculum

87
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,480
for an Elizabethan schoolboy. I'm not being
sexist here; only boys were permitted schooling

88
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,500
in both periods I've just mentioned. Or who
among us knows the basics of such trades as

89
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,209
cooper, wheelwright, milliner, or fletcher?
A colleague once told me that his father was

90
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,330
a farrier and then congratulated me for knowing
what that was.

91
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:16,040
Ungar concedes that "it is impossible to produce
a full-blown, stable or consensual inventory

92
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,720
of a stock of knowledge that well-informed
members should hold." The fluidity and impossibility

93
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
of a full blown inventory are not new; they
became evident well before the so-called "age

94
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,240
of information". What is new is the extraordinary
difficulty in achieving consensus on even

95
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,480
small parts of this inventory.
In addition to public ignorance and cognitive

96
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,310
biases, there is a third kind of ignorance
problem, arising from hyper-specialization.

97
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,500
Specialized knowledge doesn't integrate itself.
Without people to put it all together we end

98
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:58,330
up with no synthesis, no "big picture." As
one commentator put it, "One cannot but marvel

99
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,700
at the absence of any adequate bureau of exchange
among specialists in different fields... which

100
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,330
one of us can follow all the technical journals
of his own specialty, even though his path

101
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:15,330
be blazed by international bibliographic catalogues?"
That was Francis B. Sumner, published in the

102
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:22,700
journal "Science", January 13, 1905.
So why is specialization such a juggernaut?

103
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,130
The most obvious explanation is that it simply
is efficient and relieves us of trying to

104
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,850
absorb amounts of information that are beyond
our control. But there is a

105
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,269
second, often overlooked factor that I brought
up in my 2008 chapter on social theories of

106
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:45,269
ignorance. In a network of cooperative specialists,
specialization spreads risk. It spreads the

107
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,670
risk of being ignorant about the wrong thing
at the wrong time, by diversifying ignorance.

108
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,950
George helps John when John's computer malfunctions,
while John helps George get rid of the fungus

109
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:05,950
destroying the tomatoes in George's garden.
This is the flip-side of specialization. As

110
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:12,250
the American comedian Will Rogers observed,
everyone is ignorant, but on different topics.

111
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,180
In a community of specialists who are networked
and trust one another, chances are pretty

112
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,450
good that no matter what problem arises, somebody
will know how to deal with it.

113
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:28,560
It should be clear by now that there are multiple
ignorance "problems", none of which have straightforward

114
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,940
solutions. In lieu of such solutions, here
are a few pitfalls and fallacies that we can

115
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:40,730
avoid. First, we can avoid false pride about
what we know. None of us knows very much,

116
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,980
relative to the vast storehouse of knowledge.
Second, we can become more aware of what we

117
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,399
don't know, at least to some extent. We might
want to think about reforming some aspects

118
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:58,230
of our educational programs to help future
generations in this endeavor. Third, we can

119
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,339
bear in mind that we have cognitive biases
and use mental short-cuts. Where these aren't

120
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:09,910
adaptive, we can generate computational and
other tools to help us. Finally, we can realize

121
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,690
that we are not cleverer than those who came
before us. We're not even always better-informed

122
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:21,389
than they were, and some things they knew
may turn out to be useful for us. A pertinent

123
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:27,339
observation in the conclusion of Cyril Kornbluth's
short story "The Mindworm", is that what many

124
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,540
very clever people have not yet learned, some
ordinary people have not yet quite forgotten.
