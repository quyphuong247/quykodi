While most of us wrestle with unknowns, as
if it's something to overcome or banish, many

2
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,990
artists, writers and musicians invite unknowns
into their work. They don't wrestle with them,

3
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,760
instead they dance with them. Unknowns, including
chance events, are catalysts for creativity.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,480
Musical improvisation is a paradigmatic example
of this and improvisation of jazz is its prototype.

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,620
We were fortunate to have jazz musician, John
Mackey, join us in the studio to talk about

6
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,340
the nature of improvisation, how it enables
on the spot creativity and the techniques

7
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,340
he uses to help the students on the journey
toward becoming capable of improvisation.

8
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:05,129
I like - well, I don't like, I love that challenge
of trying to play something that is strong

9
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,990
and convincing but then make it exciting and
it's like creating a problem on the spot and

10
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,720
then you have to fix it. Most of the time
it works, but of course sometimes there's

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,790
elements of surprise.

12
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:26,300
Something else that strikes me as going on
there as well is that the consonant part sets

13
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,480
up for the audience, for the listener, it
sets up an expectation----

14
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,960
Yes.

15
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,110
Right, so you're listening to the scale, now
you've got familiar with the notes and you

16
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,830
expect the music to carry on using those same
notes, then you violate that expectation,

17
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,830
right. So all of a sudden-----

18
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,350
It creates tension.

19
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,220
Yes, it creates tension because the person
is going, "Wait a minute, I thought we were

20
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,040
in this key."

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,210
Yes, yes, yes.

22
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,600
Yes.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Yes, I mean, from a listener's point of view,
as well as a performer's point of view, that

24
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,780
element of uncertainty creates a lot of tension
and the sense of questioning, and I like the

25
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,210
way you said it because as I get older I'm
actually really conscious of setting - it's

26
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:12,210
not always true, but mostly I like to set
the tone, so to speak, and then go way out

27
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,300
and see if I can be convincing in another
key, you know, everybody is over here, but

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,530
I'm over here playing with the same structures
that I'd use in a consonant setting, but over

29
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,500
here in a different tonality and then see
to what degree I can resolve those.

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,500
So it's kind of over here, playing over here,
then come back, touch base and the audience

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,840
go, "Oh, thank goodness he did that," and
then you go - run away and be creative, and

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,340
then of course the gap becomes smaller and
smaller and so it becomes a more ambiguous

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,070
way of playing where people will go, "Wow,
that sounds really strong, but there's something

34
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,380
really weird going on," and I find that more
exciting because it's the subtle manipulation

35
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,360
of the tonality that creates the tension,
rather than going, here's consonant and this

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,760
is definitely dissonant. You know, that's
not very subtle so more and more I'm trying

37
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,760
to bridge the gap, so to speak, in terms of
percentages of outside notes versus inside

38
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,670
notes.

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,569
So is there a big difference between when
you're creating a piece and - a piece of music

40
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,590
by itself to when you're improvising or the
process is fairly similar?

41
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,590
Yeah, you guys have thought up some really
good questions here. The way I teach improvisation

42
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,280
- if I can start off like that - is that I
say to everybody, "You're composing. You are

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,980
composers when you improvise," and of course
as you alluded to there are different ways

44
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,170
of composing. You can sit down and say, "Right,
I'm going to write a piece and then I can

45
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:50,069
use that vehicle to put on the bandstand and
then improvise over that." And then of course

46
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,990
quite often, or of late especially in the
last five years, I'll go on a gig without

47
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,750
knowing what tunes I'm going to play. I'll
talk to the audience and then I tell them

48
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,790
what's going on and I say, "Well, we're going
to play a piece in F minor now for you and

49
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,980
it will be a Bossa nova," and the guys are
going, "Okay," and so I go, "One, two, one,

50
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,840
two, three, four," and we just play.
So my job is to create a melody and it might

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,479
boo ba an boo dah ah ah ha, which is the one
I played before, and then I'll use that as

52
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:30,479
the template melody and then all our improvisations
are based off that initial one. So that's

53
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:38,139
composition on the spot versus sitting down
and really crafting out a composition that

54
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,599
you're happy to sit on for years.

55
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:48,599
So I think maybe to finish off, it would be
good to go back to Ann Kerwin's matrix of

56
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,360
knowns and unknowns and there's a box in that
matrix that talks about tacit knowledge which

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,349
is what we don't know that we know and a lot
of the time we're actually thinking about

58
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:03,779
making tacit knowledge explicit but it seems
to me that in jazz you're doing the opposite.

59
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,999
What you're trying to do is to get people
to make their explicit knowledge tacit or

60
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:13,020
unconscious so that people can then draw on
it in that creative situation. Do you want

61
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,330
to just say a little bit about that?

62
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:23,330
Yeah, well, can I go back to my childhood
because it kind of, hopefully, answers your

63
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:30,610
question? I hope it does. I grew up with the
music in the household as a little kid, so

64
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:37,610
from an early age, I had a very good aural
understanding of what the music was, so I

65
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:44,699
consciously listened to it hours and hours
a day. So by the time I actually got to an

66
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,699
instrument when I was 10 years old, I was
already playing those sounds even though I

67
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:54,949
didn't know what they were. I heard what they
were, and then I studied them and then I understood

68
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:01,949
it at a different level, so theorised and
aural together, and then you consciously practise

69
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:10,389
all these shapes and ideas, put them into
the subconscious in order to forget them,

70
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:15,210
hopefully, because as soon as you start thinking
about something that should be intuitive there's

71
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,680
a sense of stumbling.
It would be like, you know, driving a manual

72
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,379
car down the road and you're trying to explain
to someone all the subtle coordination of

73
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,539
changing gears. You know, if you actually
had to think about it, you'd be bunny hopping

74
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,580
down the road and that's kind of what it feels
like when you're improvising. As soon as you

75
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,309
start to think, there's an element - there's
a blockage that occurs and you can hear it.

76
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:42,909
You can hear the people that have spent thousands
of hours as opposed to those that are still

77
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:45,330
working on getting to that seamless point.

78
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,050
Right.

79
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,559
So, yeah, and I'm still working really hard
on trying to get to the next level and it's

80
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:55,979
funny that the more that you know, the more
you realise you don't know so I'm finding

81
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,469
that bridge to get to the next level and trying
to bridge that gap is getting more difficult

82
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,960
because, of course, you're really pushing
extremes all the time.

83
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,529
So there would be two bits that it would be
great to have you say a little bit more about.

84
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,689
What's the next level for you and can you
say something about the more you know, the

85
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:19,770
more you realise you don't know. How does
that play out in your particular field?

86
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:26,529
Look, when I pick up the instrument, it actually
feels like an extension of my fingers. It

87
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,999
kind of - it's like a transformer, kind of
morphs into your fingers, that's how I feel

88
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:37,499
about it. So in order to get to the next level
I'm trying to work on my musical imagination

89
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:42,550
and I'm trying to play specifically what I
hear and if I can't do it, I'll just sit down

90
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,619
until I can do it. So, yeah, I'm still working
on the extremes of things and trying to - extremes

91
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:55,619
of technique, I mean, and in terms of working
on that I'm still trying to focus on the beauty

92
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,930
of it because I've built up this reputation
of just playing millions of notes over many

93
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,679
years and it makes me a bit disappointed when
people still think that I do that because

94
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:12,399
my playing has changed drastically, really,
in a good way. So I'm trying to work on using

95
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,389
my quick technique in a more beautiful fashion.
Well, I guess I'm relating it on two levels.

96
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:24,879
I'm relating it to elements of my own research
and what I'm trying to find out for myself,

97
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,029
but I'm also directly relating it to my - a
couple of my idols over many years, namely

98
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:36,479
John Coltrane and Michael Brecker, are probably
my biggest inspirations, so I'm always trying

99
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,479
to find out what they're doing and trying
to capture that in my own performance practice,

100
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,230
but that will be a life-long pursuit. That's
not something I'll ever get in a few weeks

101
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,230
so I'm resigned to that, which is fine.
But, yes, I actually say to my students a

102
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,250
lot, you know, I think I've learnt a lot,
but I know that I've got a lot still to learn

103
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:13,250
and I'm really open to doing that and I'll
never be happy with what I do, and so I'll

104
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,279
always be searching for the next thing to
get under my fingers and I guess that's what

105
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:26,279
I mean specifically about, you know, the more
I know, the more I realise that I don't know

106
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,720
stuff. And I guess there's - another level
of that is there's theoretical knowledge that

107
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,100
I need to get in, but of course it's actually
applying that new theory to your instrument

108
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,240
that is probably the biggest challenge.
For instance, notes contained within a C major

109
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,649
scale, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C can be explored
structurally in terms of four note chords

110
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,279
off each note of the scale, but I stumbled
across this - it was actually a mistake in

111
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,639
my practice - is that I was practicing in
a certain structure and then I played an extra

112
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,339
note so I was actually playing pentatonic
scales, five note scales over each note of

113
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:08,569
the scale, but I started playing those particular
scales off each note of the major scale, so

114
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:09,230
there was inbuilt dissonance in those because
each note became its own key [zenith] but

115
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:16,230
within the context of a C major sound so there
is all this inbuilt dissonance and in varying

116
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:28,720
levels of dissonance. So that's what I'm - I'm
trying to turn that into a pedagogical platform

117
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,240
as well as a practical vehicle, I guess, so-----

118
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,930
Well, this has been great.

119
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,839
Yes, well thank you for having me.

120
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:41,290
Thank you.

121
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:41,980
It's nice to-----

122
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,740
Yes, well thanks for-----

123
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,420
-----sit here and talk with you again. It's
been a while.
