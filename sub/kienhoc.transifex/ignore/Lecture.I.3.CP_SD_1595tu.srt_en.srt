So, let's look at what week three's lectures
on ignorance mean for understanding complex

2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,570
problems. In week three, we talked about:
manufacturing ignorance, the social control

3
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,910
of curiosity and strategic ignorance, restricting
science for the public good, virtuous ignorance,

4
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,460
how our preferences shape our ignorance and
ignorance as a public problem. What I'm going

5
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,010
to do is to use these to reflect on three
things: scoping problems, integration and

6
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,100
making change happen. Before getting stuck
into scoping problems, let's just go back

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,320
to what Mike talked about in terms of specialisation.
Which is that specialisation is both efficient

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,500
and spreads risk. So that if you know how
to do something, but don't know how to do

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,640
something else, it's likely that, within your
circle, if you've got a large enough network

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,390
and are well enough connected, that you'll
be able to find somebody who can contribute

11
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:23,090
the set of skills that you need. This is very
relevant to complex problems and to scoping

12
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,610
complex problems.
What we want to do in terms of when we're

13
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,380
dealing with a complex problem, is to figure
out all the different specialisations, all

14
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,250
the different disciplines and all the different
areas of stakeholder knowledge, that have

15
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,320
a light to shine on the problem. And what
scoping is about is taking a broad view of

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,299
what's relevant and also figuring out what's
central. Scoping and boundary setting actually

17
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,549
go hand in hand. So, as I said scoping is
about reviewing all the possibilities and

18
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,869
looking at what's most central to dealing
with the problem. And then boundary setting

19
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,670
is figuring out what's feasible.
An analogy might be useful here. So, imagine

20
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,700
that you enter a large room full of people
who are doing all sorts of different things,

21
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,640
and you're trying to figure out what's going
on and where you might participate. If you

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,950
go up onto the balcony and look down over
the room, you get a better view of what's

23
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,200
going on and what all the different activities
are, and you can figure out where best to

24
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,200
contribute your knowledge. Scoping is much
the same. But, in fact, what often happens

25
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,849
is that we don't take this broad perspective
first. Feasibility (boundary setting) often

26
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:43,450
precedes scoping, and scoping is also... and
choosing what to do is also often dominated

27
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,080
by familiarity. The sort of things that Mike
talked about in his lecture on how preferences

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,860
constrain what we do. He talked about three
familiarity biases: status quo bias, recognition

29
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,830
heuristic and confirmation bias. And because
it's tempting to just deal with the disciplines

30
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,500
that we know, just work with people that we
know, and just approach the problem in ways

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,980
that we're comfortable with, it can be hard
to generate fresh thinking about complex problems.

32
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,920
And it might also be that because you haven't
taken a comprehensive view, you might not

33
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,830
get at the central issues, and you might deal
with something that's quite peripheral. Involving

34
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:29,739
a diverse group might, in fact, help, um overcome
some of these problems because it breaks you

35
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:36,489
out of that familiarity problem. But in any
case, the lack of attention to good scoping

36
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,510
is another reason for the inevitability of
imperfection: the fact that we don't take

37
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,510
a broad view and don't look carefully at what
the possibilities might be. So we can add

38
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:53,110
this to the issues that came up in week one,
about the more we know the more we don't know,

39
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,209
the unknown unknowns and wicked problems,
and what came up in week two, in terms of

40
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,250
boundaries and how they constrain our ability
to understand everything there is to know

41
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,930
about a problem.
Because imperfection is inevitable, you might

42
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,610
ask yourself the question, "Well why is it
that important to bother? Why is it important

43
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,400
to bother scoping a problem well? Why is it
important trying to even deal with a problem

44
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:24,030
well? Imperfection is inevitable, so why don't
we just go with the flow?" A better way of

45
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,659
thinking about that question is actually what's
going to be ... "good enough", in terms

46
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,610
of what we do? What we do is not going to
be perfect, but there are things that we can

47
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,860
do that are much better than others, and so
what's a "good enough" approach to take? In

48
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,719
fact, being able to answer that question isn't
something that we can do particularly well

49
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:49,719
yet, because we're not very good at either
thinking about, or dealing with, imperfection.

50
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:54,950
Let's move on now to integration, and the
point that Mike made, which is that specialist

51
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,000
knowledge does not integrate itself. If you
like, integration is the third aspect of the

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,419
trio of scoping, boundary setting and integration.
So scoping is about taking a comprehensive

53
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:11,159
view and figuring out what's most important,
boundary setting is taking what's most important

54
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:16,159
and doing what's feasible, and integration
is about making sense of the information that

55
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,839
you collect in the study.
There are no foolproof ways to integrate.

56
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,860
And what happens... in fact, happens most
of the time, is that a lot of rich material

57
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,729
is often "left on the table". Let's illustrate
this by talking about changing laws on illicit

58
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:37,219
drugs. Just imagine you've done a study, and
you've got prevalence of illicit drug use.

59
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:42,669
You've got the views of police and the community,
and you've also done interviews with parents

60
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,110
of drug users, so you know what they think
about changing the laws. You've got some legal

61
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,729
opinions about what changing the laws would
mean. You've got perspectives from historians

62
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,110
about why the laws are there and how things
have been done in the past. And you've got

63
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,620
a whole range of other perspectives. Now when
you're trying to bring all that together into

64
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,029
a summary statement, or into a recommendation,
you're not going to be able to fit everything

65
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:09,500
in. You're not going to be able to take all
of that information that you collected into

66
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,620
account. And it's also likely that the if...
the way that you do an integration will be

67
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,560
different from the way that somebody else
deals with an integration. Or how one group

68
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,649
does it will be different from the way that
another group does it. You'll also see that

69
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:30,570
what we've been talking about is integrating
knowledge. And it's important to integrate

70
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,719
unknowns as well as knowledge. It's hard enough,
as I've just been illustrating, to integrate

71
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:42,719
what we know. But trying to get an overview,
a perspective on what we don't know, on all

72
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,039
of the different ways of approaching what
we don't know, and what the key of those are,

73
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:54,039
is also a really important part of integration.
Let's go back to the three pentagons that

74
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,219
I talked about in the first lecture. So, this
is about three dimensions for understanding

75
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:06,250
complex problems: synthesizing what we know,
understanding unknowns and what we don't know,

76
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,390
and if we're trying to take action on a problem,
we need to bring together what we don't know,

77
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,140
and what we don't... what we know and what
we don't know. We need to integrate these

78
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:22,140
two things. So, this brings us back to the
inevitability of imperfections. So, not...

79
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,070
all of the things that we talked about last
week, the lack of attention to scoping that

80
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,080
we've talked about earlier; but the fact that
we've got no foolproof ways of integrating,

81
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,399
and that we're not very good at integrating
unknowns, are two more reasons why imperfection

82
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:45,169
is inevitable.
Let's stay with the three pentagons, and concentrate

83
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:52,169
on the third pentagon, which is, how do we
support making change happen? When we make

84
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,779
change try to... when we're thinking about
making change happen, there is often opposition,

85
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,930
particularly from people whose interests are
threatened. And interests... the important

86
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,140
interests are money and power. People whose
interests are threatened don't always play

87
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:13,659
fair, and a lot of the dark sides of ignorance
that Mike talked about this week-- manufacturing

88
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,899
ignorance, withholding information, proliferating
disinformation, inhibiting curiosity, censorship

89
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:24,760
and oppression-- can all be brought to bear.
Good examples that Mike also talked about

90
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,519
are the tobacco industry and the tactics that
they use. And also, what's happening now,

91
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,810
in terms of opposition to mitigating the effects
of global environmental change or climate

92
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,899
change. And so, making change happen can be
quite difficult, because you've got all these

93
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:46,399
interests coming to bear. It can be tempting
to retreat into virtuous ignorance about business,

94
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,709
and the powerful more generally. To assume
that they're not worth thinking about, that

95
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:56,240
whatever they say, whatever... whenever they're
opposed, it's always going to be because vested

96
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,440
interests are being challenged. But in fact,
that's not a particularly helpful position

97
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,150
to take. It's just as unhelpful, in fact,
as the virtuous ignorance taken by anti-intellectuals

98
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:15,150
that Mike talked about in his lecture.
What we need to do is we need to, instead,

99
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,310
get better at addressing insoluble problems.
We've got good methods for dealing with soluble

100
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,050
problems. But as I talked about in the first
lecture, we're not so good at dealing with

101
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,680
imperfection and dealing with insoluble problems.
And what we need is to be able to build up

102
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,670
the array of methods that we have.
This lecture's been a bit sombre, and a lot

103
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,460
of the things that we've been talking about
don't have perfect solutions. But there is

104
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,660
quite a lot that we can do. And in the lectures
going forward, particularly in Ignorance II,

105
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,399
the second five week block, we'll be dealing
with a lot of these in more detail.
