The domain where I do research is a crossroads
connecting cognitive and social psychology,

2
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:31,949
behavioral economics, management science,
some aspects of applied mathematics and analytical

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:39,300
philosophy. So, there's bound to be some confusion
and disagreement about terminology, and "ambiguity"

4
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:44,940
is no exception.
Let me begin, therefore, with a quick guide

5
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,189
to how "ambiguity" is used in these disciplines.
Philosophy, linguistics, and some parts of

6
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:57,009
psychology take "ambiguity" to mean multiple
plausible states or meanings. For example,

7
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:02,780
Zeki's 2004 neurobiological definition of
ambiguity has it involving "many, equally

8
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,180
plausible interpretations, each one of which
is sovereign when it occupies the conscious

9
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,640
stage". This is very close to the definition
we used in Week 1, if you recall the various

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,320
meanings we came up with for the statement,
"this food is hot". Optical illusions such

11
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,250
as the Necker or Kanisza cube, or the Rubin
vase-face figure, also exemplify this kind

12
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,320
of ambiguity. It should be no surprise that
much of the research into this kind of ambiguity

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,420
has been conducted by neuroscientists and
cognitive psychologists interested in visual

14
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,979
perception.
On the other hand, in other parts of psychology

15
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:45,170
and behavioral economics, researchers studying
decision making under uncertainty have chosen

16
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:52,080
to treat "ambiguity" as a more general term
meaning any kind of imprecision, something

17
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,060
like a combination of "ambiguity" and "vagueness"
in my taxonomy from Week 1. Thus, they would

18
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,830
consider an interval estimate, such as "the
probability of rain tomorrow is between 0.3

19
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,299
and 0.6", as ambiguous.
To get these distinctions straight, let's

20
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:15,689
go back to where we're invited to bet on three
tennis matches mentioned in the first lecture.

21
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,480
In Match 1, we know everything about both
players and, moreover, we know their win-lose

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,560
records against one another and against other
opponents are identical. They are very evenly

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,269
matched, and on the day they both are in top
form. We would be quite reasonable to regard

24
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:38,029
the probability of either player winning as
very close to 1/2, an even-money bet. This

25
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:44,959
is quite a precise probability estimate.
In Match 2, on the other hand, we know nothing

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,200
at all about either player. Furthermore, nothing
about their appearance on the day tells us

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,579
anything about which one is likely to be the
better player. We could reasonably regard

28
00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:01,209
the probability of either player winning as
being anywhere from 0 to 1. This is a maximally

29
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:07,379
vague probability estimate.
In Match 3, we also know nothing about the

30
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,389
players, but a good friend who knows a lot
about the players starts to tell us about

31
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:17,299
them. He says "This match is a foregone conclusion.
One of the players is so much better than

32
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:23,219
the other that it seems pointless for the
match to take place at all." But then he is

33
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:29,199
distracted by another friend and forgets to
tell us which player is the better one! So,

34
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:35,969
we regard the probability of each player winning
as either 0 or 1. Our estimate is maximally

35
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:41,209
ambiguous.
Now, the view that dominated accounts of rationality

36
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,540
in economics, psychology and related fields
until fairly recently holds that when it comes

37
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,540
to placing a bet on an uncertain outcome,
ambiguity and vagueness do not matter. The

38
00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:00,849
rational agent chooses the option that yields
the greatest expected return. A rational friend

39
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,639
comes over to us and we explain our understandings
of Matches 1, 2, and 3, and ask her how we

40
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,659
should bet in Matches 2 and 3.
She says, "But don't you see? It's very simple.

41
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:18,169
You should regard all three matches as even-money
bets. In Match 1, your estimate of each player

42
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:23,290
winning is 1/2. In Match 2, you regard any
probability from 0 to 1 as equally likely

43
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,490
to be true, so averaging the values from 0
to 1 gives you 1/2 again. And in Match 3,

44
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,420
you regard the probability as either 0 or
1, and their average again is 1/2." She then

45
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,790
takes out her laptop and demonstrates to us
that if we repeat bets where we win $1 or

46
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:46,790
$0 many times in each of the three matches,
our average winnings in the long run are $1/2.

47
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,610
Regardless of our friend's arguments, if we're
like most people then we don't regard these

48
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,180
three matches as identical when it comes to
betting. Daniel Ellsberg set up some ingenious

49
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:03,040
experiments demonstrating that people are
influenced by ambiguity, not just by the expected

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,290
return. Although a few pioneers such as Frank
Knight and John Maynard Keynes had explored

51
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,070
some implications for decision makers when
probabilities aren't precisely known back

52
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,790
in the early 20th century, Ellsberg brought
this matter to the attention of behavioral

53
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:24,790
economists and cognitive psychologists. His
goal was to determine whether the distinction

54
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,870
between ambiguous and precise probabilities
has any "behavioral significance."

55
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,870
Here's an example of what he meant by that
phrase. Suppose you have to choose between

56
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:45,070
drawing one ball from one of two urns, A or
B. Each urn contains 90 balls, with the offer

57
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,480
of a prize of $10 if the first ball drawn
is either Red or Yellow. In Urn A, 30 of the

58
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,830
balls are Red and the remaining 60 are either
Black or Yellow but the number of Yellow and 

59
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,080
Black balls has been randomly selected by
a computer program, and we don't know what

60
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:06,080
it is. Urn B contains 30 Red, 30 Yellow, and
30 Black balls. If you prefer Urn B, you're

61
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,000
manifesting an aversion to not knowing precisely
how many Yellow balls there are in Urn A,

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
that is, ambiguity aversion. In experiments
of this kind, most people choose Urn B.

63
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,720
But now consider a choice between drawing
a ball from one of two bags, each containing

64
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,120
a thousand balls with a number on each ball,
and a prize of $1000 if your ball has the

65
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,580
number 500 on it. In Bag A, the balls were
numbered consecutively from 1 to 1000, so

66
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,370
we know there is exactly one ball with the
number 500 on it. Bag B, however, contains

67
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,440
a thousand balls with numbers randomly chosen
from 1 to 1000. If you prefer Bag B, then

68
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,830
you may have reasoned that there is a chance
of more than one ball in there with the number

69
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:57,830
500. If so, then you are demonstrating ambiguity
seeking. Indeed, most people choose Bag B.

70
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,240
So, depending on the setup, we can be ambiguity-seeking
or ambiguity-averse.

71
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,860
Now, our rational friend would not have a
preference in either of the scenarios just

72
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,230
described. She would find the expected return
in Urns A and B to be identical, and likewise

73
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:20,850
with Bags A and B. She wouldn't care whether
she chose A or B in either setting. So, our

74
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,380
responses to these scenarios indicate that
we are reacting to the ambiguity of probabilities

75
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,380
as if ambiguity is a consequential kind of
unknown that is distinct from probability.

76
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,530
Ellsberg's most persuasive experiment (the
one many writers describe as "Ellsberg's Paradox")

77
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,780
is as follows. Suppose we have an urn with
90 balls, of which 30 are Red and 60 are either

78
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,610
Black or Yellow (but the proportions of each
are unknown). If asked to choose between gambles

79
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,420
A and B (i.e., betting on Red versus betting
on Black), most people prefer A.

80
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:01,420
However, when asked to choose between gambles
C and D, most people prefer D. People preferring

81
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,730
A to B and D to C are violating a principle
of rationality (often known as the "Sure-Thing

82
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,810
Principle") because the (C,D) pair simply
adds $100 for drawing a Yellow ball to the

83
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,560
(A,B) pair. If rational agents prefer A to
B, they should also prefer C to D. Ellsberg

84
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,100
demonstrated that ambiguity influences decisions
in a way that is incompatible with standard

85
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,330
versions of rationality. This experiment,
and variations on it, have replicated Ellsberg's

86
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,019
results many times.
But is it really irrational to be influenced

87
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,079
by ambiguity? It isn't hard to find persuasive
arguments for why a reasonable (if not rigorously

88
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:45,440
rational) person would regard ambiguity as
important. Greater ambiguity could imply greater

89
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,480
variability in outcomes. If Ellsberg's urn
contains 60 balls that are some mix of black

90
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,180
and yellow balls, then the number of yellow
balls could be anywhere from 0 to 60. In some

91
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,350
versions of the Ellsberg experiment, participants
are told that the number of yellow balls will

92
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,790
be randomly chosen. If we imagine repeatedly
running the experiment this way, the probability

93
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:12,769
of drawing a yellow ball will vary instead
of being a constant number.

94
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:17,470
Variability can have a downside. I tell students
in my introductory statistics course to think

95
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,189
about someone who can't swim considering whether
to wade across a river. All they know is that

96
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:29,100
the average depth of the river is 2 feet.
If the river's depth doesn't vary much then

97
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,879
all is well, but great variability could be
fatal. Likewise, financial advisors routinely

98
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,600
ask clients to consider how comfortable they
are with "volatile" versus "conservative"

99
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,519
investments. As many an investor has found
out the hard way, high average returns in

100
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,610
the long run are no guarantee against ruin
in the short term.

101
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,100
So, a prudent decision maker could regard
ambiguity as a tell-tale marker of high variability

102
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,019
and decide accordingly. It comes down to whether
we restrict our criteria for evaluating alternatives

103
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:10,490
to expected return (i.e., the mean) or admit
a second criterion (variability) into the

104
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,490
mix. Several models of risk behavior in humans
and other animals do incorporate variability.

105
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:22,689
Some species of animal forage for food using
what's called the "energy budget rule". The

106
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:27,490
rule is that the animal will prefer foraging
options with smaller variance when the expected

107
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,389
energy intake exceeds its requirements. However,
it will prefer greater variance when the expected

108
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:39,050
energy intake is below survival level because
greater variability conveys a greater chance

109
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:45,660
of obtaining the intake needed for survival.
Thus far, we've examined some indications

110
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,220
that ambiguity influences our decision making,
even when the expected outcome doesn't differ.

111
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,149
What happens when the information we receive
is not merely ambiguous, but conflicting?

112
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,329
We'll have a look at this in the next lecture.
