When I first started exploring ignorance and
related topics, it occurred to me that not-knowing

2
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:32,919
has a passive and an active voice. To be ignorant
of something is the passive voice. Ignorance

3
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,760
is a state. Ignoring something is an action.
That's why I made the first distinction in

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,760
my taxonomy that. However, we won't be elaborating
the taxonomy here. Instead, I'm going to going

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,510
to focus on ignoring as an intentional, even
a strategic, act.

6
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,640
To begin, ignoring often attracts a different,
and sometimes greater, moral charge than ignorance.

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,890
Most ignorance has a kind of inadvertency
about it. Ignoramuses often don't ignore important

8
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,890
information; they're just unaware of its existence.
On the other hand, lots of communications

9
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,890
to people who are ignoring things are chastisements.
Ignoring is akin to a sin of commission, whereas

10
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:22,700
being ignorant is more like a sin of omission.
Ignoring has an implicit ascription of will

11
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,709
or choice to it that being ignorant usually
does not. We tend to think that someone who

12
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:33,929
is ignoring something is doing it deliberately.
A common example is people who put themselves

13
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:40,110
and others at risk after ignoring warnings.
For instance, reader response to a Courier

14
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,110
Mail story on April 11, 2011 reporting "Three
men have been rescued after they drove around

15
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,810
Road Closed signs and into floodwaters in
central Queensland" was uncharitable, to say

16
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,489
the least. Comments and letters to the editor
expressed desires for these men to be named,

17
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:04,789
shamed, fined and otherwise punished for wasting
taxpayers' money and needlessly imperiling

18
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:09,349
the rescuers.
Despite the clear distinction between ignorance

19
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:16,349
and ignoring, people can and do confuse the
two. The Sydney Herald Sun's March 2014 headline,

20
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,280
"One-in-four girls ignoring cervical cancer
vaccine", simply has got it wrong. The actual

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,390
message in the article is not that schoolgirls
in question are ignoring the vaccine, but

22
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:34,189
that they're ignorant of it and also of the
cancer itself. Likewise, the Columbus Dispatch

23
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:40,530
May 2014 headline, "Ignoring vaccines promotes
disease", probably also has got it wrong.

24
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,790
The message in that article is not that some
people are ignoring vaccines, but that they

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,749
have incorrect ideas about them and the risks
involved.

26
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:55,420
Because it is an act and therefore can be
intentional, ignoring has uses as a social

27
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,139
or psychological tactic that ignorance seldom
can have. There is a plethora of self-help

28
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,560
remedies out there which, when you scratch
the surface, boil down to tactical or even

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,950
strategic ignoring. I'll mention just two
examples of such injunctions: "Don't sweat

30
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:18,079
the small stuff" and "live in the present".
The first admonishes us to discount the "small

31
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,959
stuff" to some extent, presumably so we can
pay attention to the "big stuff" (whatever

32
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,959
that may be). The second urges us to stop
living in the past and future and focus attention

33
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,639
on the here-and-how instead. Now I'm not saying
whether "don't sweat the small stuff" and

34
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,510
"live in the present" are good or bad advice.
the point I'm making is that ignoring has

35
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,909
its uses.
I want to move on now to cases where ignoring

36
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:50,709
is desirable. Prescriptions for rational decision-making
contain injunctions to ignore certain things.

37
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,230
Avoiding the "sunk cost bias" is one example.
The sunk cost bias occurs when we have a greater

38
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:03,230
motivation to continue an endeavour or project
once we've invested something in it: Money,

39
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:10,290
time, or other irrecoverable resources. Why
would this be dysfunctional? Imagine the following

40
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,290
scenario: You're developing a product and
have spent 90% of the money allocated for

41
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,700
it, when you discover that a rival firm has
just launched a competitive product that is

42
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,850
much better than yours will ever be. What
should you do with the remaining 10% of the

43
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:32,700
money: Use it to finish developing the product,
or use it to fund a new project? A lot us

44
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,810
would feel that if we abandon the project,
all that money, time and effort will have

45
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,580
been wasted. But that actually has nothing
to do with making the best decision about

46
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,740
what to do with the money, time, and other
resources that we have right now.

47
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,340
Now most of us probably can get our heads
around ignoring sunk costs like money or time.

48
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,930
But what happens when the costs involve more
than just money or time?

49
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,590
Columnist Jesse Singal wrote about the debates
over whether the American government should

50
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:09,379
get militarily involved to help the Iraqi
government fight back against the ISIS. She

51
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:14,720
pointed out that some of the arguments in
favour of involvement refer to sunk costs,

52
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,629
that is, the cost of the war so far. She quotes
from other columnists who directly refer to

53
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:26,050
this, for example one claiming that the monetary
cost is in the trillions of dollars, and another

54
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:32,099
saying that to not intervene would be a betrayal
of the thousands of American lives lost since

55
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,330
2001.
Singal observes that it is understandable

56
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,270
that some people would feel that if we don't
come to the aid of the Iraqi government then

57
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:46,400
those lives will have been wasted. But she
also points out that this is a dysfunctional

58
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,400
response. Sunk costs are sunk. No matter what
we do, we cannot get those lives back. She

59
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:58,330
does realize that referring to those lost
lives as a "sunk cost" feels disrespectful.

60
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,729
In fact, she goes on to say it sounds cold-blooded.
Nevertheless, the point she's making is very

61
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,020
important. When we're in the grip of a powerful
emotion or intuition, that's exactly where

62
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,449
our decisional biases are most likely to do
us damage.

63
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:19,379
Once we shift attention from ignoring things
to ignoring people, the landscape becomes

64
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:25,080
even more interesting. Most of us ignore at
least some of the people some of the time.

65
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,470
We have uses for doing so. There are even
online instructions and guides telling us

66
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,069
how to do it.
You can find debates about the morality and

67
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:37,689
effectiveness of ignoring people. For instance,
how should parents deal with disrespectful

68
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:44,689
behavior from their children? Well, one parenting
site says to ignore such behaviors. Another

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,020
admonishes you not to ignore all of them.
If the disrespectful behavior is demeaning

70
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,979
or rude, then it should be dealt with on the
spot.

71
00:06:54,979 --> 00:07:00,960
Ignoring someone over a long period of time
amounts to ostracism, or shunning. Ostracism

72
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,699
is very powerful and can be used as a method
of social control. Probably the most famous

73
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:12,770
example is the Old Order Amish, who have institutionalized
shunning as a means of punishing sinners.

74
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,919
The idea is that you refuse to eat with them,
even if they're a member of your own family; you

75
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,719
refuse to speak to them, and you ignore them
if they speak to you.

76
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:28,659
Does this work? Well, as it turns out, shunning,
or ostracism, has a powerful impact because

77
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:33,889
it feels like rejection. Social psychologist
Kipling Williams has studied the effects of

78
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:39,770
ostracism for a number of years now, and without
any apparent trace of irony remarks that it

79
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:46,270
was ignored by social scientists for 100 years.
Among his ingenious experiments is one demonstrating

80
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,409
that people feel the pain of rejection when
they're ignored by a cartoon character on

81
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:58,689
a computer screen. Williams goes as far as
to characterize ostracism as an "invisible

82
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:04,169
form of bullying", And actually, a recent
survey suggests that for some people, ostracism

83
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:10,669
is more painful than being bullied.
So far, we have focused on varieties of ignoring

84
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:16,610
that are voluntary, even strategic. But my
taxonomy suggests that ignoring isn't always

85
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:23,610
entirely voluntary. Out of the three categories
of ignoring, taboos are a good example. If

86
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:29,620
we've been raised from babyhood to regard
dogs as not something to eat, then our refusal

87
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:36,159
to taste barbequed dog won't be entirely of
our own free will. We'll probably feel revulsion

88
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,300
at the very idea. Are there other instances
of ignoring that are involuntary?

89
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,830
One good candidate is denial. Suppose you
have a good friend. For years, your friend

90
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,900
continues to believe that his ex-wife will
return to him, even though she has divorced

91
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,180
him, remarried, and has a new family with
her second husband. This is a case of ignoring

92
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,370
some obvious and important things, but is
it wilful or deliberate? You might eventually

93
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,570
conclude that your friend is "in denial".
He can't help ignoring these facts.

94
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:13,510
Denial is interesting for students of ignorance
because it sits midway between ignoring and

95
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,240
ignorance. From an outsider's viewpoint, the
denier is ignoring something, but they also

96
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,190
are seen as ignorant.
The main purpose of this lecture has been

97
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:29,420
to acquaint you with ignoring as an action,
and its uses and consequences. We've learned

98
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,720
that
Ignoring often attracts a moral charge

99
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,290
Ignoring something may be viewed as morally
worse than being ignorant of the same thing

100
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:44,290
However, ignoring has uses and sometimes ignoring
things (e.g., sunk costs) can help us make

101
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,540
better decisions
Ignoring people (especially ostracizing them)

102
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,570
is painful for them and therefore can be used
as a means of control or punishment.

103
00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:00,570
Nevertheless, not all types of ignoring are
voluntary (e.g., taboos and denial)

104
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,370
Probably the most important thing about ignoring
is that intentional ignoring is an example

105
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,110
of how we actively construct our own ignorance.
It's a good counter-example against the intuition

106
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,850
that ignorance is something that is just imposed
on all of us by other people or a recalcitrant

107
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:23,850
universe. The fact of the matter is that,
sometimes, we choose ignorance. And that's

108
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,900
what intentional ignoring is all about.
