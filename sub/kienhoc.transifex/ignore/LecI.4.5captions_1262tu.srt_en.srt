Scientists have been able to show fairly conclusively
that people behave as though they distinguish

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,320
among different kinds of unknowns, but that
doesn't necessarily imply anything about what

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,940
the brain is doing. Why should we want to
know about the brain? If the same structure

4
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,739
in the brain processes all varieties of unknowns,
then the behavioral distinctions among different

5
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:45,500
kinds would have to be accounted for by how
this one structure operates. On the other

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,260
hand, if different kinds of unknowns activate
different structures in the brain, then the

7
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,260
nature of each structure may explain our behavior
when confronted with one unknown versus another.

8
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,570
For evidence about the brain, we need to turn
to brain imaging studies and the recently

9
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:10,560
emerging discipline of neuroeconomics, which
attempts to link evidence about the brain

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,539
with behavioral evidence. Neuroeconomists
began by asking whether there is a "reward

11
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:24,149
center" that evaluates the expected outcomes
of a decision. Over the past two decades,

12
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:29,649
a loose consensus has gradually emerged among
researchers that there is such a center, involving

13
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:36,649
interactions between structures in the older
limbic and newer cortical systems of the brain.

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,229
The most well-established candidates for a
reward center are the striatum and midbrain

15
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,149
structures. Actually, "reward center" is a
bit of a misnomer. Like many of the basic

16
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:55,140
functions of the brain, the evaluation of
rewards is distributed across several interconnected

17
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,989
regions in the brain. A 2013 meta-analysis
of 206 publications identified the anterior

18
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:08,009
insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal
and posterior striatum, and thalamus as the

19
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,160
main areas in which reward evaluation seems
to take place.

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,120
Some neuroeconomists initially thought that
perhaps this reward center also may evaluate

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,620
unknowns. But this idea contradicts the classical
economists' view that rational agents (and

22
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,730
perhaps humans) assess rewards and uncertainty
independently. For instance, regardless of

23
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,140
whether a fair coin is being tossed for stakes
of $1 or $1000, its probability of landing

24
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,739
Heads still is 1/2. So, what evidence is there
that this hypothesis that the brain links

25
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:47,750
reward size with uncertainty is plausible?
Two kinds of evidence point to the plausibility

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,810
of this hypothesis. First, Schutz and his
colleagues' 2008 paper presented evidence

27
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,840
that the variance of the reward outcomes is
evaluated by some of the structures in the

28
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,870
reward center. Variance is an indicator of
uncertainty, and variability is a specific

29
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,430
kind of unknown that has been linked with
both probability and ambiguity.

30
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,499
Second, there is a long record of experimental
evidence that humans and other animals respond

31
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:22,069
similarly to both immediacy and probability.
Immediate events are treated as if they are

32
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:27,489
very high probability events. Delayed events
are treated as if they are less likely to

33
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:33,859
happen. Delayed outcomes are discounted by
humans similarly to lower-probability outcomes.

34
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:40,239
So, the reward center structures that evaluate
delayed rewards could be the same structures

35
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,569
that assess probabilities.
However, brain imaging studies showed that

36
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,969
probability and delay appear to entrain different
parts of the brain. For instance, probabilistic

37
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:57,769
uncertainty activates areas in the frontomedian
cortex, an area that seems functionally unrelated

38
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,900
to the reward center.
I now want to turn to the studies that have

39
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,189
examined whether there is such a thing as
an "uncertainty center", an interconnected

40
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,980
collection of structures in the brain that
evaluate unknowns.

41
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:19,620
In a landmark 2005 paper, Ming Hsu and his
colleagues showed that the level of ambiguity

42
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,700
in choices correlated positively with activation
in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex,

43
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,730
but negatively with the striatum. Recall that
the striatum is activated when the brain evaluates

44
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:37,650
expected rewards. Their study also included
neurological patients with orbitofrontal lesions,

45
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,289
which knock out the functions that the orbitofrontal
cortex can perform. Sure enough, the patients

46
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:49,270
were insensitive to the levels of ambiguity
and risk in the decisional tasks presented

47
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:56,050
to them. These findings led Hsu and his colleagues
to posit a neural circuit responding to degrees

48
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:03,050
of uncertainty, that is, an uncertainty center.
The prospect of an uncertainty center notwithstanding,

49
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:10,130
the 2005 study by Hsu and colleagues also
suggested that the brain processes ambiguity

50
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:17,130
differently from probability. In 2006, Huettel
and colleagues also reported neural responses

51
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,090
to ambiguity in areas partially distinct from
those activated by probabilistic uncertainty

52
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:29,090
in gambles. The Hsu and Huettel papers separately
concluded that decision making under ambiguity

53
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,860
is not a special case of risky decision making,
but instead a form of uncertainty that entrains

54
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,530
distinct mechanisms in the brain. Perhaps
there is not a unified uncertainty center

55
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,930
after all.
Several years later, a 2011 study found additional

56
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,120
neurological evidence that behavioral and
neural responses to ambiguity may not be driven

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,050
by assessments of indeterminate probabilities,
thus reinforcing the hypothesis that the brain

58
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,250
treats probabilities and ambiguity as though
they are distinct kinds of unknowns.

59
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,250
What about other kinds of unknowns such as
sample space ignorance and conflict? So far,

60
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:16,470
there is only one study addressing each of
these. Helen Pushkarskaya was the leader of

61
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,699
this investigation, and I was brought in to
help design the experiment and analyse the

62
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,530
data.
Our 2010 paper reported that sample space

63
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,210
ignorance most strongly activated regions
distinct from those activated by ambiguity.

64
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,060
We partly replicated the Huettel and Hsu findings
regarding activation regions for ambiguity.

65
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,970
Conflict, on the other hand, roused activation
in the striatum, indicating that processing

66
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,110
this kind of unknown may be affiliated with
the reward center after all. These findings

67
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,440
suggest the existence of neural networks for
processing sample space ignorance and conflict

68
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,440
that are distinct from those involved in processing
ambiguity and those entrained by probability.

69
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,860
So, where do matters stand now? We are accumulating
evidence that the brain does operate as though

70
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,840
there are different kinds of unknowns, but
we still are far from having a complete picture.

71
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,099
We do have pretty solid evidence that the
reward center isn't the place where all unknowns

72
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:25,069
are evaluated, and that tells us that the
brain must have some way of putting together

73
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:31,490
the assessments of unknowns and expected rewards
that enables humans to make decisions when

74
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,120
they don't have certainty. We also have fairly
solid evidence that the brain operates as

75
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,120
though probability and ambiguity are distinct.
We have a sketchy incomplete understanding

76
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:49,599
of what neural networks might be involved
in processing probability and ambiguity, and

77
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,349
we are only just beginning to explore how
the brain deals with other types of unknowns.

78
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:02,280
While they yield important insights, brain
imaging studies have substantial limitations

79
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,280
on what they can tell us about how people
perceive, think, and act in the face of unknowns.

80
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,949
One major limitation is that although brain
imaging studies tell us something about what

81
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:20,919
structures, or hardware, are utilized for
thinking about unknowns, they tell us nothing

82
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:27,879
about the cognitive processes themselves,
that is the software being run by the hardware.

83
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,219
We know something about where things happen
in the brain, but almost nothing about what

84
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:39,039
actually happens there.
A second major limitation is that the brain

85
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,690
is massively interconnected, and each substructure
has multiple uses. For example, the striatum

86
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,040
is part of the reward center but it also can
be activated by stimuli that have nothing

87
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,100
to do with rewards. So, we're best advised
to regard the findings of brain imaging studies

88
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,940
as tentative and provisional.
Nevertheless, this is a line of research where

89
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:08,100
we can expect many advances in our understanding
of how people think about and deal with ignorance,

90
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,170
especially as researchers continue connecting
studies of the human brain with studies of

91
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:21,170
behavior. Meanwhile, as the physicist Isidore
Rabi once said, the most exciting areas in

92
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,210
science are the ones where we still don't
know what we're talking about.
