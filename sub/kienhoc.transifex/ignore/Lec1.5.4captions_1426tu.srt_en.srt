On August 18th, 1913, the ball of a roulette
wheel at Le Grand Casino of Monte Carlo landed

2
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,289
on black 26 consecutive times. During this
streak a betting frenzy ensued as a growing

3
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,790
crowd staked increasingly large amounts on
red. They believed that the ball was due to

4
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:41,790
land on red. They lost and the casino reaped
a large reward, thanks to Gambler's Fallacy.

5
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:47,710
Gambler's Fallacy is well-known and yet it
remains a powerful intuition for most of us.

6
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:53,300
Why? Where does its seductive power come from?
To begin with, what exactly is the Gambler's

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,020
Fallacy? Here's Wikipedia's definition: "The
Gambler's fallacy is the belief that if deviations

8
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,160
from expected behaviour are observed in repeated
independent trials of some random process

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,840
then these deviations are likely to be evened
out by opposite deviations in the future."

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,649
The crucial premise is a sequence of independent
events, in other words, events whose outcomes do not

11
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:23,610
depend on previous events. Actually, they
don't have to be random. All that is required

12
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,210
is that the next event not be predictable
by the previous ones.

13
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,869
So, at the most general level, the key components
of Gambler's Fallacy are as follows. First,

14
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,460
we're observing a sequence of events that
are independent of one another. Second, our

15
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,560
minds tell us that they aren't independent.
Third, we think that deviations in one direction

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,560
from the sequence average will be corrected
by equal and opposite deviations. And fourth,

17
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,409
we therefore make predictions about the sequence
based on its earlier events. Why would our

18
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,570
minds commit this error?
A widely-cited explanation given in 1974 by

19
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,840
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman attempted
to answer this question. They claimed that

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,140
people use a "representativeness" heuristic,
whereby people judge the probability of an

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,390
event by its resemblance to the data available
to them. Thus, people expect that a short

22
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,790
run of random events should have the same
properties that it has in the long run. If

23
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,190
we believe a coin is fair and therefore the
probability of it landing Heads is 1/2, we

24
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,949
think that a run of 9 consecutive tosses landing
Tails is not representative of the coin's

25
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:43,540
long-run properties and so we expect the 10th
toss to land Heads, just like what happened

26
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,870
to the misguided gamblers in Le Grand Casino.
You can see the representativeness heuristic

27
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,919
in action if you look at the two sequences
of coin tosses in this slide. The upper sequence

28
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:01,820
looks more representative of a random sequence
than the bottom sequence does. However, they

29
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,310
both contain the same number of Heads and
Tails, and so they are equally likely to be

30
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,449
the result of a random sequence of coin-tosses.
The problem with the representativeness heuristic

31
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:20,109
explanation for Gambler's Fallacy is that
it begs the "why" question. It may well be

32
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:25,350
that we expect a short run of random events
to share its long-run properties, but where

33
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,690
does this expectation come from?
Alex Bellos, the author of a fascinating book

34
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,449
Adventures in Numberland, makes a stab at
the "why" question. He thinks it's a motivational

35
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:42,299
matter of trying to establish control over
events by reading patterns into them. That's

36
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,620
plausible, but the intuition behind Gambler's
Fallacy seems sufficiently powerful to not

37
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,350
require a motivational explanation.
More problems with the representativeness

38
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:58,109
heuristic explanation arise when we look at
a related fallacy, namely the belief in the

39
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:04,139
"hot hand". Here's the Wikipedia definition:
"... the hot hand fallacy is the idea that

40
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,290
a streak of positive successes are likely
to continue."

41
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,419
But the Hot
Hand Fallacy and Gambler's Fallacy make opposite

42
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:17,130
predictions. The Hot Hand Fallacy is a belief
in a positive correlation between earlier

43
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,750
and later events in a sequence, whereas the
Gambler's Fallacy is a belief in a negative

44
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:29,280
correlation between earlier and later events.
The representativeness heuristic has been

45
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,000
used to explain both of these, but that begs
the question of when or why people would find

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,500
positively correlated sequences more representative
in some situations and negatively correlated

47
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,500
sequences more so in other situations.
James Sundali and Rachel Croson studied real

48
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,230
betting and belief patterns in games of roulette.
Their 2006 paper pointed out that there are

49
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,410
two kinds of beliefs that players bring to
bear: Beliefs about players and beliefs about

50
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,730
outcomes. They found that players' betting
patterns fell into two categories. Those who

51
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,510
acted consistently with Gambler's Fallacy
about outcomes (betting on numbers that hadn't

52
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:16,470
appeared previously) were more likely to also
act as if they believed in the Hot Hand Fallacy

53
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:23,090
regarding players (increasing the number of
bets after a win). But players who acted consistently

54
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,030
with a Hot Hand Fallacy about outcomes (betting
on numbers that had already appeared) were

55
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,090
more likely to act consistently with a kind
of Gambler's Fallacy belief about players'

56
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,430
luck (decreasing the number of bets after
a win because one's stock of luck was due

57
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,170
to run out).
Sundali and Croson speculated that locus of

58
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:50,530
control could account for this pattern of
individual variability. Players with an external

59
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,250
locus of control believe in luck and are more
likely to believe in lucky streaks (hot outcomes)

60
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,780
and a stock of luck that can run out. Players
with an internal locus of control believe

61
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,310
they can learn the underlying principles by
which, for instance, a roulette wheel operates

62
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:14,310
(whence Gambler's Fallacy) and also are more
likely to have hot hand beliefs about players.

63
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Ayton and Fischer came up with yet another
explanation in 2004, simply based on learning

64
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:29,139
from experience. They showed that Gambler's
Fallacy or Hot Hand Fallacy could be induced

65
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:35,330
by exposing people to a sequence of events
that fit one or the other belief about the

66
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,200
sequence.
Wilke and Barrett's 2009 paper took this experiential

67
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,820
explanation for Hot Hand Fallacy one step
further. They point out that humans didn't

68
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:51,180
evolve in casinos but instead in environments
where resources tend to be clumped as is the

69
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:58,010
case for food resources in foraging environments,
and they claim that the hot hand intuition evolved

70
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,930
from successful foragers being more likely
to pass their genetic material on to succeeding

71
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,220
generations.
In my 1997 paper, "Judgment Under Chaos,"

72
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,870
I presented both the learning-from-experience
and evolutionary explanations a decade before

73
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:20,870
Wilke and Barrett, and applied them to both
Gambler's and Hot Hand Fallacies. My evidence

74
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,280
was a demonstration that humans are good at
short-range predictions of chaotic processes.

75
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,810
To do this, I coded a chaotic-sequence-generating
algorithm with a parameter that controlled

76
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,330
the extent to which the resulting sequence
was anti-persistent (frequently oscillating

77
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,980
as would be expected by Gambler's Fallacy) or persistent (infrequently oscillating

78
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,970
as expected by Hot Hand beliefs). You can
see examples of both kinds in this slide.

79
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:56,240
The left-hand graph is an anti-persistent
pattern, and the right-hand graph is a persistent

80
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,900
pattern.
Participants in my study were randomly assigned

81
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,639
to either tracking a persistent or anti-persistent
process, and after seeing 100 iterations of

82
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,990
their sequence they were asked to predict
its next value for 50 more iterations. They

83
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,090
were also asked to do the same for a random
sequence containing exactly the same values

84
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:24,090
as their chaotic sequence (but randomly re-ordered).
Of course, no one was any good at predicting

85
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:31,139
the random sequence. I suspect that when we
see a random sequence like coin-tosses, we actually

86
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,909
misread it as an anti-persistent process and
therefore fall for Gambler's Fallacy. But

87
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,789
everyone was quite good at predicting the
chaotic sequence (the average correlation between

88
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,779
their predictions and the sequence itself
was .68, and some people's correlations were

89
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:56,779
around .9). Moreover, they were equally good
at predicting persistent and anti-persistent

90
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,420
processes.
Those of you who have played my Investor games

91
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,330
have been predicting the same three types
of sequences. InvestorRandom has a stock that

92
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:16,330
fluctuates randomly, InvestorChaos1's stock
is chaotic and anti-persistent, and InvestorChaos2's

93
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,860
stock is chaotic and persistent. Many of you
will have found that you could learn the tricks

94
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,450
to making money in the InvestorChaos 1 and
2 games. The best strategies will closely

95
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:34,800
resemble Gambler's Fallacy for InvestorChaos
1 and Hot Hand Fallacy for InvestorChaos 2.

96
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,880
So, Ayton and Fischer's learning-from-experience
proposition received solid support before

97
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,310
they wrote their paper. The Wilke-Barrett
evolutionary explanation got a circumstantial

98
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:52,310
evidential boost too. Indeed, we didn't evolve
in casinos. We evolved in environments full

99
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:59,350
of anti-persistent processes, like prey populations,
and persistent processes, like the weather.

100
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,790
We're adept at spotting which is which. We
expect the processes in the world around us

101
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:10,200
to operate as if they have "memory", and for
good reason: They usually do. Gambler's and

102
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,990
Hot Hand Fallacies serve us quite well-- outside
the casino.
