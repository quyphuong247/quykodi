There is a widely held intuition that if we
use a well-reasoned, evidence-based approach

2
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,989
to making decisions under uncertainty then
we'll make the right decision most of the

3
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:36,600
time. Sure, we'll make some bad calls but
the majority of the time we'll get it right.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,100
Or will we? It turns out that there are circumstances
where we can do everything right in making

5
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,530
our decision, and still get the decision wrong
most of the time. I'll provide some real-world

6
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:54,309
illustrations of these circumstances to demonstrate
that they are surprisingly common.

7
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,750
What does any of this have to do with the
futility of seeking greater certainty? Even

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,440
in the difficult circumstances I've just mentioned,
greater certainty would improve our decision

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,160
making. The catch, as we'll see, is that the
amount of certainty required to do this is

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,090
unattainable.

11
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:20,090
Here's an example from law enforcement. Suppose
you're the commanding officer in a local police

12
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:27,429
jurisdiction, and you have to decide how to
allocate resources to a missing person case.

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,500
A worst-case scenario is that the missing
person ends up as a murder victim. Although

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,640
police are required to treat all missing persons
cases seriously, as most do not involve foul

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,140
play, it would be grossly inefficient to treat
all missing persons as potential homicides.

16
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,280
A large majority of missing persons are found
safe and well, within a week of their going

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,890
missing, and almost all of them are found
within a month. Nevertheless, according to

18
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,890
standard procedure, if the missing person
isn't found within 24 hours , you'll undertake

19
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,450
a risk analysis, considering issues such as
whether the circumstances are suspicious or

20
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:15,060
out of character, or there is evidence that
a crime may have been committed.

21
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,110
What would be your best approach to this risk
analysis, and how likely would you be to come

22
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:28,060
to the right decision? A landmark British
study examined 32,705 cases of missing persons

23
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,650
in the UK between 2000 and 2002, and determined
that 0.6 percent were found dead, although

24
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,350
not necessary victims of homicide. That's
a very low percentage, and it turns out to

25
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,390
be the source of a major headache for you,
as the commander responsible for deciding

26
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,250
what resources to allocate to your case.
You have years of experience, wisdom handed

27
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,250
down from seasoned investigators who came
before you, and you've read the relevant literature.

28
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,950
You know that where a missing person is found
to have been a victim of foul play, risk factors

29
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,810
include age and sex, involvement in prostitution
or drug trade, last being seeing in a public

30
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,660
place and an absence of a history of suicide
attempts or mental health problems.

31
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,160
So, you're going to make a decision whether
to allocate more resources to a missing persons

32
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,680
case investigation based on some diagnostic
criteria which I'll call "D". The criteria

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,569
included in D are all of the indicators that
the missing person may have died. There are

34
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,569
four commonly used indicators of evaluating
how good D is:

35
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:46,230
Sensitivity, the probability that D was present
when a missing person was found dead;

36
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:53,230
Specificity, the probability that D was absent
when a missing person was found alive;

37
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,630
Positive Predictive Value, the probability
that the person was found dead when D was

38
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,819
present; and
Negative Predictive Value, the probability

39
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:09,430
that the person was found alive when D was
absent.

40
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,470
Sensitivity and specificity measure the probability
of finding that D is present when there is

41
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:21,289
a death but absent when there is no death.
Predictive value, on the other hand, tells

42
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:27,380
us the probability of making a correct diagnosis
(death versus no death) based on D.

43
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Now, suppose D has a sensitivity of .99 and
specificity of .99. These levels are far better

44
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,389
than can be obtained from the otherwise worthwhile
predictors identified by the UK study, so

45
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:47,930
we're dealing with an unrealistically high
level of certainty here. The table in this

46
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,840
slide shows how well D would perform in distinguishing
between cases ending in death and cases not

47
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,120
ending in death.
Because sensitivity is .99, D is absent only

48
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,120
in .01 times 198 or just 2 cases involving deaths, and
correctly present in the remaining 196. Likewise,

49
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,990
because specificity is .99, D is present in
.01 times 32507 or 325 cases that do not involve

50
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,580
death. That is, there are 325 missing persons
with D who will be found alive. But

51
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,150
325 is large compared to the number of correctly
identified deaths (196). So positive predictive

52
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,550
value is poor: The probability that the person
will be found dead when D is present = 196/(196

53
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,439
+ 325) is just .376. The rate of incorrect positive
diagnosis, that is, a "false positive", is

54
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:45,210
1 - .376 or .624. If you, as commander, decided
to allocate more resources to cases where

55
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,120
D is present you could expect to be wrong
about 62% of the time.

56
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,719
Can this false positive rate be reduced? An
obvious and frequently recommended remedy

57
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,719
is further investigation into factors that
may predict the likelihood of a missing person

58
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:05,289
ending up dead and, conditional on death,
being a homicide victim. These investigations

59
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:11,949
could be combined with sophisticated analysis
of the kind employed in the UK study, to improve

60
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,529
either sensitivity, specificity, or both.
But how effective can we expect this remedy

61
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:22,969
to be? It turns out that improving sensitivity
would have only a negligible effect on positive

62
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:29,169
predictive value. What about improving specificity?
That looks promising initially, until you

63
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,939
crunch the numbers. To get to the point where
positive predictive value was an even-money

64
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:40,939
bet (.5) would require specificity to be .994.
To move positive predictive value to .9 would

65
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,909
require specificity to be .9993. Thus the
test would have to be incredibly accurate

66
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:54,719
in order to avoid being wrong most of the
time. These are unachievable standards.

67
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,240
Police will inevitably face a considerable
error-rate in making resource allocation decisions

68
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,650
regarding missing persons cases. Of course,
this does not imply that improving predictions

69
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,619
of homicide in missing persons cases is entirely
futile, but it is futile if we expect such

70
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:16,789
improvements to raise the probability of a
correct decision to a desirable level. Instead,

71
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:23,619
you, as commander, are very likely to be chastised
by higher-ups and perhaps the media for "wasting"

72
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:28,499
money and resources on all those cases where
D was present but the missing person turned

73
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,210
up alive and well.

74
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:39,059
The source of our difficulty is that the outcomes
we want to predict or diagnose occurs at a

75
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:45,360
low rate in the population. The rarer this
outcome is, the more likely that even with

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,669
very high sensitivity and specificity rates,
we will suffer from a high false-positive

77
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,279
rate.

78
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:58,719
This kind of problem occurs regularly in preventative
medical testing. For example pregnant women

79
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,050
may wish to test for the possibility that
their unborn baby has Downs Syndrome. According

80
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:10,300
to an Australian government health assessment
document released in 2002, when used as a

81
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,689
single modality, the standard screening by
measurement of Nuchal Translucency in the

82
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:22,689
first trimester has a detection rate for Downs
of approximately 73% to 82%. Additional ultrasound

83
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,740
cues can further increase detection rates
for Down syndrome to around 95%.

84
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,740
The table in this slide shows the most optimistic
scenario according to those figures, i.e.,

85
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:45,089
sensitivity and specificity of 95%. At the
time, about 12.8 per 10,000 births yielded

86
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,110
a baby with Downs, so I've included that rate
in the table. Downs Syndrome is rare. The

87
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:57,040
result, as you can see, is a positive predictive
value of just 2.38%. Given a test result that

88
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,089
says the baby has Downs, the probability that
it really does have Downs is about 2.4 chances

89
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:07,870
in 100. If these procedures were applied to
all pregnant women, there would be many needlessly

90
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,870
upset pregnant women and partners--about 97.6%
of the positive test results would be false.

91
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,190
In July 2010 there was a furore over a study
published in the Journal of the American Medical

92
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:28,190
Association. The study found that of 2176
participants free of HIV infection who received

93
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:37,430
a vaccine product, 908 tested positive for
HIV. That's a false positive rate of about

94
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,839
41.7%. Now, suppose a successful vaccine is
developed but it also has this reactivity

95
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,019
problem, with about 42% of vaccinated people
testing positive for HIV. In any country where

96
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:52,910
the rate of HIV infection is low, the combination
of a large proportion of the population being

97
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,290
vaccinated and tested could be a major disaster
because a large proportion of people would

98
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:05,120
be told they have HIV when they do not. This
is not to say that an HIV vaccine is a bad

99
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,160
idea; the point is that it could play havoc
with HIV detection.

100
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,170
The chief difference between the medical preventative
testing quandary and the police commander's

101
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,629
problem is that the negative consequences
of the wrong diagnosis fall on the patient

102
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:27,170
instead of the decision maker. Yet this issue
is seldom aired in public debates regarding

103
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,980
medical testing. Perhaps understandably, the
bulk of medical research effort in this domain

104
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,540
goes into devising more accurate tests. But
hang on: In the Downs test scenario, even

105
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:46,540
with a sensitivity rate of 100% the specificity rate
would have to be 99.87% to raise the positive

106
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:53,339
predictive value to a mere 50%. And for a
positive predictive value of 90%? Sensitivity

107
00:10:53,339 --> 00:11:00,339
would have to be about 99.99%, a crazily unrealistic
target. Realistically, the tests will never

108
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,569
be accurate enough to avoid the problem posed
by low positive predictive values for rare

109
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:07,850
disorders.

110
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,819
What can a decision maker do? The final point
to all this is that in settings where you're

111
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:18,579
doomed to a high decisional error-rate despite
using the best available methods, it may be

112
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:24,000
better to direct your energies toward handling
the flak instead of persisting in a futile

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,050
quest for unattainably accurate predictors
or diagnostic cues. Greater certainty won't

114
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,699
help when the required degree of certainty
simply is out of reach.
