Hi, I&#39;m Michael Smithson and I&#39;m Gabriele Bammer

1
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:31,090
And we&#39;re the course conveners for this MOOC on Ignorance! We are presenting the MOOC in

2
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,820
two five week segments.

3
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,470
In this introductory talk we&#39;re going to tell you about ourselves, as well as something

4
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,750
about how we&#39;ve designed this MOOC and what we hope you&#39;ll get out of it.

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,239
So Mike, I&#39;m curious to hear how you got interested in Ignorance.

6
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:54,239
Well, I was an undergraduate math student. At first I thought mathematics was a fortress

7
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:01,659
of absolute certainty. But eventually I realized that there are deep unknowns even in mathematics,

8
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:08,100
such as the nature of mathematical proof or the kinds of paradox that can crop up there.

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,990
Later, when I was doing a PhD in sociology, I encountered the thesis that knowledge is

10
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:21,170
largely socially constructed. It occurred to me that ignorance also is socially constructed.

11
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:27,159
At the time, no one was working on that. So, I had the good fortune to do pioneering work

12
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,109
on how ignorance is socially constructed, and what people do with it.

13
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,939
What are the issues about ignorance that have most interested you and how will we see that

14
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,759
reflected in the course?

15
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,350
I find it really interesting how most of us are so focused on knowledge as an answer to

16
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:53,350
all our problems that ignorance gets demonized and sidelined. We have blind-spots about ignorance.

17
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,079
This course is designed to bring ignorance onto centre stage, so that we can see how

18
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,979
people actively choose and construct ignorance, the roles it plays and the uses it has in

19
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,899
cognition and social interaction.

20
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,590
And what are you working on now?

21
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,870
I&#39;ve long been interested in the question of whether people think and act as if there

22
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,030
are different kinds of unknowns. I have a couple of research projects now on how people

23
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:29,030
make decisions with vague or ambiguous information, versus conflicting information.

24
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,560
So Gabriele, how did you get interested in Ignorance?

25
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,310
Well Mike, you may not remember this, but it was actually at a seminar you gave back

26
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,650
in around 2003. At that stage I hadn&#39;t heard of you and I had to hike over to the other

27
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,269
side of campus, so I was obviously intrigued by the topic.

28
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,409
And it paid off. I can&#39;t remember now whether it was at the seminar or later that I had

29
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:01,110
a major ah-ha moment when I realised that it&#39;s not enough to try to make change happen

30
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:08,110
based on what we know, we also need to take into account what we don&#39;t know. If you ignore

31
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,079
the unknown, you can end up with nasty surprises and adverse consequences.

32
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,269
What were you working on?

33
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,659
I was just starting the work that I&#39;m still engaged in, which is figuring out better ways

34
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:28,659
to deal with complex problems. There are two parts to this that people commonly think about.

35
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,599
First is improving our knowledge about the problem by bringing together insights from

36
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,959
different disciplines and also from people who are either affected by the problem or

37
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,769
who are in a position to do something about the problem. The second part is how that knowledge

38
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:52,569
is then used to effect change: Change in government policy or in business practice or community

39
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,409
behaviours.

40
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:01,170
But there is also a third piece that people just don&#39;t think about that I realised through

41
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,769
your seminar, and that is ignorance. If we make government policy or try to change citizen

42
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:12,489
behaviour based only on what we know, we can end up in very treacherous waters, because

43
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,269
something we&#39;ve ignored or are ignorant of may be important.

44
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:22,800
To cut a long story short, I&#39;ve been arguing that we need to build a repository of methods

45
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,720
for dealing with all these different aspects of complex problems and I&#39;ve been so bold

46
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,870
as to suggest that this could be part of a new discipline which I suggest could be called

47
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,660
Integration and Implementation Sciences.

48
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,270
That&#39;s interesting. So how does all that relate to this course?

49
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:49,470
I&#39;ll be looking particularly at what the understandings about ignorance that you present mean for

50
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,830
dealing with complex problems. So each week, I&#39;ll draw together some of the key insights

51
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,449
from your presentations and highlight how they help us deal more effectively with complex

52
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,680
problems.

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,680
One of the things that&#39;s intrigued both of us is that each discipline and professional

54
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,780
area has only a partial view of ignorance. Our courses can be relevant to a number of

55
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:22,789
disciplines, ranging right through the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts.

56
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,620
They also have relevance for professions such as medicine, law, clinical psychology, and

57
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,389
engineering. They&#39;re pitched at an undergraduate level but can easily be extended. Because

58
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:41,990
they&#39;re only 5 weeks long, students or instructors can continue on with material from their own

59
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,930
domain. I&#39;ll be doing this in psychology, for instance, so that third-year undergraduate

60
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,910
psychology students here will do one of the courses and then continue the rest of the

61
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,550
semester studying the psychology of ignorance.

62
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,259
What I&#39;ve been interested in is that it&#39;s no-one&#39;s business to take a comprehensive

63
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:05,979
view of ignorance. Indeed in the first project you and I did together, we brought together

64
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:10,970
20 different perspectives on ignorance and realised how fascinating it is to try to develop

65
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,970
a more comprehensive view. We had a physicist, a statistician, a jazz musician, an historian,

66
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:23,930
a theologian, and many more and put their perspectives together in this book. We&#39;ll

67
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,729
draw on some of those chapters during the course and also invite some of the participants

68
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:34,470
in that project to give guest lectures, especially in Ignorance II.

69
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:41,470
In conclusion, let me provide a quick overview. In Ignorance I, we&#39;ll investigate how we think

70
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,479
about ignorance, where ignorance comes from, and when ignorance benefits us and when it

71
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,400
doesn&#39;t. Ignorance II explores the social and political functions of ignorance, how

72
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,560
it is dealt with in various disciplines and professions, and effective strategies for

73
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,940
decision making and managing with ignorance. Both courses will include video lectures,

74
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,169
online discussion forums, regular assessment by quizzes, opportunities to find out what

75
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:15,800
your own &quot;ignorance profile&quot; is, and even games.

76
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,529
We hope you&#39;ll find the topic of ignorance as rich and fascinating as we do.
