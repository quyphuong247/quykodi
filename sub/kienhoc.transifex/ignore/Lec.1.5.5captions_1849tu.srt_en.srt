Music is not the only artistic sphere in which
unknowns can have an important role. Once

2
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,590
you start looking, you'll find artists playing
with unknowns in nearly all realms, from drama

3
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,480
to digital and this isn't new. In the arts,
traditions of exploiting chance elements,

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,800
improvising, relinquishing control to other
agents and forces go back a long way. Sasha

Grishin is an art historian, his research
areas include nineteenth and twentieth century

6
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,930
art and contemporary art, especially Australian
and European art. Also medieval art, especially

7
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,379
Byzantine and Russian art. Professor Grishin
was elected to Fellowship of the Australian

8
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:05,379
Academy of the Humanities in 2004 and awarded
an Order of Australia for service to the visual

9
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:12,409
arts and to contemporary Australian artists
as an educator, critic and writer and as an

10
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,530
art historian in 2005. He was kind enough
to let me interview him on the roles that

11
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,530
unknowns play in the visual arts. Sasha, several
years you wrote a chapter for Gabriel and

12
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:36,749
my book, describing how artists harness and
cultivate uncertainty in their work. I think

13
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,020
probably a lot of us think of art still as
something that requires a lot of control and

14
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:52,020
mastery, so it's this vision of an almost
omnipotent artist, fully in control or his

15
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,850
or medium or technique. So how does that sit
with making things uncertain or having accidents

16
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:03,829
or anything like that?

17
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:10,009
I think basically there's two different ways
of thinking about. One is to say that an artist

18
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,930
is a complete control freak when it concerns
materials and some artists are like that.

19
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,569
In other words, the thing is all worked out,
almost like a battle campaign. Yes there's

20
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:26,420
a small sketch made, then that's made into
a larger design and that's transferred to

21
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,910
canvas, then bits and pieces are colored in
and the whole thing is resolved very much

22
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,840
in a very rational, certain manner. There's
a completely different philosophy of art making

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,840
which is to surrender to chance. Surrender
to uncertainty and thinking about that recently

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,160
I think it underlies a rather fundamental
difference between, if you like, a humanist

25
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,590
perspective and an anti-humanist perspective.
I'll be very careful to explain what I mean

26
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,590
by that. Now a humanist perspective is an
idea as man as the measure of all things.

27
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,730
The person is the most important thing and
everything is relative to it. An anti-humanist

28
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:24,730
perspective is, as it implies, the exact opposite.
Man is one composite element, all other parts

29
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,820
of nature have, if you like, equal importance,
so that a dog, a fly and a tick become, if

30
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,930
you like, parts of that universe and have
their own authentic authority and autonomy

31
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,270
about it. Very early in the piece there was
a movement in Europe that was borne around

32
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:54,110
the period of the First World War, the Great
War that is referred to generally as Dada.

33
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,110
The artists of Dada essentially made this
idea of chance as a central created principle.

34
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,780
One of the most famous examples was, there
was a particular artist who goes under several

35
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,780
different names, but let's just call him Hans
Arp. He made a drawing and he wasn't happy

36
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,039
with the drawing so he tore it up, threw it
over his shoulder and left the room. The next

37
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:25,550
morning he back and saw where the bits and
pieces had landed and thought, wow this is

38
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,789
something I couldn't actually achieve with
my conscious mind but somehow by allowing

39
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:37,789
chance to play a role, then this is rearranged
in a particular order or pattern that is far

40
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,330
more interesting and creative than what I
could do with my rational controlling mind.

41
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:52,330
Is this solely a modern concept or does it
go further back than that? I mean are there

42
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,440
artists before World War One who did these
sorts of things?

43
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Well, yes I think probably before the Great
War in art history, frequently it goes under

44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,639
the name of inspiration. Now where does that
germ of inspiration come from? Now one of

45
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,710
the greatest control freaks in the history
of art was Leonardo da Vinci. He's a person

46
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,710
who spent hours looking at the motion of water,
hours looking at geological formations, making

47
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:33,430
precise studies of the human anatomy. All
of these elements, he saw was in some ways

48
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,470
empowering the artist to become a God like
character, one who can create. So in other

49
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,940
words, this idea that if there is some sort
of omnipotent God, then the artist, really

50
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,389
to become a God like character, must have
the same skill box as God has, must know geology,

51
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,400
must know natural sciences, mathematics and
everything else. But, and this is a huge and

52
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,570
exciting but, how do you actually started
work of art? And in one of this throw away

53
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:10,570
lines in Il Trattato della Pittura, Leonardo
says, well one day you'll be just sitting,

54
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:18,870
sipping from a glass of wine and you'll be
looking at this rock ledge opposite, where

55
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,960
you'll notice pee stains and looking at this
most incredible patterns within those pee

56
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,919
stains you'll see landscapes and other things
that you're conscious mind could never have

57
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,090
imagined. So you feel like there's this idea
that you're looking for the chance occurrence

58
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:47,090
in nature which is the spark of inspiration
that leads to the creation of these works.

59
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,120
So one could say that this whole idea of looking
outside that which is definable, controlled,

60
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,330
that which is very finite, does go back a
very long time.

61
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:08,330
So after Dada are there major movements that
really are mainly about harnessing uncertainty

62
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:15,870
or does this remain kind of, sort of a side
show, in some-----

63
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,870
Dada - sorry I've interrupted you. Dada never
dies. Dada gained its conscious expression

64
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,690
at the beginning of the twentieth century
but subsequently whether you call it Neo Dada

65
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:36,690
or give it different titles, it continues.
Once that principle of chance had been harnessed

66
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,370
by artists, then yes it goes into a lot of
directions. Frequently people involved in

67
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:52,340
environmental art. They are consciously working
and trying to bring into their artwork the

68
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,740
voice which is not of the artist. Now that's
slightly different from what you and I were

69
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:08,740
speaking about earlier. If art and the surrealists
believe that somehow uncertainty unlocks,

70
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,060
if you like, the subconscious, artists working
within the environmental movement, people

71
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,840
like Richard Long in England or John Wolseley
in Australia, they're more concerned with

72
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,090
the ideas saying, well the artist perhaps
should be more like a medium and to allow

73
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:34,899
the other elements of nature to speak through
the artist. Say in particularly in the case

74
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:41,899
of John Wolseley, he would do such things
as, after there's a bush fire go with sheets

75
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:49,949
of paper and allow them to be dragged over
the burnt charcoal twigs. One of the most

76
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:58,460
remarkable things that he found is that no
two burnt trees had the same voice. Some of

77
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,600
us who are not familiar with the bush intimately,
look and say well this looks like there's

78
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,460
been a bush fire here, everything is black
and burnt, but actually a particular type

79
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,790
of Banksia makes a particular mark after it's
been burnt. A Eucalypt makes a different sort

80
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,060
of mark, a Grevillia makes a different sort
of mark. So almost when he puts all these

81
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,710
marks together, they create an environment,
an ecosystem in which now the missing living

82
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:33,710
elements are there. So nature starts to, if
you like, create a self-portrait in its own

83
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:41,170
terms. The artist becomes almost like a medium
or a manipulator to allow this self-portrait

84
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,220
to appear.

85
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,220
Okay, so at the extreme then the artist isn't
actually making marks him or herself? But

86
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,610
instead, animals or insects or plants.

87
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:01,610
Yes I mean for example just leading to the
case of Wolseley because simply he's an Australian

88
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,240
artist, he came here in 1976, so he's been
here for a number years, although he did have

89
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:14,240
an English reputation before he arrived. One
of his favorite ploys is to actually take

90
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:23,100
a sheet of paper, perhaps have a drawing on
it, rip it in half, put half the drawing into

91
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:31,330
a folio and the other half secreted in a hollow
tree under a dry desert sand and leave it

92
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:41,560
there, sometimes for a number of years and
then come back, extract it and join them up.

93
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,020
Just have a look what's happened to that paper
that's been out in the elements. The markings

94
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:54,020
made by insects, seepages, various sort of
ferric oxides that transfer to these. There's

95
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:02,180
become these wondrous patterns that are created
within this and yes as you put it correctly

96
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:09,060
I don't think the artist sees - is very much
opposite to the Leonardo da Vinci idea, the

97
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,160
artist is the God creator, here the artist
is, if you like, the facilitator. The artist

98
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,920
is here to see if you can give nature its
own voice.

99
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,920
So has anybody - are artists taking this approach
to, in a sense the artificial environment?

100
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,779
Yes you've got that happening, but also if
you think about it with say an artist like

101
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:41,779
Rosemary Gascoigne, now she didn't actually
paint things, she assembled things. But I

102
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,640
think one of the beauties of her work is that
she would assemble things that had a certain

103
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,080
patina already created in nature. She quite
often would use artificial areas of things

104
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,080
like road signs which she then would cut up,
rearrange, put together and what was very

105
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:07,339
important was those road signs already carried
with them, if you like, traces of earlier

106
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,360
existences. So when you actually to them and
some of her works can be thought of in terms

107
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,990
of environment images or landscape images,
they have a certain power about it. Some of

108
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,660
it's because she arranged things in a particular
way, other things that she's had actually

109
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,839
the genius to see things with fresh eyes and
suddenly to realise that they can be pulled

110
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,750
together and we all start seeing things differently.

111
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:40,750
So do you foresee any further developments
along these sorts of lines or have artists

112
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,680
kind of scoped out the artistic possibilities
there?

113
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,680
To be honest I always think all of these things
as adding to the artist's toolbox. It's really

114
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:05,370
I think a question of the creative use of
all of these different strategies and techniques

115
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:14,230
and also feeling the confidence that you don't
actually have to control everything. You don't

116
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:21,060
have to sort of be a dictator but you can
actually allow many other - a polyphony of

117
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:28,060
voices to enter into your composition but
have that, like in Rosemary Gascoigne's case,

118
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:35,310
the genius to be able to hear them and guide
the process into something that is resolved

119
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,769
that you and I would look at and say, this
is the most incredible, this is the most wonderful------

120
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:44,589
Well, have we pretty well exhausted everything?
As far as I can tell ...

121
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:48,950
No no, there's nothing specific you wanted
me to talk about, is there?

122
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,279
Not that I can think of.
Well, OK. My pleasure.

123
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:52,600
Great.
