00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,440
The first lecture in this week introduced
us to some of the ways in which ignorance

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:31,440
is deliberately manufactured, often to serve
economic, social, or political interests.

4
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,160
We're going to move further into that territory
in this lecture. We'll begin by examining

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,960
how curiosity is socially inhibited and the
motivations and social forces behind that.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Then we'll focus on how ignorance can be strategically
used for social control and governance. We'll

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,040
find that the same unknowns sometimes can
serve both sides of a dispute.

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,989
Next-of-kin to withholding information from
people is preventing or inhibiting people

9
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,989
from finding information out for themselves.
We can think of this as curbing curiosity.

10
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,729
In Western traditions there is an old saying
that "curiosity killed the cat", although

11
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,479
a popular riposte declares "satisfaction brought
it back".

12
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,450
Why would we want to curb our own or others'
curiosity? To begin with, let's start with

13
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,310
some relatively benign examples. First-hand
reality testing and knowledge seeking can

14
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,009
be risky. Ask any hardy childhood survivor
who jumped off the roof with an umbrella for

15
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,590
a parachute or a home-made pair of wings.
There are plenty of things we avoid trying

16
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,619
out because we're quite sure beforehand they
would harm us.

17
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:47,840
Instead, as we discussed in week 1 much of
the time we learn things second- or third-hand,

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,329
that is, vicariously. We humans share with
various other species the capacity for vicarious

19
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:58,829
learning (finding out consequences of acts
by watching others try them out), and there

20
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,619
is an evolutionary advantage in that facility
because it eliminates the need for every one

21
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:09,729
of us to take the same risks. There also is
the immediate practical advantage of saving

22
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:15,190
time and effort.
Social reality-testing also can be dangerous,

23
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,170
albeit in a different sense from physical
risks. The main risks are social disapproval

24
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:27,770
or rejection. One tradition in social psychology
is a type of reality-testing known as a "breaching

25
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,720
experiment" (also known as "Garfinkeling",
named after Harold Garfinkel). There are actually

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,590
two kinds of breaching experiments. The first
investigates people's reactions to the breaching

27
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,900
of a known social rule or norm. Stanley Milgram
famously had New York university students

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,640
ask a seated person to give up their seat
on a subway. The second kind is more akin

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,370
to what children do, namely discovering an
implicit rule or norm by breaching it. Is

30
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,080
it just a convention, or a bona fide norm
that everyone stands facing the door in an

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,140
elevator? Which kinds of music performances
prohibit chatting among audience members?

32
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:14,140
So, a second major motive for curbing curiosity
is when it violates customs, norms, values,

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,440
or sacred tenets. For example, all societies
have topics that are off-limits for inquiry,

34
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,310
unless special circumstances permit it. Often
these topics include matters such as sex or

35
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,380
death that involve cultural taboos, which
we also discussed in week 1. But other enquiries  

36
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,380
 may be forbidden because they are deemed inappropriate
in particular contexts. The Illegal and Inappropriate

37
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,070
Interview Questions for Dummies webpage lists
the following topics that American employers

38
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:53,070
are not to ask of prospective employees: Age,
birthplace, marital status, disability, national

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,090
origin, religion, race, or sex. Most of these
are considered inappropriate because they

40
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,930
signal that the employer may discriminate
against an interviewee on the basis of their

41
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,320
answers.
Questioning also may be discouraged because

42
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:16,320
it threatens or challenges social relations.
Because a question commands a response, question-asking

43
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:23,250
is a kind of challenge to the person being
interrogated. Anthropological work on question-asking

44
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,600
in the late 1970's suggested that in some
cultures, question-asking is strongly curtailed

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,970
even in educational settings. Questioning
challenges a teacher's authority.

46
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:40,970
It's a short step from electing not to investigate
forbidden topics or not to try dangerous experiments

47
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,780
ourselves to striving to prevent our nearest
and dearest from trying them as well. A particularly

48
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,570
vexing question for parents and teachers is
whether to allow children to find out certain

49
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,950
things for themselves. There are obvious and
powerful motivations for parents to protect

50
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,350
their children from risks by curbing their
curiosity. What well-motivated and loving

51
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,360
parent doesn't want their children to avoid
injury or other mishaps?

52
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,190
My brothers and I were allowed to experiment
with the natural world and take physical risks

53
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:22,139
that by today's child-safety standards might
sound almost criminally permissive. My teenage

54
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,330
experiments included building a 10-foot tall
rocket that flew more than three miles high.

55
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,760
I became a scientist and scholar in good part
because my parents encouraged my attempts

56
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:39,120
to find out things for myself.
Things have tightened up considerably since

57
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,120
I was a child, and I am far from alone in
noticing this. In his engrossing memoir, Oliver

58
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:53,250
Sacks, about my age and reared in the UK instead
of the USA, recalls how readily he could obtain

59
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,480
hazardous compounds such as potassium cyanide
or hydrofluoric acid during his childhood

60
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,040
love-affair with chemistry. In a footnote
he remarks that now "none of these chemicals

61
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,690
can be bought, and even school or museum laboratories
are increasingly confined to reagents that

62
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:17,690
are less hazardous, and less fun." The safer
chemistry sets also are less educational.

63
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,550
Why are children under stricter supervision
when it comes to curiosity? Some authors have

64
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,280
been writing for more than a decade about
what they say is a "culture of fear" that

65
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,260
has come to dominate some Western societies
as a result of the "risk explosion", the general

66
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:41,260
increased awareness of risks. Furedi's (2001)
book "Paranoid Parenting" documents a trend

67
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,240
in British society to extend adult supervision
into all aspects of children's lives. He cites

68
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,150
examples such as schools banning traditional
children's games and contact sports, and the

69
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,169
increased reluctance of teachers to organize
school outings or field trips for fear of

70
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:06,410
litigation. Where we used to speak of accidents,
now it's all about risk minimization, negligence,

71
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,180
and blame.
Now let's turn our attention to the functions

72
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,889
that ignorance can serve for social control
and governance, starting with a couple of

73
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:22,320
examples. In a recent paper, sociologist Linsey
McGoey highlights four strategic uses of ignorance

74
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,930
in the controversy over the licensing of Ketek,
an antibiotic drug that was found to be toxic

75
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,930
to the liver. First, the manufacturer, Sanofi-Aventis,
employed risk-detection systems that actually

76
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,990
obscured warning signs. Second, they, along
with American Food and Drug Administration

77
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,600
regulators, selectively withheld information
from the FDA independent advisory committee.

78
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Third, they directed regulatory staff to remain
silent about concerns over drug safety. Fourth,

79
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,740
they ignored the implications of known limitations
of methods for detecting drug risks. To her

80
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,770
list we can add one more: One of the Sanofi
researchers involved in the Ketek trials was

81
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:13,770
indicted for fraudulent research practices.
Here's a second example. A Washington Post

82
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,560
article in 1986 described a ruling by the
American Justice Department, that employers

83
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,850
could dismiss individuals with AIDS as long
as the employers' action arose from a fear

84
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:31,620
of contagion. In other words, employers' ignorance
of the fact that AIDS did not pose a health

85
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,620
danger in the workplace gave them permission
to discriminate against AIDS victims.

86
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,180
These examples include strategies we've already
become familiar with in this course: Deliberate

87
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:51,180
concealment, suppression of dissent, and selective
lies. Nonetheless, as McGoey points out, the

88
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:58,649
examples also indicate the ways that acquiring
and maintaining ignorance can be more advantageous

89
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,589
than possessing knowledge.
Much current theorizing about strategic ignorance

90
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:09,759
hinges on assertions about the functions that
ignorance has for those who generate or maintain

91
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,759
it. This idea is not new. In their 1949 paper,
sociologists Wilbert Moore and Melvin Tumin

92
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,879
described five functions of ignorance: Preserving
privilege; reinforcing traditional values;

93
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,240
preserving fairness in competition; maintaining
stereotypes; and motivating effort in the

94
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,339
face of unknown outcomes. Moore and Tumin's
analysis may sound as though ignorance mainly

95
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:42,439
serves conservative values and causes. But
it's important to realize that ignorance has

96
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:47,569
its functions regardless of one's political
orientation.

97
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:53,319
For instance, doubt can serve both sides of
a political and scientific controversy simultaneously.

98
00:09:53,319 --> 00:10:00,319
I wrote an account in 1980 of how both environmentalists
and industrialists used initial uncertainties

99
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,819
about the effects of chlorofluorocarbons on
the ozone layer to bolster their agendas.

100
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:13,619
Each side had seized on one of the two most
common responses to profound uncertainty.

101
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:20,619
The environmentalists' position was a precursor
of the precautionary principle: Ban chlorofluorocarbons

102
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:25,929
until it can be proven that they are not harmful.
The industrialists' argument reflected a well-known

103
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:32,079
status-quo bias: Allow chlorofluorocarbon
production and marketing to continue until

104
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,769
they are proven harmful. Each camp had clear
uses for ignorance in aiding their cause.

105
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:44,040
A recent chapter by Steve Rayner on geo-engineering
points to a similar bifurcation in the uses

106
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,319
of scientific ignorance. One group of engineering
experts favors research into the prospect

107
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:56,129
of using stratospheric aerosols to mitigate
the effects of global warming. Another group

108
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:02,619
of experts opposes this research. Both sides
agree that we currently lack the knowledge

109
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:08,600
necessary to deploy stratospheric aerosols
effectively or safely. Research advocates

110
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,449
claim that improved computer modeling along
with small-scale experiments can be cautiously

111
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:20,920
scaled up in such a way as to avoid any irreversible
negative effects and eventually produce the

112
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,699
knowledge needed. Opponents argue that the
extensive complexity and uncertainties in

113
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:31,980
climate and ecosystems responses preclude
adequate modeling of stratospheric aerosol

114
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,980
deployment, and that experimentation is bound
to result in catastrophe. So, the main issue

115
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:44,329
in dispute is whether ignorance about these
matters is reducible or not, in other words

116
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:50,480
whether this is a case of resolvable ignorance
or negative knowledge.

117
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,490
The geo-engineering example also demonstrates
the utility of being able to dictate what

118
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:01,490
can and cannot be known. Expert status often
depends as much on maintaining a monopoly

119
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:07,910
over what is difficult or impossible to know
as it does on a monopoly over specialist knowledge.

120
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:14,170
So, specific kinds of ignorance have different
functions and uses. In this case, reducible

121
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,309
ignorance serves the interests of the pro-research
experts whereas irreducible ignorance serves

122
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:26,309
the interests of the anti-research experts.
We've seen how motives for curbing curiosity

123
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,720
in children can become amplified as adults
become increasingly aware of risks and as

124
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,749
a culture becomes more litigious as a result.
We've also seen how specific kinds of ignorance

125
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:45,679
can be useful for promoting political agendas,
avoiding culpability, and maintaining power

126
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:52,119
and privilege. And we also have seen that
the same ignorance can be useful simultaneously

127
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:58,839
for both sides of a dispute. What happens
when there is an opportunity to gain new knowledge

128
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:05,839
that could be used for both tremendous good
and tremendous evil? This is what we'll investigate

129
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:06,739
in the next lecture.
