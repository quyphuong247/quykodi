So far, we've noted several kinds of costs
for gaining knowledge or for knowledge itself.

2
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,960
Knowledge gaining has time-and-effort costs
of searching for and processing information,

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,550
and so we rely heavily on third-hand pre-packaged
knowledge. We've also found that there are

4
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:47,300
plenty of motivations for both temporary and
permanent ignorance. In fact, we've seen that

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,550
temporary ignorance has important implications
for us when it comes to entertainment, learning

6
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,550
and discovery, creativity, and of course personal freedom.
We've also seen that there are defensible

7
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,750
reasons to decide that there are things we
never want to know.

8
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,880
But are there any other costs of knowing that
would be sufficient to tip the balance in

9
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,880
favour of ignorance? Indeed there are, and
we'll explore them in this lecture and throughout

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,530
the remainder of this week. To do this, we
need a few concepts and distinctions that

11
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,849
will help us make sense of these costs.
Probably the most important distinction is

12
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:37,599
between costs of knowing to the knower and
costs of knowing to others. Getting your own

13
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,840
genetic code sequenced, which is rapidly becoming
affordable for many people in developed countries,

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,840
will inevitably throw up findings in the form
of unexpected genetically based risks of various

15
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:57,979
diseases and disorders. Some of the findings
may be distressing for you. But these findings

16
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:05,190
won't apply just to you. They also are likely
to apply to your blood relations. A study

17
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:12,300
of 285 patients reported in "Genome Medicine"
returned 25 so-called incidental findings,

18
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,120
several of which had profound consequences
for patients and their families.

19
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,270
Let's distinguish among three kinds of costs.
The first two are taken from economics: Opportunity

20
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:32,270
costs and transaction costs. The third kind
of cost is not economic: It's injustice.

21
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,709
Opportunity costs are due to forgoing the
potential benefits of one alternative because

22
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,780
we have taken up another alternative. If you've
chosen to attend a concert but will miss the

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,629
final performance of a stage-play as a result,
missing the stage-play is an opportunity cost.

24
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:52,930
It can be argued that many decisions incur
opportunity costs, especially if those decisions

25
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,640
are irreversible. We'll find out more about
this kind of cost in decision making in another

26
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,640
lecture this week when we investigate indecision.
Trusters may be more vulnerable than contractors,

27
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:11,590
but they enjoy more opportunities. One of
the advantages that trust-based relationships

28
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,590
have over contract-based ones is that trusted
parties are freer to rapidly develop other

29
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,909
relationships. So although contracts have
more inbuilt knowledge and assurance regarding

30
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:31,909
whether obligations will be met and promises
kept, they trade this against opportunity

31
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,030
costs by locking contractors into the relationship
and often forbidding the establishment of

32
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,780
competing relationships.
Transaction costs are the costs of participating

33
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,810
in a market. These include such costs as the
time and effort taken to acquire relevant

34
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:57,810
information, to negotiate or bargain, and
to enforce contractual agreements. Here, I

35
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,239
want to talk about three kinds of transaction
costs: The burden of accountability for what

36
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,239
we know, undesired ignorance generated by
new knowledge, and unwanted changes in one's

37
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,519
relationship, role, or status generated by
new knowledge.

38
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,930
A common transaction cost of newly acquired
knowledge is accountability, responsibility,

39
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:29,930
or even culpability; and thus a moral imperative
to act on it. A bank manager who finds out

40
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,780
that one of his accountants has been embezzling
funds from the bank becomes an accessory to

41
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,340
that crime if he doesn't report it to the
authorities. A medical practitioner whose

42
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,290
diagnosis indicates that her patient has a
treatable disease is bound by oath to either

43
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,200
treat the disease herself or refer the patient
to the appropriate specialist.

44
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,280
When we don't want to be held accountable
for an event or its consequences, we are motivated

45
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,910
to deny that we had prior knowledge. As Daniel
Thiel, in his chapter on "criminal ignorance",

46
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:11,600
points out, appeals to ignorance of outcomes
and denial of intentions are important tools

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,600
used by people and organizations to bend and
evade moral and legal culpability. In organizations

48
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,150
or institutions, such ignorance and denial
can become part of the culture. This seems

49
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,370
to have been the case in numerous Catholic
schools and parishes, according to findings

50
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,480
around the world from investigations into
sexual abuses of students and parishioners

51
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,310
by teachers and priests.
It also is possible for institutions to incline

52
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:48,310
to the opposite extreme, insisting that ignorance
is no excuse. A case in point is the British

53
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:55,660
Medical Journal's decision in 2001 to ban
the word "accident" from its pages. According

54
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,150
to the editorial announcing this edict, most
injuries and the precipitating events are

55
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,150
predictable and preventable, so someone can
be blamed, and the editorial went as far as

56
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,590
to include avalanches and earthquakes in its
scope. This apparently was the view of the

57
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,540
Italian court and judge that convicted six
earthquake experts and a government advisor

58
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,950
responsible for evaluating the threat of natural
disasters in Italy of manslaughter. The court

59
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:30,040
judgment was that they failed to give sufficient
warning about the devastating L'Aquila earthquake

60
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,040
in 2009. The seven defendants were sentenced
to six years' jail.

61
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,780
Another pervasive transaction cost of acquiring
new knowledge arises when it generates new

62
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,280
and unpleasant non-knowledge. The best example
of this is the widely observed fact that the

63
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,550
"knowledge explosion" has also generated a
"risk explosion". Thanks to a combination

64
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,020
of rapidly increasing medical, environmental,
and other scientific knowledge along with

65
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:08,020
mass communication and the net, citizens nowadays
are aware of far more risks than they would

66
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,590
have been 50 years ago. Influential scholars
and commentators have claimed, as Anthony

67
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,400
Giddens did, that "many of the uncertainties
which face us today have been created by the

68
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,400
very growth of human knowledge". Risk theorists
such as Giddens and Ulrich Beck also claim

69
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,560
that these advances, mainly in science and
technology, have generated risks and futures

70
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,410
whose outcomes are global and impossible to
predict.

71
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,470
Where it is foreseeable that new knowledge
could generate undesired uncertainties, questions

72
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:50,960
are raised about whether that knowledge should
be obtained and, if so, who should be granted

73
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,960
access to it. For instance, should the complete
genetic sequencing of the 1918 influenza virus

74
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:05,260
(known as the "Spanish flu") and also its
resurrection have been permitted to go ahead?

75
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,310
This is the virus that killed somewhere between
20 million and 100 million people in 1918

76
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,900
to 1919. What if terrorists acquire the virus?
We will examine debates about this kind of

77
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,920
quandary next week.
Returning to the genetic sequencing example,

78
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,940
the ramified costs of unexpected genetic sequence
findings have ignited heated debate among

79
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:35,700
geneticists, medical practitioners, ethicists,
and laypeople regarding whether participants

80
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,700
in genetic sequencing studies should be given
their results. In cases where the link between

81
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:49,720
a particular gene and a disease risk is not
well-established or contingent on environmental

82
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,759
factors, the argument has been made that it
is irresponsible to burden participants and

83
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,189
their families with that information.
And then there is always the possibility that

84
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:08,579
what is considered to be knowledge about a
risk may turn out to be mistaken. When Alexander

85
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:14,970
Pope wrote that "a little learning is a dangerous
thing", he could not have imagined the ways

86
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:21,970
this would play out when it comes to the mismanagement
of modern risks. Uniroyal manufactured Alar,

87
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,230
a pesticide long used by apple-growers in
the USA. In 1989 the company published a study

88
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:37,339
indicating increased incidence of tumours
in rodents exposed to high levels of UDMH,

89
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:44,230
a compound comprising only 1% of Alar's ingredients.
The National Resources Defense Council extrapolated

90
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:51,189
this finding to claim that 1 in every 4200
children exposed to Alar would develop cancer

91
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:58,189
by age 6. The ensuing publicity and lobbying
so severely damaged business for apple-growers

92
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:05,279
that they begged Uniroyal to withdraw Alar
from the market. It did so within that year.

93
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,839
Two years later, further investigation by
Environmental Protection Agency scientists

94
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:17,839
revised the risk estimate down to 1 in 250,000
children. A 1991 editorial in Science magazine

95
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,149
said "a clearly dubious result about possible
carcinogenicity by a special interest group

96
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:32,149
was hyped by a news organization without the
most simple checks on its reliability or documentation".

97
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:39,470
A third kind of transaction cost of knowledge
is changes in a relationship, status, or role.

98
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:45,379
Even the act of acquiring knowledge can incur
this kind of cost, because some relationships

99
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:50,959
are based partly on agreements about what
kinds of information are off-limits. Suppose

100
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,949
that up to now your boss has given you plenty
of latitude for doing your job. She has let

101
00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:01,589
you carry out your duties in your own way
and is flexible about deadlines. Clearly,

102
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,309
she has trusted you. But now she has announced
that she is going to monitor and evaluate

103
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:12,559
your performance every day. You'll be required
to keep a log of what you do and how you do

104
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,370
it, and information about your use of your
workstation and the internet also will be

105
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:24,139
automatically recorded into a database.
How would you make this feel about your relationship

106
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:31,139
with your boss? You might feel that she no
longer trusts you. Trust-based relationships

107
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:39,139
include an ignorance arrangement. They actually
require that we forego complete first-hand

108
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,699
knowledge about those whom we trust. It is
true that we usually trust only people who

109
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:51,290
we know very well. Nevertheless, the fact
remains that people who trust one another

110
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:56,149
don't monitor one another all the time, nor
do they hold each other constantly accountable

111
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:02,709
for every move they make. The moment they
insist on surveillance, they are acting as

112
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:09,709
though they don't trust one another.
Finally, let's turn to injustice. Examples

113
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:16,889
of injustices are distributive unfairness,
procedural unfairness, and violations of rights.

114
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:23,089
The institutionalization of fairness in competition,
impartiality in criminal trials, and a right

115
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:29,660
to privacy all require agreed-upon ignorance
arrangements that specify the kinds of information

116
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:36,660
that are off-limits and for whom they are
off-limits. Thus, insider trading in investment

117
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,499
markets violates norms for distributive justice,
because the inside traders gain an unfair

118
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:49,499
advantage in knowledge over their competitors.
Norms for procedural fairness and adherence

119
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:55,069
to human rights in the acquisition of knowledge
can be seen in laws that deem court trial

120
00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:02,069
evidence as inadmissible, when it's acquired by
torture, unlawful intrusion, or entrapment.

121
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,759
The case of the American National Security
Agency monitoring phone-calls of innocent

122
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:14,550
citizens or public office-holders in American
allies is widely perceived as a procedural

123
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:21,550
injustice and violating rights to privacy.
In this lecture we've explored several costs

124
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,329
of acquiring knowledge that can tip the balance
in favour of ignorance. These included both

125
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:34,329
opportunity and transaction costs, and injustices.
We have seen that these costs can descend

126
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,069
not only on the knower but also on others.
Newly acquired knowledge, or even the act

127
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:47,069
of acquiring it, can make us suddenly culpable,
reveal hidden uncertainties and risks, alter

128
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:54,009
relationships with other people, or even perpetrate
injustices. By now it should come as no surprise

129
00:13:54,009 --> 00:14:00,829
to you that considerations about secrecy,
privacy, proprietary knowledge, and fairness

130
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:06,069
regarding the acquisition and distribution
of knowledge underpin some of the most far-reaching

131
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:10,040
laws, institutions, and public debates in
the world today.
