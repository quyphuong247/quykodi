In his review of Sarah Palin's book, "Going
Rogue", Jonathan Raban described it as a "four-hundred-page

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,680
paean to virtuous ignorance." What did he
mean by this phrase? Raban was referring to

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,660
the kind of homespun philosophy that is exemplified
by expressions such as "I don't know much

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,410
about art, but I know what I like." He characterized
it as a "commonsense conservatism" whereby

5
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,510
morally upright laypeople are better able
than experts to judge the merits of, say,

6
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,260
American foreign policy, because too much
expertise clouds judgment. Some commentators

7
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,979
opined that "virtuous ignorance" is just another
way of saying "anti-intellectual." But we'll

8
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:05,489
soon see that's an over-simplification. Once
we know what to look for, virtuous ignorance

9
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,770
turns up in lots of places, and not just among
right-wing politicians or, for that matter,

10
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,200
anti-intellectuals.
Here's an example that isn't attributable

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,729
to conservative politicians or anti-intellectuals.
In fact, it involves highly educated people.

12
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:27,409
Back in the 1970's I took a PhD in sociology.
My then fellow sociology graduate students

13
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:33,189
and I hadn't read any psychology beyond a
few works by Freud, but we all knew we hated

14
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:39,310
psychology, with the possible exception of
Freud. More than that, some of us also knew

15
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,030
that psychology was full of reductionist,
positivist, medical-model-following reactionaries

16
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,950
who were blind instruments of capitalism.
Eventually, however, my curiosity was piqued.

17
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,950
What was so evil about psychology? I decided
to find out. When I revealed to my peers and

18
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:06,409
professors that I had started taking a class
in psychology, my status immediately plummeted.

19
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:13,409
For them, not studying psychology indicated
superiority of intellect. True cognoscenti

20
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,540
would know better than to waste their time
learning about such an obviously reprehensible

21
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,760
discipline.
Years later, I ran across anecdotal evidence

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,430
that this view was not confined to students.
A psychologist colleague attended a seminar

23
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:34,780
by a very prominent sociologist, and was inspired
by the sociologist's portrayal of a revolutionary

24
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:41,600
future for the social sciences. However, he
was puzzled that no mention was made of psychology

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,970
or psychologists. Afterward, he approached
the professor and asked him how psychology

26
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:54,620
would fit into his vision of the future. The
sociologist replied that he had once, long

27
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,200
ago, taken a class in psychology but tried
not to think about that unfortunate lapse

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,740
in judgment. These days, I work in a psychology
department. Clearly, I have gone over to the

29
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,410
Dark Side.
I'm not picking on sociologists. Plenty of

30
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,660
examples are available in other disciplines.
Another psychologist colleague, very well

31
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,140
educated and highly intelligent, once confessed
to me that she was proud that she knew nothing

32
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,140
about economics. In these examples, ignorance
is made virtuous by converting it into a kind

33
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,960
of status marker. Professing ignorance of
the right things can be an indicator of high

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,960
status. In many societies, class and/or caste
distinctions have been partly based on this.

35
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,060
Not so long ago in English society, knowledge
of a mere craft or trade (versus an art or

36
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,220
discipline) was considered beneath nobility.
So the issue isn't in the decision or preference

37
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,350
not to know X, it's the moral judgments about
those who do or don't know X. This is the

38
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,180
key to the fascinating realm of virtuous ignorance.
At first, the very phrase may seem almost

39
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,790
oxymoronic. However, it isn't too difficult
to find cases of virtuous ignorance with serious

40
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,680
moral purposes underpinning them.
But first, can people think that ignorance

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,180
is virtuous in other ways than conferring
status on the ignoramus? In his 1991 book,

42
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,220
"Strange Weather", in the Acknowledgements
page, the self-appointed critic of science

43
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,780
Andrew Ross declared "This book is dedicated
to all the science teachers I never had. It

44
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,600
could only have been written without them."
Taken literally, the second sentence seems

45
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,880
unexceptional. I think we would all grant
that had he even a bare-bones scientific education,

46
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,570
Ross could not have written the book that
he did. But some of those rebutting Ross'

47
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:55,240
work, such as biologist Paul Gross and mathematician
Norman Levitt, interpreted his declaration

48
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,250
as a hubristic boast.
Why would Gross and Levitt think this dedication

49
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,160
was a boast, and what could Ross have been
boasting about? A clear hint comes in the

50
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,090
Introduction on page 8, where he says "As
I lacked the training of a scientific intellectual

51
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,970
and the accompanying faith, however vestigial
or self-critical, in the certainties of the

52
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,960
scientific method... My position, then, became
that of a cultural critic". There we have

53
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,220
it: Ross is claiming not only that scientists
are indoctrinated into a faith, but also anyone

54
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,030
undergoing scientific training becomes contaminated
by this faith and, worse still, cannot be

55
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,990
rid of it even through self-criticism. It's
like the stain of Original Sin. Therefore,

56
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,280
contamination can be avoided and purity maintained
only by not studying science.

57
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,780
It isn't a big leap from the idea that knowledge
might be a contaminant to the concept of taboos

58
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,040
against knowledge. We encountered taboos in
my taxonomy of ignorance, under the branch

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:05,040
called "ignoring". Where do knowledge taboos
come from? What creates and sustains them?

60
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,490
The anthropologist Mary Douglas wrote a classic
book "Purity and Danger", with an intriguing

61
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,919
first approximation to a general theory of
taboos. She claimed that there are two kinds

62
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,919
of proscription in taboos: One against threats
or dangers, and another against pollution

63
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,520
or contamination.
So, let's try this out on knowledge. First,

64
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,780
some information could be declared off-limits
because knowing it would pose a danger, either

65
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,200
to oneself or to others, or both. Or perhaps
the process of acquiring the information would

66
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,960
incur dangers. What kinds of dangers lurk
here? Perhaps the most obvious examples are

67
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,990
knowledge that can be used against other people,
such as knowing how to remotely take over

68
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:54,770
people's computers or how to make weapons.
As for acquiring knowledge, the dangers could

69
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:01,440
range from physical (as in experimenting with
explosives) to social (as in committing illegal

70
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,600
acts in the pursuit of knowledge).
Now, consider the second kind of taboo, pollution

71
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,550
or contamination. "Innocence", when it refers
to a kind of saintly naivety, is a familiar

72
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,639
but interesting kind of virtuous ignorance.
In Christian traditions it is associated with

73
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,340
the tree of knowledge, forbidden fruit, and
the events that got humanity kicked out of

74
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:30,180
the Garden of Eden. Those who have lost their
innocence or known sin are "tainted". Mary

75
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,090
Douglas defined pollution as dirt in the wrong
place. Translated into the realm of knowledge

76
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:41,090
and ignorance, the crucial idea is that information
can be in a wrong place. For instance, some

77
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,340
kinds of knowledge, such as how to have sex,
may be considered appropriate for adults but

78
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,370
not for children. One of the most intriguing
aspects of innocence is the notion that its

79
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:57,370
maintenance often requires the protection
of innocents by more knowledgeable (and therefore

80
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:04,250
unclean) guardians.
At first glance, proscriptions against knowledge

81
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:11,250
raise familiar images of censorship, oppression,
and domination: Book burning, bans against

82
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,820
 certain teachings. This sort of thing is fair enough; examples
abound of ignorance imposed by powerful agents

83
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,150
on those who are powerless. Nevertheless,
virtuous ignorance also can be found at the

84
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:30,050
base of benign or even benevolent arrangements
agreed to by society as a whole.

85
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,479
We've already encountered examples of such
arrangements. We've seen that privacy amounts

86
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,930
to a multilateral ignorance arrangement, whereby
we agree that certain kinds of information

87
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:47,769
about ourselves will not be available to others
without our consent. Respecting others' privacy

88
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:54,769
is virtuous behavior, thus, virtuous ignorance.
People who violate privacy norms pose a threat

89
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,839
to the person(s) about whom they have obtained
private information. A right to privacy amounts

90
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,790
to a right to at least some control over who
knows what about you. Virtuous people do not

91
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,699
poke their noses into matters that are none
of their business. In fact, privacy is a close

92
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:19,240
cousin to censorship, especially when censorship
is agreed to by those in power and the public

93
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,730
on whom it is imposed.
We've also seen that social relations based

94
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,730
on trust and friendship operate in a similar
manner. Trust is not about concealing information,

95
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:37,379
but trust relationships do require observance
of an interesting kind of privacy. If one

96
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,509
person is monitoring another or insisting
that they fully account for their actions,

97
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,829
the person under surveillance will conclude
that the monitor does not trust them. Trust,

98
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:51,959
therefore, is both an example of a social
relation that requires tolerance of undesired

99
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,550
uncertainty (the risk of being exploited)
in favor of desired uncertainty (freedom to

100
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,740
seize opportunities for new relations) and,
of course, virtuous behavior.

101
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,300
And so, we have arrived at examples of virtuous
ignorance that are socially mandated and underpin

102
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,300
some important forms of social capital: Privacy,
trust, and friendship. We can add politeness

103
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:23,639
and civility to this list. Moreover, an organizational
culture favoring creativity, initiative, and

104
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:28,920
entrepreneurship requires the toleration of
at least some ignorance.

105
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,129
Finally, let's take a look at an example of
ignorance that is considered virtuous by some

106
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:40,920
but not by others: Ignorance generated by
tax evasion. Tax evasion via the so-called

107
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,980
"shadow economy" is widely tolerated and facilitated
by citizens in many countries, and in those

108
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,720
countries the shadow economy can account for
a large portion of total economic output.

109
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,869
A 2010 International Monetary Fund report
estimated that from 2002 to 2007 in half of

110
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:02,899
the G20 countries, the size of the shadow
economy equated to at least 20% of the official

111
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:08,829
gross domestic product. For many people, tax
evasion is motivated by pragmatic self-interest,

112
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:13,399
but for some it actually represents what they
consider to be a justified protest against

113
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,319
their government's policies on taxation and
related matters.

114
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:22,869
As a result, official economic indicators
such as inflation rates, employment rates,

115
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:28,290
and gross domestic product are substantially
inaccurate. Governing the economy becomes

116
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,249
almost impossible, and the small tax base
severely limits what governments can provide

117
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:40,019
for health, education, welfare, or infrastructure.
But the governments in these countries face

118
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,610
a very awkward tradeoff: They are missing
out on large sources of revenue if they ignore

119
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,480
or tolerate the shadow economy, but cracking
down on the shadow economy could cause the

120
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,029
entire economy to crash.
In this lecture we've investigated the concept

121
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:04,029
of virtuous ignorance, and we've found not
only that it exists, but it's also quite pervasive

122
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,850
and underpins some important forms of taboo
and social relations. Beliefs that certain

123
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,329
kinds of ignorance are morally justified and
that undoing them would be immoral are hard

124
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:21,509
to change, especially if they are embedded
in the dominant culture. The next lecture

125
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:26,249
will focus on a type of ignorance that is
even more difficult to change, namely the

126
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:33,139
kind that accumulates as a byproduct of cognitive
and social processes that are largely unconscious.
