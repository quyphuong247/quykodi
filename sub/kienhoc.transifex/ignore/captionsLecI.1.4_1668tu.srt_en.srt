Now that we've seen what common sense makes
of ignorance, let's find out how to think

2
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,920
more effectively about it. We can start with
the observation that it is actually hard to

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,350
refer directly to ignorance, let alone dealing
with it impartially. We can talk directly

4
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:48,350
about knowing something, but we can't do the
same about not knowing something.

5
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:56,790
We can directly refer to knowing something.
We can say "Alison knows that 2+2 equals 4",

6
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:06,860
and we can say "Alison knows arithmetic".
But if we want to maintain the active voice

7
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,530
and talk about ignorance, then we're forced
to do it by negation:

8
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,530
"Alison doesn't know that 2+2 equals 4", or
"Alison doesn't know arithmetic".

9
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:25,070
Now if we want to refer to ignorance directly,
we have to use the passive-voice:

10
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:32,090
"Alison is ignorant of the fact that 2+2 equals
4", or "Alison is ignorant of arithmetic".

11
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:41,749
If instead we use the active voice: "Alison
ignores that 2+2 equals 4" or "Alison ignores

12
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,899
arithmetic" then we end up meaning something
quite different.

13
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:55,899
The sole exception to this in English, and
many other languages, is the verb "doubt".

14
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:03,639
We can say "Alison doubts that 2+2 equals
4" or even "Alison doubts arithmetic".

15
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,590
But here we're restricted to expressing a
very different specific kind of uncertainty

16
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,959
rather than ignorance, namely an uncertainty
that borders on disbelief.

17
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,959
Compare these sentences with "Alison is uncertain
that 2+2 equals 4" or "Alison is uncertain

18
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:29,599
about arithmetic" or "Alison is uncertain
whether she knows arithmetic".

19
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,599
You should be getting the picture: Talking
about ignorance and its kindred concepts is

20
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,530
tricky. So, what I'm going to do now is introduce
you to a vocabulary and framework that can

21
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,810
enable you to think and talk about ignorance
clearly and effectively.

22
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,950
Let's begin with a workable definition of
ignorance. It's going to have to deal both

23
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,950
with simple lack of knowledge but also incorrect
ideas. We speak of someone as "ignorant" not

24
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,910
only when they simply don't know about something,
but also if what they think they know is wrong.

25
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,670
It will also have to deal with the fact that
someone is attributing ignorance to someone,

26
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,700
be that a different person or to themselves.
So here goes:

27
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,700
"A is ignorant from B's viewpoint if A fails
to agree with or show awareness of ideas which

28
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,080
B defines as actually or potentially valid."
Now this definition covers both lack of knowledge

29
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,990
and wrong ideas. It also handles the attribution
issue. A and B may be different people or

30
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,230
they may be the same. And it leaves open the
question of whether B thinks A should know

31
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,400
something, or should not.
The notion that A and B could be the same

32
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,350
person raises the important question of whether
we are aware of our own ignorance. Philosopher

33
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,240
Ann Kerwin provided an elegant guide to this
issue.

34
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,200
First, she observed that we have knowns and
unknowns.

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,960
We know about some of these, but we don't
know about others.

36
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Then she filled in the table.
The "known knowns" are explicit knowledge.

37
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,740
This is knowledge that we can communicate
or teach to other people, such as how to cook

38
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,740
pasta or change a light-bulb.
The "unknown knowns" are tacit knowledge.

39
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,410
This is knowledge that is difficult or impossible
to communicate or teach to others, such as

40
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:43,410
how to ride a bicycle or hold a conversation.
The "known unknowns" are conscious ignorance

41
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,400
we're aware of. For example, I'm aware that
I don't know how to make my own clothes, or

42
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,100
when and how I will die.
Finally, the "unknown unknowns" are ignorance

43
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,090
we're unaware of, that is, meta-ignorance.
Meta-ignorance is easy to spot in other people,

44
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:10,210
but impossible to see in yourself except retrospectively.
For instance, until I read an article about

45
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,960
quasi-crystals, I didn't know that I didn't know
about them. Or when I was about nine years

46
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,750
old I thought I knew that "trucelent" was
pronounced "trooselent", until my mother informed

47
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,750
me that it's "trukulent".
Now let's turn to the matter of vocabulary.

48
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,160
There are numerous terms we use in natural
language for unknowns. Properly used, they

49
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,970
can help organize our thinking about ignorance.
In my taxonomy, I divided the terms for unknowns

50
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:47,570
into two groups. First, we have "error", which
includes all of the passive-voice terms referring

51
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,139
either to the absence of knowledge or incorrect
beliefs.

52
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:57,050
Second, we have "irrelevance", which includes
all of the terms that refer to ignoring things.

53
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,400
This is the active-voice side of ignorance,
and refers to things we don't need to know

54
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,400
or things we shouldn't know.
Under "error" we have "distortion" and "incompleteness".

55
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:15,850
"Distortion" includes erroneous or false beliefs,
and "incompleteness" includes absence of knowledge

56
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,250
and uncertain knowledge.
Under "irrelevance" we have three categories:

57
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:28,250
"untopicality", "taboo", and "undecidability".
"Untopicality" refers to things we feel we

58
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,419
don't need to know. For example, most of us,
most of the time, don't need to know the distance

59
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,639
from the Earth to the sun.
"Taboo" refers to matters that are forbidden

60
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,260
to us. Classified military information is
an example where the taboo is enforced by

61
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,850
a powerful authority. Taboos also can be enforced
via cultural and social norms, such as privacy.

62
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,440
In many workplaces, for instance, it usually
would be viewed as inappropriate for a superior

63
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,440
to interrogate a subordinate about her or
his sexual behavior outside of the workplace.

64
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,699
"Undecidability" denotes matters that, in
principle, cannot be determined to be true

65
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:12,490
or false. The classical liar's paradox is
an example. Suppose I declare that what I

66
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:19,490
am saying now is a lie. If you decide I'm
telling the truth then I'm lying. But if I'm

67
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:26,669
lying, then of course I've told the truth.
Turning now to "distortion", we have two kinds.

68
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,960
"Confusion" is mistaking something for something
else. If I try to write on paper with my tablet's

69
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,120
stylus, then I have confused my stylus with
a pen.

70
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,070
"Inaccuracy" amounts to miss-estimating something.
I believe I have $50 in my wallet, but it

71
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,080
turns out that I have only $20, so I've miss-estimated
the amount of money I'm carrying.

72
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Finally, under "incompleteness" we have "uncertainty"
and "absence". "Absence" is exactly what it

73
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:05,540
sounds like: Missing information. "Uncertainty",
on the other hand, has three varieties: "Probability",

74
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,150
"ambiguity", and "vagueness".
"Probability" is uncertainty about whether

75
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:18,650
something is true or whether an event will
happen. A juror may think that the defendant

76
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:24,340
probably is guilty, but still not be sure.
I may think that it probably won't rain tomorrow,

77
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,150
but I'm not certain.
"Vagueness" and "ambiguity" are related terms

78
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,370
that oftentimes are used interchangeably.
But I prefer to keep them separate. Ambiguity

79
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:41,370
refers to distinct possible states. So, if
my friend says "this food is hot" and doesn't

80
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:49,389
say anything more than that, he could mean
high temperature or that it's spicy hot. Vagueness,

81
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,690
on the other hand, refers to some kind of
interval on some sort of quantitative dimension.

82
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,100
So if my friend says If he says that he's
had several appointments today, he could mean

83
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:08,100
anything from somewhere around 3 to somewhere
around 10. So he's being vague in that sense.

84
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,710
The sociologist Matthias Gross integrated
some of my concepts and those from other scholars

85
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,710
of ignorance into his "house of the unknown".
Like me, he uses "ignorance" as a cover term

86
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,540
for not knowing, but he also assumes that
this is conscious ignorance: the unknowns

87
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,390
that we're aware of.
"Nonknowledge" is ignorance that is sufficiently

88
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,630
specified that, at least in principle, we
could eradicate it or overcome it. For instance,

89
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,350
if I have a question but I also know how to
find out about it, then in principle I can

90
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,020
answer it.
"Negative knowledge", on the other hand, is

91
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:56,250
Karin Knorr-Cetina's term for knowledge about
what we cannot know or don't want to know.

92
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,410
So, I can never know what my father would
have thought about my choice of career because

93
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:07,410
he died when I was only 11 years old.
Thus, ignorance can become either knowledge,

94
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,140
or nonknowledge or negative knowledge, which
is a way of saying that ignorance may be reducible

95
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:19,940
or irreducible.
Dr. Gross places another term, "nescience",

96
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,050
outside the house of the unknown. This term
is similar to my concept of meta-ignorance

97
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,540
or Ann Kerwin's unknown unknowns. Once we
become aware of our nescience, it can become

98
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:38,540
ignorance or even go straight to nonknowledge.
Nonknowledge, or reducible ignorance, sometimes

99
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,820
can therefore be converted into new knowledge
or at least an extension of older knowledge.

100
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:53,120
But new knowledge also can generate new problems
or questions, that is, more ignorance. Neuroscientist

101
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,800
Stuart Firestein likes to say that the main
business of scientific research is creating

102
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,880
better ignorance.
And so nonknowledge also is capable of generating

103
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,880
further nonknowledge or even more nescience.
So now we have some concepts and terms for

104
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:21,779
talking about various kinds of unknowns. We
also have a working definition of ignorance

105
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:27,550
that takes into account the fact that we can't
refer to it without taking a point of view.

106
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,690
That's very important because ignorance is
largely socially constructed. All these terms

107
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,430
and concepts are culturally embedded and they
have a history.

108
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:45,430
Well, how is all this going to help you?
First, we're going to be using these concepts

109
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,779
and terms throughout the course, so becoming
familiar with them is going to be essential

110
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,500
if you're going to understand a lot of what's
to come.

111
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,290
But second, these concepts and terms are based
on what people actually think and do when

112
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,110
it comes to ignorance. People think and act
as though there are different kinds of ignorance,

113
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,709
and as if each kind has its own characteristics
and its own uses.

114
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:12,680
In the next two lectures, we're going to deepen
our understanding of some of the terms we've

115
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,459
introduced in this lecture. In the one to
follow this, we'll be investigating the concept

116
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:26,459
of ignoring, as opposed to being ignorant
of. And in the lecture after that, we'll explore

117
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:33,820
the concept of negative knowledge: the limits
of what we can know. I'll see you next time.
