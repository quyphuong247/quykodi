In Week 4, Mike's presentations covered the
evidence for different types of ignorance,

2
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,320
specifically: looking at why it matters that
people distinguish among different kinds of

3
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,220
ignorance; secondly, examining different kinds
of ambiguity; third, comparing conflict and

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,390
ambiguity; fourth, highlighting state specific*
ignorance, in other words when we don't know

5
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,420
what to expect or what all the options are;
fifth, linking different kinds of ignorance

6
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,250
with different networks in the brain; and
sixth, examining how the meanings and roles

7
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,570
of ignorance have evolved over time.

8
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,210
The first thing to say is that it will have
been evident from Mike's lectures that this

9
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:10,600
line of investigation is still in its infancy.
Both understanding different kinds of ignorance

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,439
and what this means practically, especially
for dealing with complex problems, is a fertile

11
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,430
area for on-going work. As Mike pointed out,
better understanding in this area will involve,

12
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,920
first, appreciation of the uses and roles,
including distinct psychological functions,

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,749
for different kinds of ignorance. Second,
understanding how people respond to different

14
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:40,560
kinds of ignorance and how that will enhance
the different enhance understanding of human

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,270
thought and behaviour. One aspect that's particularly
important here is that language is the primary

16
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,799
medium in which people think, so unravelling
different terms for ignorance and how they

17
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,530
are used is important. Third and finally,
the ability to differentiate among effective

18
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,939
ways to deal with or "unmake" various kinds
of ignorance is an important feature of better

19
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,289
understanding different kinds of ignorance.

20
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:13,720
Mike concentrated on four kinds of ignorance:
probability, ambiguity, conflict, and state

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,450
space ignorance. You will recall from his
taxonomy presented in Week 1 that there are

22
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,510
many other types of ignorance, so there is
plenty to do in investigating whether and

23
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,510
how we distinguish these. But even just concentrating
on the four types discussed this week provides

24
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,120
rich veins for exploration.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,030
In terms of what this ability to distinguish
between different kinds of ignorance means

26
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,560
for dealing with complex problems, what I
am going to focus on here is mapping out areas

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,260
for investigation.

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,990
There are at least three productive ways forward.
One is looking at cases through this ignorance

29
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:01,280
lens. By cases I mean real-world efforts to
deal with complex problems, like the ones

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,600
I pointed to in my week 1 lecture. The issue
here is to find investigations that examined

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,340
such problems and analyse how they dealt with
different kinds of ignorance or unknowns.

32
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,840
Further, what worked and what did not? My
hunch is that a lot of the time the information

33
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,190
relevant to ignorance will not be adequately
documented, so developing protocols for adequate

34
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,260
descriptions of ignorance will be another
important task. That's certainly been my experience

35
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,360
in the work I've done so far.

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,380
A second area for investigation of the importance
of different kinds of ignorance and complex

37
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,520
problems is to conduct natural experiments.
Those who are currently working on complex

38
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,820
problems can experiment with different ways
of releasing information about uncertainties,

39
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,240
for example, or different ways of countering
mis-information and seeing what works best.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,350
Natural experiments are most useful when they
are linked with the kind of theory and controlled

41
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,530
experiments that Mike described in his lectures.

42
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,540
Another way of doing natural experiments is
for someone who is not involved to review

43
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,650
a number of on-going investigations and to
compare them on how they deal with ignorance

44
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,039
and what works and what does not. For example,
what... one might review the work of the Intergovernmental

45
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:26,569
Panel on Climate Change, and other large projects
on environmental, health, educational and

46
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,660
security issues to undertake such a project.

47
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:37,069
Both of these ways of understanding more about
different kinds of ignorance and how they

48
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:43,240
impact on our ability to deal with complex
problems, require a substantial amount of

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,990
funding and effort.

50
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,690
Another way forward, where smaller scale efforts
will work, is to examine ways that have already

51
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:59,690
been developed to deal with ignorance, and
analysing on how well and how... and how they

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,120
distinguish between different kinds of ignorance.
This is the third and final approach that

53
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,000
I will describe and I will spend a little
more time on this one.

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,190
Let's start with vagueness as a way of dealing
with ignorance. Mike presented evidence that

55
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:21,620
ambiguity is preferred to conflict, predicting
that vagueness would often be a valuable tool

56
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,720
in group decision making. I can certainly
attest to that from my own experience in working

57
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,840
with groups on complex problems. There will
always be some members of a group who want

58
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,370
to pin down exact definitions and ways of
proceeding, but doing this will often just

59
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,210
open up increasing differences among group
members. Reaching agreement usually involves

60
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:52,210
a degree of non-specificity and latitude for
interpretation --- in other words, vagueness.

61
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,800
What we don't know is how widely this tactic
is used and if there are times when it backfires.

62
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,940
We all know, for example, that the "devil
is often in the detail". In my experience,

63
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,400
though, the detail often becomes less important
as the project progresses and the vagueness

64
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,110
smooths a path to productive working together.
But the evidence we have is largely anecdotal

65
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,580
and a more systematic approach would be helpful.

66
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,360
The second approach to dealing with a particular
kind of ignorance that I want to describe

67
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,949
is the Ignorance or Gapminder project, which
has been specifically developed to overcome

68
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:36,210
incorrect ideas about global health that are
held by the majority of the community and

69
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:43,210
the media. For example, few people know that
in the last 20 years the percentage of people

70
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,360
living in extreme poverty has almost halved.
Most think it's stayed the same or doubled.

71
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,740
The originators of this project have determined
four rules of thumb to more accurately guide

72
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,210
our thinking about such problems: first, that
most things are improving; second, that most

73
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:08,900
people are in the middle; third, that social
improvements precede increased wealth; and

74
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,970
fourth, that fears are usually exaggerated.

75
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,550
Useful questions to ask about this project
and the ways of proceeding are the following.

76
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,580
First, how widely applicable are these four
rules of thumb? Second, how effective are

77
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,690
they in attracting attention? (You'll recall
from last week's lectures that it's attention,

78
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:35,050
not facts or knowledge, that's in short supply.)
Third, what's helping or hindering these rules

79
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,020
of thumb from having an impact on overcoming
incorrect ideas in the public and media?

80
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,570
Third and finally I want to draw attention
to an elicitation process for limiting the

81
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:53,010
impact of biases in expert judgement. Biases
are the cognitive illusions that Mike mentioned

82
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:59,780
- over-confidence, confirmation bias, and
hindsight bias. This week he also added the

83
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,800
"catch-all underestimation bias". A colleague,
Mark Burgman, and his group have developed

84
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,389
a way for groups to decompose and revise questions
and then combine individual and group judgements

85
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:16,919
to limit the impact of a number of biases.
Again teasing apart how well this works and

86
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,800
how effectively it is taken up will move us
forward.

87
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,960
What we can see from this week's lectures
is that there's an increasingly strong scientific

88
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,960
basis for differentiating among kinds of ignorance.
In applying this to real world complex problems,

89
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,990
it is also clear that there's much to be done
in gathering what we know, re-analysing past

90
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:44,250
work and conducting new work. I look forward
to hearing your experiences and thoughts through

91
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,139
the discussion forum.
