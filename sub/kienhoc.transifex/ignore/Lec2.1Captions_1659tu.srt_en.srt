There are things we'd rather not know. Some
of these are temporary; we'd like to know

2
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,210
them eventually but not just now. Others are
things we never want to know.

3
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,610
In this lecture I'll focus on the temporary
kind and in the next lecture I'll examine

4
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,070
things we never want to know. Temporary ignorance
has many uses, some of which are not immediately

5
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,070
obvious. I'll present three examples of such
uses: Entertainment, learning or discovery,

6
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,180
and a sense of freedom. Let's begin with entertainment.
Many forms of entertainment require temporary

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:03,180
audience ignorance, including almost all forms
of story-telling and jokes. No unknowns? No

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,000
mysteries? No surprises? Then no entertainment.
To see how this works, we'll start with humor

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,940
and story-telling and then go on to games.
The Incongruity Theory of humorous entertainment

10
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,390
says that some kinds of humor rely on setting
up an expectation for the audience and then

11
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,610
violating it. The idea that the unexpected
can be a source of humor goes at least as

12
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:33,010
far back as Cicero. The first time the banana
peel gag appeared on the big screen was in

13
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,610
the Charlie Chaplin movie "By the Sea". As
his character The Tramp, he tosses a banana

14
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,270
peel on the ground without paying attention,
only to slip on it later. Chaplin is credited

15
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,590
with a comedic advance on this gag: A fellow
is shown walking towards the peel, and when

16
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,150
his foot is about to hit the peel he deftly
steps over it, only to fall down an open manhole.

17
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:02,150
Many kinds of riddles, jokes, and puns trade
on ambiguity, both lexical and syntactic.

18
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,200
Newspaper headlines sometimes display this
kind of ambiguity, whether intentionally or

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,379
not:
"Red Tape Holds up Bridge",

20
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:17,730
"Twenty-Year Friendship Ends at Altar",
"Actor Jailed for Not Finishing Sentence".

21
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,060
Syntactic ambiguity is where parts of speech
are ambiguous. Again, we can find plenty of

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,819
examples from news headlines:
"New Housing for Elderly Not Yet Dead",

23
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:35,069
"County Officials to Talk Rubbish",
"British Left Waffles on Falkland Islands".

24
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,219
To be effective, even non-humorous stories
have to put us in at least a temporary state

25
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:45,829
of ignorance. We don't immediately know who
the crime-novel murderer is; we're not sure

26
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:50,999
whether or how the love-interest characters
in a movie are going to get together; we don't

27
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:55,739
yet realize that the benevolent uncle in the
stage-play really is a psychopath; and so

28
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,019
on. If we're late to come to a book or movie
and are looking it up on the net, we find

29
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,049
warnings of "plot spoilers" that we'd best
avoid in order to retain its entertainment

30
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:10,519
value.
Games are an example of entertainment where

31
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,349
ignorance has a key role, even in games of
skill. A game that is a foregone conclusion

32
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:22,980
is not very entertaining. Games of skill are
like tests but more fun. Why? Partly because

33
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,669
games have more uncertainty built into them
than tests do, and so they tease us with a

34
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:34,299
mix of outcomes due to skill and sheer luck.
More than 25 years ago, a clinical neuropsychologist

35
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,249
working in a large hospital told me how he
ended up exploiting this connection between

36
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:44,139
games and tests. One of his chief duties was
to assess the state and recovery of cognitive

37
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:51,139
functions of patients in a head trauma unit,
often victims of automobile accidents or strokes.

38
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,659
The well-established tests of memory, motor
control and sustained attention had good psychometric

39
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:03,379
properties but they were boring. Some patients
refused to take them; others complied but

40
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:08,959
only with a desultory effort.
Then inspiration struck: My colleague noticed

41
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,430
that anyone who could manage it would head
down the ward corridor to play Space Invaders.

42
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,780
Here was a ready-made test of attention and
motor control built into a game. Moreover,

43
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,710
repeatedly playing the game actually would
facilitate patients' recovery, so unlike the

44
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:33,180
standard cognitive tests this "test" had a
therapeutic effect. He attached a computer

45
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,310
to the back of the game, established benchmark
measures such as how long players would last

46
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,100
if they did nothing or moved the joystick
randomly, and started recording individual

47
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,500
patients' results. The results were a clinician's
dream: Meaningful data tracking patients'

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:58,500
recovery plus a therapeutic exercise.
Now let's turn to learning and discovery.

49
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,850
If we are to learn or discover anything intentionally,
then we have to begin with a known unknown.

50
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,950
Any research project begins this way, as do
other creative undertakings. In their Routledge

51
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:16,040
International Handbook of Ignorance chapter,
Katja Vogt and Jens Haas distinguished between

52
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,700
ignorance that motivates inquiry and that
which does not. They deemed the first kind

53
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,590
preferable in general. They're not alone.
In fact, in a 1993 paper I said that ignorance

54
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,410
is THE motivator for inquiry. If we already
know, why inquire at all?

55
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,840
The most productive known unknowns have three
properties. First, they must be motivating:

56
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,720
We have to want to resolve them. Second, they
must contain enough information to be resolvable.

57
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,430
This is what sociologist Robert Merton meant
when he wrote that scientific work is made

58
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,270
possible by "specified ignorance". Third,
resolving the known unknown should generate

59
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,740
additional motivating and resolvable unknowns.
This may have been what poet e.e. cummings

60
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,380
had in mind when he declared "always the beautiful
answer who asks a more beautiful question".

61
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,890
It certainly is what lies behind the standard
conclusion to a scientific paper stating that

62
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:21,010
more research is needed.
In this vein, Stuart Firestein's book is all

63
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,600
about how ignorance drives scientific work.
In fact, Merton, Firestein, Haas and Vogt,

64
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,630
and I all are on the same page. We observe
that ignorance plus inquiry not only can yield

65
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:38,170
knowledge, it can improve our ignorance. Not
knowing that the Earth is not a perfect sphere

66
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,190
is better than not knowing that it's round
at all.

67
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,330
The idea that ignorance drives inquiry suggests
that there's an emotional component involved.

68
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:54,330
We don't just think we're curious or interested;
we feel curious or interested. Curiosity and

69
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,150
interest have an emotional cutting-edge. Intellectuals,
artists and researchers have a mixed-motive

70
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,020
relationship with their own ignorance. On
the one hand, they are in the business of

71
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:11,960
vanquishing ignorance and resolving uncertainties.
On the other, they need an endless supply

72
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,110
of the unknowns, riddles, problems and even
paradoxes that are the oxygen of the creative

73
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,970
mind.
Artists are not attracted to obvious ideas,

74
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,870
nor scientists to easy problems. They want
their unknowns to be knowable and problems

75
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,250
to be solvable, but also interesting and challenging.
This is what the physicist Piet Hein was getting

76
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,680
at with his aphorism, "Problems worthy of
attack prove their worth by fighting back."

77
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,930
Indeed, sometimes creative folk actually miss
their unknowns and puzzles once they've been

78
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,930
dispatched. Andrew Wiles, the mathematician
who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, spoke openly

79
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,460
of his sense of loss for the problem that
had possessed him for more than 7 years.

80
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,120
Finally, let's consider freedom. I mentioned
in the lecture on metaphors that freedom is

81
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:11,010
a positive label for the unknown. If you have
no unknowns in your future, you have no options

82
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,350
and therefore no freedom. People are willing
to take risks and make sacrifices for their

83
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,800
freedom, and here I am not referring only
to a choice between freedom and a dreadful

84
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,560
confinement or tyrannical oppression. Instead,
I have in mind tradeoffs between freedom and

85
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,560
desirable, even optimal but locked-in outcomes.
People may cling to their freedom to choose

86
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:42,579
even if it means refusing excellent choices.
A 2004 paper by Jiwoong Shin and Daniel Ariely,

87
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:48,240
described in Ariely's entertaining book "Predictably
Irrational", reports the results of experimental

88
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,060
evidence for this claim. Shin and Ariely set
up an online game with 3 clickable doors,

89
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,420
each of which yielded a range of payoffs (e.g.
between 1 and 10 cents). The object of the

90
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,150
game was to make as much money as possible
in 100 clicks. There was a twist: Every time

91
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,260
one door was clicked, the others would shrink
by a certain amount, and if unchosen for sufficiently

92
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:16,750
many times a door would disappear altogether.
Shin and Ariely found that even bright university

93
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:23,750
(MIT) students would forgo top earnings in
order to keep all the doors open. For them,

94
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,330
the opportunity costs of closed doors loomed
larger than the payoffs they could have had

95
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,860
by sticking with the best door.
Remember the Honey Bee Game? Did you try to

96
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,870
keep the flowers from disappearing? If achieving
certainty is framed in terms of closing off

97
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:46,240
options, we sometimes strive to keep them
open, even if that means missing out on the

98
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,640
best choice.
What could drive us to keep our options open,

99
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,100
refusing to commit even when we end up with
a poorer choice? Many of us think that the

100
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,900
more options we keep open, the more winning
tickets we may hold and the greater the chance

101
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,900
we might get lucky. This heuristic is surprisingly
powerful, and its power is illustrated in

102
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:15,410
a startling effect reported by Kirkpatrick
and Epstein in 1992. They offered people a

103
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,300
choice between drawing a ticket from a lottery
of 10 tickets, 9 losing and 1 winning, and

104
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,200
a lottery with 100 tickets, 90 losing and
10 winning. The participants all confirmed

105
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,510
that they knew the probability of winning
either lottery was .1, so there was no effect

106
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,839
on their probability judgments. Nevertheless,
when asked which they preferred, most chose

107
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,250
the 100-ticket lottery. Why? Because that
lottery gave them 10 winning options whereas

108
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,560
the other gave them only 1.
This lecture has presented examples of temporary

109
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,370
unknowns and the uses they have. By now it
should be apparent that useful temporary ignorance

110
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:04,279
underpins the realms of entertainment, games,
learning, discovering, and creating. These

111
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:11,020
realms aren't just ignorance-tolerant: Without
ignorance they don't exist. I can't express

112
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,350
this any better than a saying attributed to
Gotama Buddha, that enlightenment exists solely

113
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:22,720
because of delusion and ignorance; if they
disappear, so will enlightenment.
