In this, the final week of our course, we're
going to investigate when ignorance can be

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,840
good or bad for us. We already have a few
clues. Resolvable or reducible unknowns form

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,739
the basis for entertainment, discovery, creativity,
and a sense of personal freedom. There are

4
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,070
things we may never want to know because they
are irrelevant, distressing, or taboo. But

5
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,500
when are there disadvantages for knowing more
or advantages for knowing less? We'll see

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,600
when the pursuit of more information or greater
certainty is futile, how some kinds of ignorance

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,600
actually earn their keep, the conditions under
which an ignoramus can outperform a know-it-all,

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,010
and that "fallacious" heuristics such as Gambler's
Fallacy can be adaptive.

9
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,790
But first, let's find out when more information
makes us worse decision makers.

10
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,940
A very widely held belief is that the more
information and knowledge we have, the better

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,869
predictions and decisions we'll make. Indeed,
most of us have been rewarded throughout our

12
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:29,079
lives for knowing things, for being informed.
Possessing more information understandably

13
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:36,079
makes us more confident about our decisions
and predictions. We've already seen experimental

14
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,090
evidence that we dislike having to make decisions
in situations where we lack information.

15
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:50,149
Nevertheless, our intuitions about the disadvantages
of ignorance can lead us astray in important

16
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:57,149
ways. Not all information is worth having,
and there are situations where more is worse.

17
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,890
I'm not going to bother with the obvious cases,
such as information that paralyses us emotionally,

18
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,910
disinformation, or sheer information overload.
Instead, I'd like to stay with situations

19
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:15,100
where there isn't excessive information, we're
quite capable of processing it and acting

20
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:22,020
on it, and its content is valid. Those are
the conditions that can trip us up in sneaky

21
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,780
ways.
An intriguing 2007 paper by Crystal Hall,

22
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,630
Lynn Ariss and Alexander Todorov presented
an experiment in which half their participants

23
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:37,440
were given statistical information (halftime
score and win-lose records) about opposing

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,220
basketball teams in American NBA games and
asked to predict the game outcomes. The other

25
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:50,220
half were given the same statistical information
plus the team members' names. Basketball fans'

26
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,540
confidence in their predictions was higher
when they had this additional knowledge. However,

27
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,540
knowing the team members' names also caused
them to under-value the statistical information,

28
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,930
resulting in less accurate predictions.
So, even additional irrelevant information

29
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,530
makes us more confident about our predictions,
and worse still, additional irrelevant information

30
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,660
can distract us from relevant information.
We seem to have an inbuilt intuition that

31
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,790
we should be taking all our information into
account when making predictions, even if some

32
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,150
of that information is useless.
Similarly, it seems plausible that experts

33
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,200
make better decisions than novices in their
domain of expertise because their expertise

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,780
enables them to take more information into
account. However, closer examination of this

35
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,950
intuition via studies comparing expert and
novice decision making reveals a counterintuitive

36
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,840
tendency for experts to actually use less
information than novices, especially under

37
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,000
time pressure or when there is a large amount
of information to sift through. Mary Omodei

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and her colleagues studied professionals'
decision making and their 2005 paper concluded

39
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,400
that experts know which information is important
and which can be ignored, whereas novices

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,509
try to take it all on board and get misled
as a result.

41
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:24,720
Nevertheless, even experts can be misled by
irrelevant information. Stephan Lewandowsky

42
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,440
and his colleagues found evidence for this
in their studies of expert bushfire fighters.

43
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,930
They investigated how seasoned wildfire commanders
predicted the spread of simulated wildfires.

44
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,930
There are two primary relevant variables:
Wind velocity and the slope of the terrain.

45
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,630
In general, fires tend to spread uphill and
with the wind. Given a downhill wind, a sufficiently

46
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,870
strong wind pushes the fire downhill with
it, otherwise the fire spreads uphill against

47
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,310
the wind.
But it turned out that the experts' predictions

48
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:06,310
depended on an additional piece of information.
If it was a wildfire to be brought under control,

49
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,780
experts expected it to spread downhill with
the wind. If an identical fire was presented

50
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,720
as a back burn (that is, lit by the fire-fighters
themselves) experts predicted the reverse,

51
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,710
that the fire would spread uphill against
the wind. Of course, this is ridiculous: The

52
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,110
fire doesn't know who lit it. Lewandowsky's
group reproduced this phenomenon in the lab

53
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,350
and named it "knowledge partitioning", whereby
people learn two opposing conclusions from

54
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:42,350
the same data, each triggered by an irrelevant
contextual cue that they mistake for additional

55
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,760
relevant knowledge.
Still, doesn't knowing more increase the chances

56
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,430
you'll make the right choices? Many years
ago Peter Ayton, an English professor visiting

57
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,120
a Turkish university, had the distinctly odd
idea of getting Turkish students to predict

58
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,840
32 English FA cup third-round match winners.
The Turkish students knew very little about

59
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,260
English soccer, so he expected them to do
no better than chance (50%) at predicting

60
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:18,260
winners. To his surprise, not only did the
Turkish students do better than chance (63%),

61
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
they did about as well as a much better-informed
sample of English students (66%).

62
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,530
How did the Turkish students manage it? They
were using what has come to be called the

63
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,639
"recognition heuristic": If they recognized
one team name or its city of origin but not

64
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,350
the other, in 95% of the cases they predicted
the recognized team would win. If they recognized

65
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,600
both teams, some of them applied what they
knew about the teams to decide between them.

66
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,970
Otherwise, they guessed.
How could the recognition heuristic do better

67
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:58,280
than chance? The teams or cities that the
Turkish students recognized were more likely

68
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,100
than the other teams to appear in sports news
because they were the more successful teams.

69
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,300
So the more successful the team, the more
likely it would be one of those recognized

70
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,510
by the Turkish students. In other words, the
recognition cue was strongly correlated with

71
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,430
the FA match outcome.
Many of the more knowledgeable English students,

72
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,430
on the other hand, recognized all of the teams.
They couldn't use a recognition cue but instead

73
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:34,990
had to rely on knowledge cues, things they
knew about the teams. How could the recognition

74
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,320
cue do as well as the knowledge-based cues?
A possible explanation is that the recognition

75
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,090
cue was more strongly correlated with the
FA match outcomes than the knowledge cues

76
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,620
were.
In two classic papers published in 1999 and

77
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,320
2002, Dan Goldstein and Gerd Gigerenzer presented
several empirical demonstrations like Ayton's.

78
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,169
In fact, they demonstrated that not only is
it possible for less knowledgeable people

79
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:08,990
to do as well as their more knowledgeable
counterparts in decisions such as these, they

80
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:15,260
may even do better. The phenomenon of more
ignorant people outperforming more knowledgeable

81
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:22,260
ones in making correct decisions became known
as the "less-is-more" effect.

82
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:29,590
For those of us who believe that more information
is required for better decisions, the less-is-more

83
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,669
effect is disturbing. Understandably, it has
generated a cottage-industry of research and

84
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:42,669
debate, mainly devoted to two questions: To
what extent does it occur and under what conditions

85
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,480
can it occur?
In August 2009 I was visiting Oxford to work

86
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,579
with two colleagues there, and through their
generosity I was housed at Corpus Christi

87
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:58,209
College. During the quiet nights in my room
I tunneled my way toward understanding how

88
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:05,209
the less-is-more effect works. In a nutshell,
here's the main part of what I found and reported

89
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:11,550
in a paper that came out in 2010.
We'll compare an ignoramus (someone who recognizes

90
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,980
only some of the teams) with a know-it-all
who recognizes all of them. Let's assume both

91
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,100
are using the same knowledge cues about the
teams they recognize in common. There are

92
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,449
three kinds of comparison pairs: Both teams
are recognized by the ignoramus, neither of

93
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:35,019
them is recognized, and only one of them is
recognized.

94
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,730
In the first kind the ignoramus and know-it-all
may perform equally well because they're using

95
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,730
the same knowledge cues. In the second kind
the ignoramus flips a coin whereas the know-it-all

96
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,069
still uses the knowledge cues. Assuming that
the knowledge-cue accuracy for these pairs

97
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:57,290
is higher than coin-flipping, the know-it-all
will outperform the ignoramus in comparisons

98
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:04,290
between unrecognized teams. So far, the know-it-all
is winning.

99
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,199
But in the third kind, the ignoramus uses
the recognition cue whereas the know-it-all

100
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:16,089
uses the knowledge cues. This is where the
recognition cue may beat the knowledge cues,

101
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,470
but it has to do so by a margin sufficient
to make up for the coin-flip-vs-knowledge

102
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,850
cue deficit in order for there to be a less-is-more
effect.

103
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:33,009
Can this happen in real life? Yes: Less-is-more
effects have been observed in real-world settings

104
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:39,160
such as predicting sports event outcomes,
and choosing which of two cities is more populous.

105
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Mind you, the conditions where an ignoramus
outperforms a know-it-all don't arise so often

106
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,679
as to justify mass insurrection among students
or abject surrender by their teachers. Knowing

107
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:59,360
more still is the best bet. Nevertheless,
we have here some sobering lessons for those

108
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,360
of us who think that more information or knowledge
is an unalloyed good. It isn't always so,

109
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,139
especially if it is irrelevant to what we're
trying to predict.
