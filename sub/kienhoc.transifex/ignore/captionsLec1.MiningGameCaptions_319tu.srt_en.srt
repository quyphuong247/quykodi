The games in this course are designed to enable
you to experience specific kinds of unknowns

2
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,300
in environments where you can have some fun
and also learn about how to make choices in

3
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,300
situations where you don't have full information.
In the Gem Mining game you're down in a  mine

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,400
drilling for gems. You can choose between
two sites in which to drill, where gems clearly

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,900
are visible through the rock-face. However,
these sites may not be equally likely to yield

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,100
gems.
Let's take a look at the game itself, and

7
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
I'll give you a couple of tips about how to
play it.

8
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,100
Here we are, down in the mine.
You orient the drill with your mouse. It points

9
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,200
toward your cursor.
You move the drill with the four arrow keys

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,200
on your keyboard. They give you eight directions
in which to move the drill.

11
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,600
When you place the drill's tip over a gem,
you get it to drill by left-clicking your

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,900
mouse. Like this.
You'll see a shower of sparks and you'll hear

13
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,300
a drilling noise.
You'll also see the scoreboard recording the

14
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:46,300
number of drilling attempts at the site you've
chosen, and the number of hits of gems 

15
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:53,850
that you've scored, in dollar amounts. You can see I've
scored five hits of Rubies out of twelve attempts.

16
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,900
You can choose to drill in two sites.
One of them, the Opal site, produces Opals

17
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,900
or nothing. But the Ruby site produces either
Rubies, or Quartz, or nothing.

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Quartz doesn't have value, so although you
can see the number of times drilling yields

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,100
quartz, it doesn't add anything to your total
score. Only Opals and Rubies count towards

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,700
your score.
The game ends after you've made 300 drilling

21
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,200
attempts.
Well, that's all there is to the Gem Mining

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,000
game. It's really very simple. See if you
can figure out the best way to play this game.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,500
Good luck.
