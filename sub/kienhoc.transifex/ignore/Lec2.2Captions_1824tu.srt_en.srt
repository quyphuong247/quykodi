The previous lecture concentrated on why many
of us want to have at least some temporary

2
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,010
unknowns in our lives. What about things we
never need or want to know?

3
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,370
The things never to know about fall into four
categories. First, there are things we choose

4
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,239
not to know because we think they're irrelevant
or unimportant. Second are the things we choose

5
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,239
not to know because we think we would be better
off not knowing. Third are the things we subconsciously

6
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:57,619
don't want to know. And fourth, things we
choose to know but would be better off not

7
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,259
knowing.
We can and do make choices about which information

8
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:07,930
we ignore or don't bother learning. For an
example, look no further than your own choices

9
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,780
regarding email filters, search engines, web-feeds,
and the like. These instruments reflect what

10
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,280
you choose to ignore or filter out. Some of
these choices are perfectly rational: We know

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,280
enough about the information in advance to
know that it's not worth the effort to find

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,330
out about it. But this isn't always the case.
We may think that a political or health issue

13
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:37,610
is irrelevant to us, only to belatedly realize
that it's relevant, often when it's too late.

14
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:43,490
As we saw in the lecture "We Know Less than
We Think We Do", we have to make these choices

15
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:49,190
because our cognitive capacities are limited.
Thanks to the knowledge explosion and technological

16
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,920
advances such as the internet, we're having
to screen out a lot more than our ancestors

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,119
did.
Now, how about things we really don't want

18
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:04,270
to know, as opposed to those we don't need
to? A good example is this age-old quandary:

19
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:10,810
A supernatural messenger materializes before
you, bearing a sealed envelope containing

20
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,810
the date and manner of your own demise. Would
you open it and read it? Reasons given by

21
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,400
people who say no typically refer to the aversive
emotional effects of this information, a desire

22
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,230
to have some surprises in store for the future,
and a feeling that this knowledge would reduce

23
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,400
the enjoyment of their life. Those who say
yes refer to advantages such as being able

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,120
to plan when to retire, and how best to provide
for loved ones after they've passed on. This

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,480
question also has stimulated the proliferation
of online "death clocks" that claim to be

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,620
able to predict when you'll die on the basis
of a few statistics.

27
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,370
Genetic testing is more here-and-now than
the prospect of death, and can raise the stakes

28
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,569
riding on what we choose not to know to a
very high level. One of the most agonizing

29
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:07,599
choices of this kind faces descendants of
Huntington's Disease sufferers. Huntington's

30
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,940
Disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder
with no known cure or prevention and very

31
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,010
little in the way of palliative treatment.
Symptoms begin with emotional disturbances

32
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,840
and loss of higher intellective functions,
followed by uncontrollable movements and ultimately

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,640
inability to control any movements.
The child of a Huntington's Disease parent

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,269
has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.
If they do inherit the disease, then each

35
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,150
of their children enters this 50-50 lottery,
whereas if they do not then their children

36
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,760
are not at risk of the disease. Now, here's
what makes this lottery very debilitating

37
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,610
indeed: Huntington's Disease usually manifests
itself only when the carrier is well into

38
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,640
adulthood (in their 30's or 40's), in other
words after they may have had families of

39
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,390
their own. Until the 1980's all that a child
of a Huntington's Disease parent could do

40
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,780
was wait and see whether they passed their
40's with no symptoms. The impact of this

41
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,430
uncertainty on young persons trying to plan
their lives would be hard to overstate.

42
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,780
Then a genetic marker test was developed for
diagnosing Huntington's Disease carriers.

43
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,129
The test was relatively inexpensive, it could
be taken at any age, and early surveys among

44
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:33,000
those at risk suggested that uptake rates
among them would be high. Arguments for Huntington's

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,999
Disease descendants to take this test would
seem unassailable. But in most countries where

46
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:46,999
testing is available, the uptake rate has
been low: 5%-20%. Why?

47
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:53,300
Self-report studies have elicited reasons
such as being comfortable with not knowing,

48
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,360
concerns about the irreversibility of knowing
the outcome, and fears associated with the

49
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,180
consequences of an unfavorable outcome. A
1992 study identified an additional clue.

50
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,789
Those electing to take the test viewed both
favorable and unfavorable outcomes as having

51
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:15,490
less extreme consequences for them and their
families than those refusing the test. That

52
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,599
is, they rated the favorable outcomes less
positively and the unfavorable outcomes less

53
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:24,789
negatively.
In recent times, reasons for and against taking

54
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:30,979
the test have become complicated by issues
such as insurability. A longitudinal 2008

55
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:36,319
study reported that for those taking the genetic
test during the study, loss of insurability

56
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,110
was their greatest concern and more than 40%
of them paid for other medical services to

57
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,990
conceal their genetic inheritance from insurers
and/or employers. As a recent article in Lancet

58
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,279
points out, there is little protection in
either North America or the UK (or, I might

59
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,689
add, in Australia) of Huntington's Disease
carriers against discrimination by insurers.

60
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:05,449
In the USA, the 2009 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act prohibits insurers from using genetic

61
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:12,449
information to determine eligibility, premiums,
or to compel individuals to undergo genetic

62
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:18,639
tests. However, it does not extend to life
insurance, disability insurance, or long-term

63
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,550
care insurance.
So there is a double set of issues here: One

64
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,389
regarding each person's accountability for
their decision to undergo genetic testing

65
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:33,219
or not, and the second regarding who else
should know about the results and what they

66
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:39,119
can and cannot do with that knowledge.
So far we've talked about things we choose

67
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:45,509
not to know. What about things we unconsciously
don't want to know. Should we also be held

68
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:52,139
accountable for those? Arguments have been
made that in some cases we should. Racism

69
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,689
theorist Charles Mills and Feminist theorists
Nancy Tuana and Erinn Gilson are exemplars

70
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:02,349
of such arguments.
Mills writes about "white ignorance", by which

71
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:08,139
he means a widespread tendency for Caucasians
to hold what often are unwitting false beliefs

72
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:14,009
about nonwhites. Mills is, in a sense, accusing
whites not only of being in denial about the

73
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,689
realities of white advantage, but also of
not wanting to learn about those realities.

74
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:25,119
In short, whites are both meta-ignorant and
negligent regarding their ignorance.

75
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:30,349
Tuana's version of this she calls "wilful
ignorance", which is similar to Mills' account:

76
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,789
A type of meta-ignorance combined with an
unwillingness to know. Tuana's and Gilson's

77
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,270
targets are men's ignorance about women's
sexuality and male violence towards women.

78
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,559
In their accounts, men are simultaneously
unaware of their ignorance and unwilling to

79
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:52,589
do anything about it.
Philosopher Slavoj Zizek also picked up this

80
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:58,369
theme in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal,
when from late 2003 to early 2004, during

81
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:03,899
the Iraq War, American military personnel
tortured, raped, sodomized, and killed prisoners

82
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:10,899
held in the Abu Ghraib prison. Zizek's 2004
op-ed piece observed that Donald Rumsfeld,

83
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,529
reciting Ann Kerwin's known knowns, known
unknowns, and unknown unknowns, failed to

84
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:22,389
mention unknown knowns. Remember, back in
the lecture on "Effective Thinking About Ignorance"

85
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:27,759
I referred to this as "tacit knowledge" and
gave benign examples such as how to ride a

86
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,759
bicycle. Zizek offers a Freudian dark-side
version. For him, these are "beliefs, suppositions

87
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,469
and obscene practices we pretend not to know
about, even though they form the background

88
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:45,100
to our public values". Whew!
Finally, what about the things we choose to

89
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,310
know that we would have been better off not
knowing? All of us probably can think of specific

90
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,329
instances, but are there categories of such
things? Most of us prefer to find out the

91
00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:00,480
causes and reasons behind our experiences,
good and bad. There's a large psychological

92
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,110
literature supporting the notion that making
sense out of negative or traumatic events

93
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,899
helps us to deal with and recover from them.
But what about the category of positive or

94
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:17,720
uplifting events? in 2005, Timothy Wilson
and his colleagues reported experiments demonstrating

95
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,459
what they called the "pleasure paradox", whereby
making sense out of pleasurable experiences

96
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:30,940
reduces the pleasure obtained from them.
One of their experiments had confederates

97
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,940
giving a dollar coin with a card to people
in a library. In one condition the card contained

98
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:45,079
arbitrary statements such as "The Smile Society"
and "We like to promote Random Acts of Kindness."

99
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:50,980
In another condition the card had a question-answer
explanation instead, where the arbitrary statement

100
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,980
was preceded by a question. The card then
said "Who are we? The Smile Society" or "Why

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,430
do we do this? We like to promote random acts
of kindness". About 5 minutes after each participant

102
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,629
received the card, an experimenter came along
and asked them to complete a brief mood survey

103
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:15,440
which included a self-rating of how positive
or negative the participant's mood was at

104
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,410
that moment. The mood scale was also given
to people in the library who had not received

105
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:26,829
a card at all. It turned out that those who
received the non-explanatory card were in

106
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:32,060
a better mood than those with the explanatory
card and those who did not receive a card

107
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,439
at all. Moreover, the explanatory card folks'
moods didn't differ from those who did not

108
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:43,300
receive a card.
Why would a pleasurable experience be less

109
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,860
pleasurable if it were explained? Wilson's
and colleagues' theory is that explaining

110
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,050
the event makes it less surprising, which
lessens the intensity of the emotion (whether

111
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,980
positive or negative) that surprises induce.
Wilson's team went one step further: They

112
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,660
asked another sample of people to forecast
which kind of card would make recipients feel

113
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,220
happier. A large majority of respondents predicted
that the explanatory card would be the more

114
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,269
pleasurable of the two. Our commonsense psychology
leads us astray in this case. Resolving our

115
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:24,269
ignorance about a positive event does not
make it more pleasurable. It may do the opposite.

116
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:30,060
In this lecture, we've navigated the territory
of things we never want to know. We've allowed

117
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:36,420
"want" to have three interpretations: Conscious,
unconscious, and a third-person sense (the

118
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,930
version where someone else tells us "you don't
want to know this"). And we've encountered

119
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,560
three problems in dealing with things we never
want to know.

120
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,689
First, things that seem unimportant or irrelevant
to us may not be. However, the answer to this

121
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:57,709
problem certainly is not trying to know more
and more. We just have to make our choices

122
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:02,410
and be prepared to reverse them if necessary,
and if it isn't too late.

123
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,800
Second, things we don't want to know because
they're too painful or awful also can come

124
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,629
back to bite us, partly because we may be
held accountable for not knowing them.

125
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:18,920
And finally, there are some things we would
like to know, but we'd be better off not knowing

126
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,920
them. The unexpected positive event is a counter-intuitive
example. Sometimes it just doesn't make sense

127
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,839
to make sense of the unexpected.
