Karin Knorr-Cetina (1999) first used the term
negative knowledge to refer to knowledge about

2
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:33,019
the limits of knowledge. This is a type of
meta-knowledge, and is a special case of known

3
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:40,019
unknowns. These are either things we cannot
know or taboos, the things we must not know.

4
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,350
In this lecture we'll focus on the things
we can't know.

5
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,969
There are two flavors of negative knowledge:
First, there is knowing what things are unknowable

6
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:56,969
(or must not be known) in a particular domain.
Second, knowing when everything is known in

7
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:02,430
a particular domain.
These two are related, and as we'll see, can

8
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,360
occur together. Let's focus on this first
kind to start with, and we'll return to the

9
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,670
second kind later in this lecture.
Simple examples of the first kind crop up

10
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,470
in exchanges like this one, which may be familiar
to some of you.

11
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,970
A: "Why didn't you get milk when you were
down at the grocers?"

12
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:25,600
B: "But you didn't tell me we needed more
milk. I'm not a mind-reader."

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,250
B is making a negative ignorance claim: B
cannot know what's in A's mind. B is, however,

14
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,890
also claiming that she could have known milk
was needed if A had mentioned it to her.

15
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,700
So, here's another important distinction:
There are things I cannot know but could be

16
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,440
known in principle, perhaps by other people.
However, there also are things none of us

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,060
can ever know.
I'll never know whether my brother Brian cut

18
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,780
himself shaving on the morning of April 13th,
2001. I wasn't there and he's forgotten, but

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,530
at the time he would have known that. Likewise,
neither he nor I, nor anyone else, knows now

20
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,480
whether he'll cut himself while shaving on
April 13th two years from now, or even whether

21
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,670
he's going to shave on that particular morning.
Why is negative knowledge important? There

22
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,790
are two reasons:
First, knowing that something cannot be known

23
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,620
tells us not to waste time and effort pursuing
it.

24
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,040
Second, the question of whether something
is unknowable may be debatable, and such debates

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,120
can raise and help us resolve important issues.
The fact that negative knowledge instructs

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,180
us to cease inquiry seems like a good thing,
and often it is. There's no use trying to

27
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,800
square the circle or invent a perpetual motion
machine; those things cannot be done.

28
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,830
But can negative knowledge be misapplied,
or can it mislead us? Peter Medawar (1967)

29
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,980
famously coined the aphorism that science
is the "art of the soluble". A commonsense

30
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,830
inference some people (including some scientists)
draw from this that if a problem is not soluble

31
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,150
then it isn't a scientific problem and therefore
should be banished from scientific inquiry.

32
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,910
However, by neglecting unsolvable problems
scientists exclude themselves from any input

33
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,660
into what people end up doing about those
problems. Problems that are virtually defined

34
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,349
by negative knowledge include wicked problems
and rude surprises.

35
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,849
The characteristics of wicked problems were
identified in the classic 1973 paper by Rittel

36
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:40,459
and Webber, and most of these referred to
various kinds of negative knowledge. Thus,

37
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,910
the very definition and scope of wicked problems
are unresolvable; such problems have no definitive

38
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,629
solutions; there are no ultimate tests of
whether a solution works; every wicked problem

39
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:58,629
is unique; and there are no opportunities
to learn how to deal with them by trial-and-error.

40
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:03,120
Claimants to the title of "wicked problem"
include how to craft policy responses to climate

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,120
change, how to combat terrorism, how to end
poverty, and how to end war. For example,

42
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,569
even if we grant that there is scientific
consensus on predicted global trends in climate

43
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,780
change, local or regional trends are much
more difficult to predict, and therefore it's

44
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,979
extremely difficult to evaluate the effects
of any climate change mitigation measures.

45
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:31,610
Rude surprises are not always wicked problems
but nonetheless are, as Todd La Porte describes

46
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,379
them, "unexpected, potentially overwhelming
circumstances that are likely to deliver punishing

47
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:44,379
blows to human life, to political or economic
viability, and/or to environmental integrity".

48
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,490
The eruption of AIDS in the 1980s and 90s
is an example, especially its impact on Africa.

49
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,050
So is the appearance of the hole in the ozone
layer in the early 1980's. And many financial

50
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,819
investors, advisors, and traders around the
world no doubt saw the 2008 global financial

51
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,659
crisis as a rude surprise.
So now let's return to the question of whether

52
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:12,659
wicked problems and rude surprises should
be ruled out of court for scientists. It may

53
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,330
seem strange to propose that problem-solvers
like mathematicians, scientists, or engineers

54
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,210
could make valuable contributions to problems
that can't be solved. However, people working

55
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,430
in those fields actually know what it is like
to debate about and live with irreducible

56
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,509
unknowns, and they may be able to help the
rest of us do so too.

57
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,369
Many of the sciences have undergone what some
commentators called a "loss of certainty"

58
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:44,860
in the 20th century.
What they're really referring to is advances

59
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,520
in negative knowledge. Take mathematics as
an example. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we

60
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,279
had a method of finding truths that was guaranteed
not to steer us wrong? Many non-mathematicians

61
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,990
think of mathematics as possessing such a
method. Early in the 20th century, mathematicians

62
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,779
had their hopes of finding this method dashed.
The tantalizing prospect before them was to

63
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:16,619
establish the consistency and completeness
of mathematics. Roughly speaking, consistency

64
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:23,309
amounts to a guarantee of never running into
paradoxes (these are well-formed mathematical propositions

65
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:29,610
that nevertheless are provably both true and
false) and completeness amounts to a guarantee

66
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:36,099
of never running into undecidables (well-formed
mathematical propositions whose truth or falsity

67
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:42,099
cannot be proven). These guarantees would
ensure that any mathematical proposition or

68
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:49,099
hypothesis would be provably true or false.
The would really tame the mathematical unknown.

69
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:55,759
The famous 1931 paper by Kurt Godel denied
this paradise forever. He showed that if any

70
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,939
mathematical theory adequate to deal with
whole numbers is consistent, it will be incomplete.

71
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:06,849
He also showed that if consistency could be
attained, its price would be incompleteness.

72
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:12,619
But is there a way to find out which mathematical
propositions are undecidable and which are provable?

73
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:17,999
Alan Turing's 1936 paper on "computable numbers"
showed that the answer to this question is

74
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:21,979
"no".
Did this negative knowledge cause the demise

75
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:26,869
of mathematics? Judging by the tremendous
creative output of mathematicians since then,

76
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:32,679
apparently not. So, mathematicians have been
living with quite severe negative knowledge

77
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:39,009
for almost a century. The rest of us might
learn something from observing just how they

78
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,639
do that.
What does a debate about negative knowledge

79
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,139
look like? And why does it matter? Think back
to the earlier point that knowing that something

80
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:53,659
cannot be known tells us not to waste time
and effort pursuing it. In short, deciding

81
00:07:53,659 --> 00:08:00,020
that something is unknowable tells us to give
up trying to know it. If we're wrong on this

82
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,209
about an important problem or question, then
we could miss out on knowing some very important

83
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,319
things.
To get a feel for all this, let's turn to

84
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,759
a debate about knowing when everything is
known in science, which was kick-started with

85
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,619
the publication in 1996 of John Horgan's book,
"The End of Science".

86
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:23,889
Horgan's thesis was that in many of the sciences,
the development of new theories has come to

87
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:30,629
a standstill because the current theories
are as far as humans can go in understanding

88
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:37,419
how the universe works. According to Horgan,
quantum theory and general relativity in physics

89
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,279
and molecular biology and the theory of natural
selection in biology are going to stand for thousands

90
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,040
of years and no basic improvements on them
are possible.

91
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,610
Such a claim is not new.
In 1903 the Nobel Laureate physicist Albert

92
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,759
Michelson declared that " The more important
fundamental laws and facts of physical science

93
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,009
have all been discovered, and these are now
so firmly established that the possibility

94
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:11,670
of their ever being supplanted in consequence
of new discoveries is exceedingly remote."

95
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:18,670
Light Waves and Their Uses, 1903.
Nor is dissent from it.

96
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:26,209
Leading mathematician and philosopher Alfred
North Whitehead: "The Universe is vast. Nothing

97
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:32,279
is more curious than the self-satisfied dogmatism
with which mankind at each period of its history

98
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:38,540
cherishes the delusion of the finality of
its existing modes of knowledge." Essays in

99
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,399
Science and Philosophy, 1948.

100
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,199
An interesting thread in the ensuing debate
about Horgan's thesis is a dispute over negative

101
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:56,199
knowledge. Horgan is saying that science is
running out of questions it can answer, which

102
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,389
entails a claim about negative knowledge:The
more we find out about the universe, the less

103
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:09,259
likely it is that we can understand it:
He says: "Our ability to describe the universe with

104
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:14,360
simple, elegant models stems in large part
from our lack of data, our ignorance. The

105
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,920
more clearly we can see the universe in all
its glorious detail, the more difficult it

106
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,420
will be for us to explain with a simple theory
how it came to be that way."

107
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,769
In a thoughtful, if outraged review, mathematician
David Hoffman (senior scientist at the Lawrence

108
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:35,430
Berkeley National Laboratory at the time)
had this to say about Horgan's negative knowledge

109
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,290
claim:
"Horgan ignores the complex interaction among

110
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:46,290
theory, experiment, and instrument building
which characterizes modern science, in particular

111
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:52,050
the regularity with which acquisition of fundamentally
new data challenges the very theory that initiated

112
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,899
the search for it."
Nearly two decades later, Washington Post

113
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:01,920
columnist Joel Achenbach returned to the end-of-science
question with these observations:

114
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,920
"Does anyone think that paleontology is running
out of questions? Randomly, off the top of

115
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:16,050
my head: What exactly caused the Permian mass
extinction (Siberian vulcanism?) and why did

116
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,860
some species survive while so many died out?
Were the dinosaurs fading even before the

117
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,709
K/T extinction event?..."
Achenbach then goes on to point out that short-sighted

118
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:33,439
bureaucratically driven lack of support for
long-term high-risk scientific inquiry is

119
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:38,629
more likely to hinder developments in science
than any limitations in human cognitive capacity.

120
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:44,790
So, there's a negative knowledge claim of
quite a different color.

121
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,540
This lecture has concentrated on negative
knowledge, that is, knowledge about the limits

122
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,819
of what we know or can possibly know. We've
examined the following issues.

123
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:59,490
First, knowing that something cannot be known
tells us not to waste time and effort pursuing

124
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,089
it.
However, some of the most important issues

125
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:08,310
humanity faces, such as wicked problems and
rude surprises, are characterized by negative

126
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:14,370
knowledge. And we can't afford to ignore them.
Negative knowledge is a crucial part of even

127
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,420
the most "certain" sciences (such as mathematics
and physics).

128
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,490
Finally, the question of whether something
is unknowable may be debatable, and such debates

129
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:32,490
can raise important questions, such as the
limits of science or of human cognition.

130
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,189
This week, we've presented a map of ignorance,
demonstrating that there are different kinds

131
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:43,069
of unknowns. By now you should be realizing
that ignorance isn't simply the opposite of

132
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:47,970
knowledge. We've also seen that we tend to
regard ignorance as a bad thing, when that

133
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,829
isn't always so. Next week we're going to
go more deeply into the question of when people

134
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:59,079
want ignorance and when they don't . That
investigation will open the way for understanding

135
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,799
where ignorance comes from and how it's created
and destroyed.
