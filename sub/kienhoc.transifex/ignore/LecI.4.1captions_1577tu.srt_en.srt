This week, we're going to return to a theme
introduced in the first week, namely that

2
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,039
there are different kinds of ignorance. Just
because we have a nice theoretical taxonomy

3
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,379
or typology doesn't mean that it describes
what distinctions people actually make and

4
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:40,500
act on. After all, as we'll see in a later
lecture, even the word "probability" didn't

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,170
have anything to do with chance until 1650,
and many languages don't distinguish between

6
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,440
concepts like vagueness and ambiguity. So,
what evidence can we find that people think

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,629
and act as though, for them, there are different
kinds of unknowns? We'll focus on a few specific

8
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:03,800
distinctions among different kinds, and explore
the consequences of those distinctions for

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,390
how people cope with unknowns. But first,
in this lecture, we are going to address the

10
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,560
"so what?" question. If people distinguish
among different kinds of ignorance, why is

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,100
that important? Then we'll briefly examine
the question of how we can find evidence for

12
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,000
this.
One line of argument for its importance is

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
an argument from consequences can be made if we think
there really is only one kind of ignorance

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,170
then it seems likely that we will have evolved
one reasonably effective way of assessing

15
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:42,170
it and taking it into account when making
decisions. Moreover, a rational agent should

16
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,890
have only one consistent and optimal method
of assessment and decision making.

17
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,840
But if we think there are different kinds,
then both psychologically functional and rational

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,729
arguments point to the desirability of having
distinct ways of dealing with each kind. Each

19
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,009
kind probably will serve a distinct psychological
function for us. Each kind also may have its

20
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,620
own special uses and roles. Some kinds even
may be specific to an historical epoch or

21
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,590
to a culture. The "rational" argument is that
our distinctions may be adaptive because they

22
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,890
map onto different kinds of unknowns in our
environment and guide our responses to those

23
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,209
unknowns.
Those of you who played both versions of the

24
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:31,120
Honey Bee Game probably will have realized
that there were different kinds of unknowns

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,530
in each version. Without entirely spoiling
things for those of you who haven't yet played

26
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,349
these games, here's a hint. The type of unknown
in the game has implications for whether keeping

27
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:47,980
the flowers from disappearing is a good strategy
or not.

28
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,340
Another line of argument has it that if people
think and act as though there are different

29
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,650
kinds of unknowns, then taking that into account
is important simply because it enhances our

30
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,150
understanding of human thought and behavior.
We'll explore several examples of this in

31
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,060
the lectures later this week, but let's take
a brief look at an example now. I'd like you

32
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:17,060
to ask yourself how you would regard the prospect
of betting in each of three tennis matches.

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,019
In Match 1, you know everything about players
A and B, and you know that their win-lose

34
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,680
record against each other is exactly 50-50.
Both are healthy and in good form for this

35
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,879
match. You could very reasonably regard Players
A and B as each having a probability of 1/2

36
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,860
of winning this match.
In Match 2, you know nothing about players

37
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,549
C and D, and nothing about their appearance
before the match tells you which one is the

38
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,840
better player. You could very reasonably regard
Players C and D as each having a probability

39
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,840
of anywhere from 0 to 1 of winning this match.
In Match 3, you also know nothing about players

40
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:04,280
E and F, but a good friend of yours who knows a lot
about them starts to tell you about the match.

41
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,750
He says that one player is much better than
the other, and is certain to win the match.

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,950
But your friend is distracted and removed
from you before he can tell you which player

43
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:19,950
it is. You could very reasonably regard Players
E and F as each having a probability of either

44
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:26,969
nearly 0 or nearly 1 of winning this match.
Do the unknowns in the three matches seem

45
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,539
different to you? Would you be more willing
to place a bet in one match than in another?

46
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:38,229
Or would you regard an even-money bet on either
player as equally reasonable for all three

47
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:42,919
matches? In the lectures to follow, we'll
find that there are interesting arguments

48
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,289
among philosophers and students of human behavior
about these questions.

49
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:54,139
A third line of argument for why the "different
kinds of ignorance" question is important

50
00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:00,430
is that it has bearing on whether and how
ignorance can be unmade. This argument requires

51
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,410
focusing on the sources of the unknowns rather
than on their characteristics. So far in this

52
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,000
course, we've encountered several different
kinds of sources.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,300
First, there is ignorance that is imposed
on us by powerful agents or socially constructed

54
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,240
in some other way. Last week's lecture on
the manufacture of doubt contains the most

55
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,560
straightforward examples of this kind of source.
If these are known unknowns, we can remove

56
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,220
the blinders or distortive lenses imposed
by authorities and their spin-doctors.

57
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,970
Socially constructed unknown knowns, on the
other hand, are extremely difficult to remove.

58
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,250
First, people in privileged positions are
motivated to view their position as legitimate

59
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,460
or even inevitable (e.g., believing that Caucasians
are a "master race" or that men are innately

60
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,039
"superior" to women). Second, the same people
are not motivated to critically inquire into

61
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:04,030
or test the veracity of such views. It is
very difficult to unmake ignorance that is

62
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:10,569
neither accessible to conscious inspection
nor desired to undo.

63
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:15,569
Now let's turn to self-imposed ignorance.
Again, the known unknowns are more readily

64
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:21,199
unmade than the unknown knowns, with an important
exception. Our motives for self-imposed ignorance

65
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,830
may be so strong that even when we are aware
that it is better to overcome it, we find

66
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,160
we're unable to do so.
Our self-imposed unknown unknowns include

67
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,550
cognitive illusions that are a type of ignorance
viewed as largely hard-wired into the human

68
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,590
brain. We've already seen some examples of
this, such as over-confidence, confirmation

69
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,860
bias, and hindsight bias.
The cognitive-illusion type of ignorance shares

70
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:54,660
a difficulty in its removal with some kinds
of socially constructed unknown unknowns.

71
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,449
Examples of these include situations where
the public believes a line of propaganda produced

72
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:06,449
by their government. These unknown unknowns
also are at the subconscious level. If so,

73
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,360
then conscious reflection on our mental processes
is not likely to be capable of even identifying

74
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:19,289
them, to say nothing of eliminating them.
Attempts at "consciousness raising" or "debiasing"

75
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:24,479
may backfire, in fact. As Scientific American
blogger Sam McNerney points out,

76
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,780
"Too often, readers finish popular books on
decision making with the false conviction

77
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:36,270
that they will decide better... The problem
is rooted in introspection. Biases are largely

78
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,000
unconscious, so when we reflect on thinking
we inevitably miss the processes that give

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
rise to our errors. Worse, because we're self-affirming
spin-doctors, when we introspect, we only

80
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:55,160
identify reasons for our infallibility. In
this light, we see why mere exposure to biases

81
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:02,050
compounds the problem: they actually make
us more confident about how we decide."

82
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,349
Now let's turn to the evidence we can find
for the distinctions people make among kinds

83
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:13,960
of unknowns? There are five varieties of evidence.
First, there are normative arguments: Can

84
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,800
a case be made that a rational agent would
distinguish one kind of ignorance from another?

85
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,699
Think about those three tennis matches, for
instance, or the two versions of the Honey

86
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,210
Bee Game.
Second, there is behavioral evidence: Does

87
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:34,010
one kind influence responses independently
of another kind?

88
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,919
Third, there is attitudinal evidence: Are
orientations towards one kind uncorrelated

89
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,060
with orientations towards another? Do people
who are relaxed about one kind of unknown

90
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,630
dread another kind?
Fourth is socio-cultural evidence: Do social

91
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,790
or cultural norms and practices distinguish
one kind from another, for example, in their

92
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,770
moral statuses? Do they play different roles
in social interaction? Are they distinguished

93
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:06,410
in language?
Fifth, neurological evidence: Are different

94
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:12,140
structures in the brain entrained by different
kinds? Does damage to one structure disable

95
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,020
people from dealing with one kind but still
allow them to deal with another?

96
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,140
To help us understand these kinds of evidence,
over the following lectures we'll focus on

97
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:29,140
four kinds of unknowns that look different,
but whose separate identities have been debated.

98
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,540
Probability: We know what all possible events
are that could occur, and we have precise

99
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,170
probabilities of their occurrence.
Ambiguity: We know what the possible events

100
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,850
are but we don't know their probabilities
precisely.

101
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,000
Conflict: We know what the possible events
are but we have disagreeing estimates of their

102
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,569
probabilities.
State space ignorance: We don't know what

103
00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:00,360
all the possible events are.
Note that the latter two kinds of unknowns

104
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,420
are not ones that we've mentioned so far,
but we'll see that they play important roles

105
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,059
in decision making in complex problems and
situations.

106
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:14,949
We'll focus primarily on normative, behavioral,
and attitudinal evidence at first, moving

107
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,959
on to a peek inside the brain later on in
the week. Also, much of the evidence we'll

108
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,850
be examining is from laboratory experiments
rather than naturalistic observations of what

109
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,480
happens in the real world. The reason for
this is that nailing down behavioral and neurological

110
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,459
evidence often requires experimental control.
However, in the final lecture this week we'll

111
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:42,920
shift to the socio-cultural level and return
to observations instead of experiments, examining

112
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,850
examples of how terms for various kinds of
unknowns, such as "probability" and "ignorance",

113
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,630
have changed throughout history.
