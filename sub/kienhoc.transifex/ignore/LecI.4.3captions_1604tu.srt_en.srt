In this lecture I'm going to take us close
to the cutting-edge of experimental research

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,529
on how people respond to unknowns arising
from ambiguity versus conflict. When I first

3
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,530
read Ellsberg's paper on ambiguity, I was
immediately intrigued by it and the literature

4
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,629
following on from it. I'd also read William
Empson's classic 1930 book on seven types

5
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:47,030
of ambiguity and Max Black's 1937 paper on
reasoning with vague concepts. It occurred

6
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:53,070
to me that some forms of ambiguity are analogous
to internal conflict. We speak of being "in

7
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,899
two minds" when we're undecided about something,
and we often simulate arguments back and forth

8
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,569
in our own heads. So perhaps ambiguity isn't
just a marker for variability. It could indicate

9
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:10,670
conflict as well. I decided to run some experiments
to see whether people respond to conflicting

10
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,890
evidence as they do to ambiguity, but also
pitting conflict against ambiguity. I had

11
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,890
a hunch that people would find unknowns arising
from conflict worse than ambiguity.

12
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,470
Here's the simplest of the experiments I used
to test all of this. Imagine that you're serving

13
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,330
on a jury, and an important aspect of the
prosecution's case turns on the color of the

14
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:40,330
vehicle seen leaving the scene of a nighttime
crime. Here are two possible scenarios involving

15
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:46,599
eyewitness testimony on this matter:
In scenario A, one eyewitness says the color

16
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:53,229
was blue, and another says it was green.
In scenario B, both eyewitnesses say the color

17
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:59,580
was either blue or green.
Which testimony would you rather receive?

18
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,310
In which do the eyewitnesses sound more credible?
If you're like most people, you'd choose scenario

19
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,340
B for both questions, despite the fact that
from a purely informational standpoint there

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,160
is no difference between them.
Evidence from this and other experiments I

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,160
conducted suggests that in general, we are
"conflict averse" in two ways. First, conflicting

22
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,819
messages from two equally believable sources
are dispreferred to two informatively equivalent,

23
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:33,290
ambiguous, but agreeing messages from the
same sources. If people are given a choice

24
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:39,800
between two precise but conflicting predictions
and two ambiguous (or vague) but agreeing

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,260
predictions, they'll prefer the ambiguous
agreeing predictions if everything else is

26
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,310
equal.
Second, the sources of precise but conflicting

27
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:56,310
predictions are perceived as less credible
than the sources of ambiguous agreeing predictions.

28
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,870
I found evidence that people seem to believe
experts ought to agree with each other. They

29
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,650
don't trust experts who disagree. Here's another
example.

30
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,050
In scenario A: About half the experts say
studies show that there is a link between

31
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,260
aluminium and Alzheimer's disease, while the
other half say studies do not show there is

32
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,349
such a link.
In scenario B: All experts say that about

33
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:27,530
half the studies show that there is a link
between aluminium and Alzheimer's disease,

34
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,060
while the other half do not show there is
such a link.

35
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,870
As in the eyewitness testimony setup, participants
rated the experts in scenario B as preferable

36
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,870
to and more credible than the experts in scenario
A. These effects aren't restricted to experts

37
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,140
but also include other authoritative sources,
such as professionals and even computer models.

38
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,780
I found these patterns in experiments asking
people to make decisions about eyewitness

39
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:00,780
testimony, risk messages, dieting programs,
and hiring and firing employees.

40
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,250
Nearly a decade later, Laure Cabantous confirmed
my results in a 2007 article demonstrating

41
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,730
that insurers would charge a higher premium
for insurance against mishaps whose risk information

42
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:19,730
was conflictive than if the risk information
was merely ambiguous but agreed-upon. So conflict

43
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,090
aversion isn't just something that affects
laypeople, it influences experts' decisions

44
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,910
in their own domain.
Many of us have an intuition that if there's

45
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,090
equal evidence for and against a proposition,
then both kinds of evidence should be accessed

46
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,690
by all knowledgeable, impartial experts in
that domain. If laboratory A produces 10 studies

47
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,880
supporting an hypothesis and laboratory B
produces 10 studies disconfirming the same

48
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,880
hypothesis, something seems dubious. The collection
of 20 studies will seem more trustworthy if

49
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,550
laboratories A and B each produce 5 studies
supporting the hypothesis and 5 disconfirming

50
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,160
it, even though there are still 10 studies
for and 10 studies against the hypothesis.

51
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,330
We expect experts and laboratories to agree
with one another, even if their overall message

52
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:17,740
is inconclusive. Being confronted with sharply
disagreeing experts sets off alarms for most

53
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,560
of us because it suggests that something untoward
is going on. For instance, the experts may

54
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,889
not be impartial, or they may not have reviewed
the same evidence.

55
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,199
The fact that people attribute greater credibility
to agreeing-ambiguous sources than conflicting-precise

56
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,199
sources poses strategic difficulties for the
sources themselves. In fact, those sources

57
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:48,949
become locked into a social dilemma. Communicators
embroiled in a controversy face a decisional

58
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,320
dilemma, when considering communications strategies
while knowing that other communicators hold

59
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,320
views contrary to their own. If they "soften
up" by conceding a point or two to the opposition

60
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,780
they might win credibility points from their
audience, but their opponents could play them

61
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,780
for suckers by not conceding anything in return.
On the other hand, if everyone concedes nothing

62
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:20,360
then they all could lose credibility.
Now let's look at what happens when ambiguity

63
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,990
and conflict are combined. Why should we want
to do this? It's because many real situations

64
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:33,120
involve both kinds of unknowns. I've been
studying how people assess conflict, ambiguity,

65
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,600
and their overall uncertainty about multiple
predictions of the same event that have both

66
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,400
conflict and ambiguity in them. In several
experiments, I've presented participants with

67
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,919
comparisons between two pairs of experts'
predictions like the one you're seeing in

68
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,430
the slide now.
In this slide, we have one pair of experts,

69
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,520
Albert and Brenda, making predictions about
the increase in global average temperature

70
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,520
over the next century. Both say the increase
will be somewhere between 2 and 4 degrees.

71
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,930
The second pair of experts, Carla and David,
sharply disagree with one another. Carla says

72
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:17,699
the increase will be 2 degrees but David says
it will be 4 degrees. What I ask participants

73
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:23,479
to do is to rate how much conflict there is
between each pair of experts' predictions,

74
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,400
how much ambiguity there is in each pair,
and how much overall uncertainty there is

75
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,509
in each pair.
I tested four hypotheses.

76
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:38,930
First, do greater differences between corresponding
pairs of interval endpoints make people perceive

77
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,080
greater conflict between the estimates? I
expected the answer to this question to be

78
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,699
"yes".
Second, if two experts' estimates are intervals

79
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:54,900
that have the same midpoint, do people see
them as having no conflict? I expected the

80
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,699
answer to this question to be "yes".
Third, if both pairs of intervals span the

81
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:06,830
same range of values, do people see them as
having equal conflict or equal ambiguity?

82
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,770
I expected the answer to this question to
be "no".

83
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,110
And fourth, do people's perceptions of degrees
of conflict and ambiguity both contribute

84
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:21,960
independently to their perceptions of overall
uncertainty? Or does one of these (either

85
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,660
conflict or ambiguity) dominate perceptions
of uncertainty? My hypothesis was that both

86
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,569
would contribute.
How did things turn out? Not entirely as I

87
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:39,259
expected!
My first hypothesis was shot down because

88
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:43,569
people did not seem to distinguish between
the amounts of conflict in the two pairs of

89
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:48,920
estimates shown in this slide. So, greater
differences between corresponding pairs of

90
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,390
interval endpoints do not necessarily make
people perceive greater conflict between the

91
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,690
estimates.
Contrary to my second hypothesis, the results

92
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,130
strongly indicated that people do see conflict
between pairs of intervals that differ in

93
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:10,130
width, even if they share the same midpoint.
At least my third hypothesis was supported.

94
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,830
Even if both pairs of intervals span the same
range of values, people may not see them as

95
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,500
having equal conflict or equal ambiguity.
However, one of the findings in support of

96
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,220
this hypothesis threw up a major surprise
for me. None of my models or those in the

97
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,290
economic literature anticipated that a nested
pair of intervals with a shared midpoint would

98
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:37,130
be regarded as more conflictive than a non-nested
overlapping pair whose pairs of endpoints

99
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:43,930
differed identically to the nested pair. These
are the two pairs shown in the current slide.

100
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,580
It seems that people are sensitive not only
to disagreement about the location and endpoints

101
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,980
of interval estimates, but also disagreement
about their width: that is, disagreement between

102
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,980
experts about how uncertain they are.
Finally, my fourth hypothesis also was supported

103
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,300
by the data. People do seem to take both ambiguity
and conflict into account when they think

104
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,790
about overall uncertainty.
As you can see, we're just beginning to understand

105
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,390
how ignorance arising from conflicting information
differs from ignorance that arises from ambiguity

106
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:24,470
or vagueness. Nevertheless, we do have a few
findings that look as though they may stand

107
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:31,470
up under further tests. In general, people
find precise but conflicting statements worse

108
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:39,390
than imprecise but agreeing ones. Next time
you watch a group or committee trying to build

109
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:45,260
a workable consensus, I'll bet that you'll
find they do so by making the consensus a

110
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,930
bit vague or ambiguous. If it's too precise,
then there will be disagreements. The group

111
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,060
will tolerate ambiguity in order to avoid
conflict.

112
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,620
We've also seen that people respond to conflict
and ambiguity as if they are separate kinds

113
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:08,620
of unknowns, and both are distinct from probability.
So, we have behavioral evidence that these

114
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,420
three are different kinds of unknowns. But
so far, we've left an important part of the

115
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:21,420
decision task locked in with complete certainty:
Knowledge of the possible outcomes. What happens

116
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,550
when we face situations where we don't know
what all the possible outcomes are? Let's

117
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,880
find out about this in the next lecture.
