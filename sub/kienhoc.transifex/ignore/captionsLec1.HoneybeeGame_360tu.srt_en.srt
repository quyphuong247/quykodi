The games in this course are designed to enable
you to experience specific kinds of unknowns,

2
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,780
while having a bit of fun, and learning about
how to make decisions or choices when you

3
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,570
don't have all the information that you might
like to have.

4
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,199
The Honey Bee Game is a foraging game.
You fly a honey bee around a garden with nectar-bearing

5
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,570
flowers, and the object is to get as many
hits of nectar as you possibly can out of

6
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,149
the number of feeding attempts that you make.
Now, some of the flowers are more nectar-bearing

7
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,750
than others, they're more productive.
So, some of them may be worth visiting more

8
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,530
often than others.
Let's take a look at the game itself, and

9
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,720
I'll give you a couple of tips about how to
play it.

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,780
OK, here's our bee, and it's in the garden
with four flowers to choose from.

11
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,410
You orient the bee with your mouse.
It points toward your cursor.

12
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:24,410
You can fly the bee with your arrow keys.
They give you eight directions in which to

13
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,300
fly the bee.
When you place the bee's head over a flower,

14
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,780
you can get it feed by left-clicking your
mouse-- like this.

15
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,229
You'll see a brief golden glow, and that indicates
that it's feeding.

16
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,700
You'll see the scoreboard changing as well.
It will tell you the number of attempts you've

17
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,280
made to feed, and the total number of hits
of nectar you've managed to score.

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,789
Notice also that the flowers start repeatedly
closing after a while.

19
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:02,709
And, in fact, if they do this for a minute,
then they disappear.

20
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:09,709
That means you can't feed from them anymore.
So, to keep a flower alive, you have to feed

21
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,810
from it at least once every minute or so.
The game ends after you've made 240 feeding

22
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,459
attempts.
Well, that's all there is to the Honey Bee

23
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,160
Game; it's very simple.
You can play it as many times as you like,

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,750
and we'll ask you a few questions about it
in the quizzes.

25
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,060
See if you can beat my top score, which so
far is 165 hits out of 240 attempts.

26
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,260
Good luck!
