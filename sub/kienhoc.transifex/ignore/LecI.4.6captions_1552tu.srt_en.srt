In this lecture we're going to get out of
the brain and individual behavior, and haul

2
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,320
ourselves up into the higher levels of culture
and society. I've already hinted that terms

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,370
for ignorance are by no means unchanging throughout
history. We're going to explore a few examples

4
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,510
of how these terms have  altered over
time and what drives those alterations. We'll

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,339
focus mainly on English-language terms, but
similar investigations could (and should)

6
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:54,339
be carried out into ignorance terms in other
languages. Why is this important? Language

7
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:01,399
is the primary medium in which humans think.
So the linguistic repertoire of terms and

8
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:07,380
meanings for representing and expressing ignorance
crucially influences how we think about it.

9
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,060
And why does this material belong in this
week? This week's material has been all about

10
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,960
the distinctions people make among kinds of
ignorance. Which distinctions are hard-wired

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,390
into the brain, and which depend on our culture
and the times in which we live? If we were

12
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,200
to revive even recent ancestors, could we
talk about ignorance with them? Or would the

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,420
gulf be too wide to cross? Let's start with
probability, a term that has the hallmarks

14
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,720
of universality, but turns out to be unexpectedly
specific to its time and circumstance.

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,250
Ian Hacking's classic 1975 book, The Emergence
of Probability, posed the following question.

16
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,439
Games of chance go back to antiquity, so concepts
such as the number of times an event occurs

17
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,250
out of the number of occasions on which it
could occur literally is as old as rolling

18
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,840
sheeps' knuckles and tossing coins. Our ancient
forebears clearly understood games of chance

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,530
quite well, and they certainly knew concepts
such as a fair die or a balanced coin. So

20
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,700
why does the concept of probability and its
mathematics not appear in Europe until the

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,690
middle of the 17th century? For Hacking, the
path to an answer to this question takes us

22
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,470
straight into language, and he excavates the
earlier meanings of the term "probability"

23
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,579
to prove his point.
The Latin word probabilis apparently meant

24
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:42,190
something like "worthy of approbation", and
therefore clearly had no connection with concepts

25
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,889
like chance, likelihood, or randomness. However,
Hacking points out that there are subtler

26
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:54,010
nuances that need to be taken into account.
First, the medieval sense of probability connected

27
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,699
it with opinion rather than knowledge, that
is, views adopted in the absence of clear

28
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:05,760
evidence. So the term probability was disconnected
from any concept of evidence, let alone a

29
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,760
notion such as likelihood. Second, the operationalization
of "worthy of approbation" usually was made

30
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:19,720
by referring to approval by some authority.
This removes the term probability even further

31
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,660
from any association with direct empirical
evidence. Probability, then, before the mid-17th

32
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:32,660
century, means the approvability of an opinion
by authorities. Greater or lesser probability

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,570
is indicated by the number and stature of
the authorities who have underwritten an opinion.

34
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:44,199
The scientists and natural philosophers of
the Renaissance have no use for a term like

35
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,320
"probability", because they are pursuing knowledge
on the basis of evidence, not opinion.

36
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:56,070
In 1657 Huygens published the first probability
textbook, but he never used the word "probability".

37
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,570
At about that time Blaise Pascal made the
first applications of probabilistic reasoning

38
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:08,570
to matters other than games of chance, inventing
decision theory as a result. The 1662 treatise

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
on logic produced by Pascal and his associates
at Port Royal is the first book to use the

40
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:23,030
term "probability" to describe numerical measurements
of the likelihood of evidence. By the late

41
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,910
1660,s probability theory was being used to
determine premiums for annuities in Holland

42
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,040
and in England. Hacking,s explanation for
this seemingly sudden hijacking of probability

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,480
refers to a long-held view among natural philosophers
and mathematicians that probability, in the

44
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,410
older traditional sense, really should reflect
evidence and not just approval by authorities.

45
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,690
The stage was set, then, for someone like
Pascal, both a mathematician and a religious

46
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:58,190
person, to transform "probability" into a
term entirely dependent on evidence rather

47
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,830
than approval.
What about terms for ignorance itself? Where

48
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,310
can we find data that will tell us something
about how those terms have been used throughout

49
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:15,310
history? Google's Ngram comprises a database
of millions of books and/or excerpts from

50
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,470
books, ranging over more than three centuries.
One of the many fun things you can do with

51
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,870
Ngram is to enter one or more terms and get
Ngram to graph how often your terms appear

52
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,510
in the corpus of, say, English-language books.
You can then download the data and analyse

53
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:40,090
it to your heart's content. And of course,
that's exactly what I did: How could I resist?

54
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:46,280
As the graph in this slide illustrates, entering
the terms for not knowing such as "ignorance",

55
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,180
"ignorant", "uncertain", "unknown", and "falsehood"
into the Ngram corpus of English-language

56
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,500
books reveals a consistent trend, namely a
decline in the relative frequency of these

57
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,500
terms from the beginning of the 19th to the
end of the 20th centuries, with a recent upturn.

58
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,920
A technical aside for fellow geeks out there:
The ordinate in the graph is the log-odds

59
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,530
of a term being mentioned in a given year.
Anyhow, all five of these terms share this

60
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,960
pattern.
But what could be driving this decline? How

61
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,550
about God? This next graph shows a very similar
decline in references to God, again with the

62
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,950
upturn at the end of the 20th century. For
example, the correlation between the relative

63
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:37,870
frequencies of the terms "ignorance" and "God"
over this period is .9. Even if we just look

64
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,010
at the correlation between the successive
differences in each of these series, thus

65
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,240
ignoring their shared overall trend, we still
get a correlation that is moderately positive

66
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,650
at about .3.
Google Ngram permits partial views of the

67
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,430
books in which our terms are mentioned. Close
inspection of those books reveals that the

68
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,060
trends in these ignorance terms over time
are driven by the decline in certain kinds

69
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:09,740
of religious discourses and, later on, the
rise of specific kinds of secular philosophical

70
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,680
and scientific discourses. Many of the earlier
occurrences are (largely Christian) religious

71
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,669
discourses chiefly concerning the culpability
of sinners who are ignorant of their sins,

72
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:26,240
of those who are involuntarily ignorant of
specific Christian doctrines, and of God's

73
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,139
judgment on those who have never been exposed
to the Scriptures.

74
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,919
The more recent secular discourses concern
epistemological questions regarding the nature

75
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,290
of ignorance and whether there are unresolvable
unknowns, but they also carry debates about

76
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:49,290
the morality of ignorance into the secular
realm. Over nearly two centuries, this corpus

77
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,850
of books reflects both the relativisation
and secularization of ignorance as a concept

78
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:01,850
and, implicitly, the gradual disappearance
of an all-knowing deity and the emergence

79
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,419
of one of the most profound concepts of the
Enlightenment: That there may be matters unknown

80
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:14,419
to and unknowable by any being in the universe,
that is, universal irreducible ignorance.

81
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,290
Up to then, everything was presumed known
by some deity or deities, regardless of whether

82
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,260
humans were ignorant or not.
Do all terms relating to ignorance show this

83
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:33,260
decline? No. Here are a couple of counter-examples.
"Serendipity" was coined by Horace Walpole

84
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,860
in 1754, via a Persian fairy tale, The Three
Princes of Serendip, whose heroes made unintended

85
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,630
discoveries by "accidents and sagacity". Serendip
is an old name for Sri Lanka. Despite being

86
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,500
coined in the mid-18th century, serendipity
didn't appear in the corpus of books until

87
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,360
more than a century later. After a stuttering
start, it climbed rapidly in popularity throughout

88
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,230
the 20th century, although its occurrence
rate may have peaked.

89
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:09,120
Much the same can be said for some epistemological
terms related to the unknown or unknowable.

90
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,870
Take "relativism", for instance. It shows
much the same rise and recent peak as serendipity,

91
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:21,870
although it took off about 50 years earlier
than serendipity did. "Serendipity" and "relativism"

92
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:29,190
do not share roots with terms such as "ignorance"
in the kinds of religious discourses described

93
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:36,190
earlier. They are thoroughly modern terms,
and so their usages have taken different trajectories.

94
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,740
Several years ago, I wrote "It is difficult
to communicate clearly about uncertainty,

95
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,010
and even more difficult to find out very much
about it. However, it is not so difficult

96
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:53,320
to find out how people talk about uncertainty,
what they think it is, and how they deal with

97
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,020
it." Finding out how we talk about ignorance
is the key to nearly every variety of understanding

98
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,000
we can obtain about how we think and act on
it, how we feel about it, and how we collectively

99
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,400
construct it.
The discipline of linguistics has much to

100
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,890
contribute here but has been largely silent
on this topic, until Nina Janich and Anne

101
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:22,890
Simmerling came along. In their recent publications,
they apply linguistics to the study of ignorance.

102
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,990
As they say, "speaking (and writing) about
uncertainty and ignorance ... is a linguistic

103
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,350
issue through and through", and they have
outlined an ambitious research program to

104
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,580
get things going. Given both the recent advances
in theory and methods in linguistics and the

105
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,570
capacity to access "big data" via the net,
the linguistic study of ignorance terms is

106
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,880
ripe for the picking. As you've seen in this
and earlier lectures, I've conducted some

107
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,580
preliminary studies of how we use language,
metaphors, and mathematics to represent ignorance.

108
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,490
I'm really looking forward to seeing what
linguists can do with this material.
