Late in my childhood I discovered that if
I was vague enough about my opinions no-one

2
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,900
could prove me wrong. It was a short step
to realizing that if I was totally vague I'd

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,730
never be wrong. What is the load-bearing capacity
of the elevator in my building? If I say "anywhere

4
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,120
from 0 tons to infinity" then I can't be wrong.
What's the probability that Samantha Stosur

5
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,390
will win a Grand Slam tennis title next year?
If I say "anywhere from 0 to 1" then once

6
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,210
again I can't be wrong.
There is at least one downside to vagueness,

7
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,899
though: Indecision. Vagueness can be paralyzing.
If the elevator's designers' estimate of its

8
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:01,469
load-bearing capacity had been 0-to-infinity
then no-one could decide whether any load

9
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,710
should be lifted by it. If I can't be more
precise than 0-to-1 about Stosur's chances

10
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,090
of winning a Grand Slam title then I have
no good reason to bet on or against that occurrence,

11
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,950
no matter what odds the bookmakers offer me.
Nevertheless, in situations where we don't

12
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,240
know much but are called upon to estimate
something, some amount of vagueness seems

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,850
not only natural but also appropriately cautious.
You don't have to look hard to find vagueness;

14
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:38,240
you can find it anywhere from politics to
measurement. When you weigh yourself, your

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,689
scale may only determine your weight within
plus or minus half a kilogram. Even the most

16
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:50,689
well-informed engineer's estimate of load-bearing
capacity will have some interval around it.

17
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,770
The amount of imprecision in these cases is
determined by what we know about the limitations

18
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:02,770
of our measuring instruments or our mathematical
models of load-bearing structures.

19
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,780
How would a sensible decision maker work with
vague estimates? Suppose our elevator specs

20
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,010
say the load-bearing capacity is between 3800
and 4200 pounds. Our worst-case estimate is

21
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,370
3800. We would be prudent to use the elevator
for loads weighing less than 3800 pounds and

22
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,639
not for ones weighing more than that. But
what if our goal was to overload the elevator?

23
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:33,160
Then to be confident of overloading it, we'd
want a load weighing more than 4200 pounds.

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,199
A similar prescription holds for betting on
the basis of probabilities. We should use

25
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,040
our lowest estimated probability of an event
for considering bets that the event will happen

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,139
and our highest estimated probability for
bets that the event won't happen. If I think

27
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,079
the probability that Samantha Stosur will
win a Grand Slam title next year is somewhere

28
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:01,799
from 1/2 to 3/4 then I should use 1/2 as my
betting probability on Stosur winning, and

29
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:08,690
if I'm going to bet against it then I should
use 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 as my betting probability

30
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,639
against Stosur. For any odds offered to me
corresponding to a probability inside my 1/2

31
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:19,690
to 3/4 interval, I don't have any good reason
to accept or reject a bet for or against Stosur.

32
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,630
Are there decisions where vagueness serves
no distinct function? Yes: Two-alternative

33
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,320
forced-choice decisions. A two-alternative
forced choice compels the decision maker to

34
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,790
elect one threshold to determine which alternative
is chosen. Either we put a particular load

35
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,070
into the elevator or we do not, regardless
of how imprecise the load-bearing estimate

36
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:47,070
is. The fact that we use our worst-case estimate
of 3800 pounds for our decisional threshold

37
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,320
makes our decisional behavior no different
from someone whose load-bearing estimate is

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,940
precisely 3800 pounds.
It's only when we have a third "middle" option

39
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:03,000
(such as not betting either way on Stosur)
that vagueness influences our decisional behavior

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
differently from a precise estimation. That
difference can turn out to be profoundly important.

41
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:16,780
Let's take a look at a real-world example.
An actuarial violence risk assessment tool

42
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,780
presented in the journal "Law and Human Behavior"
in 2000, used 989 discharged psychiatric patients'

43
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,280
follow-up data after their release. 18.7%
of the discharged patients in their sample

44
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,810
committed a violent act within 20 weeks after
discharge. The clinical researchers were able

45
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,650
to derive a very effective model for predicting
the probability of an outpatient committing

46
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,770
a violent act on the basis of the contents
of the hospital database.

47
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,940
They decided to classify any case with a predicted
probability of violence greater than twice

48
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,480
the base prevalence rate (more than .37) in
the high-risk category, which would require

49
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,570
close monitoring and constant therapeutic
follow-up. Any case whose predicted probability

50
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:10,570
of violence was less than half the base prevalence
rate (less than .09) they assigned to the

51
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,830
low-risk category, which meant there would
be nothing more than the usual periodic appointments

52
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,830
with the therapist. The middle group they
described as "unclassified". These are those

53
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,840
whose predicted probability of a violent act
was between .09 and .37. The recommendation

54
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,000
for these ex-patients was more frequent therapist
appointments, but not the close monitoring

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,850
or interventions required for the high-risk
group.

56
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:43,620
Now, what about the probability thresholds
for the high risk and the low risk group:

57
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,870
Where did these come from? They just seem
to spring out of thin air. However, they possess

58
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,710
the key to the values and preferences held
by the decision maker. In an article published

59
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,670
in 2006, I proved that these thresholds correspond
to the preferences of a rational agent for

60
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:08,620
whom the consequences of wrongly classifying
a violent patient are weighted much more heavily

61
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,500
than the consequences of wrongly classifying
a nonviolent patient.

62
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,580
And this is where vagueness starts to earn
its keep: By invoking a middle option. It

63
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,580
allows us to distinguish between those cases
that really require action, those where we

64
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,650
don't have to bother, and the middle group
where we should exercise some cautionary measures

65
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:36,710
such as more testing or more observation.
You can see this middle option being utilized

66
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:43,139
all the time in medical diagnoses: Either
recommend treatment, send the patient home,

67
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,710
or (middle option) bring the patient in for
further tests and examination.

68
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,430
Earlier I mentioned the relative weight given
to the consequences of wrongly classifying

69
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,720
a violent patient versus wrongly classifying
a nonviolent patient. Those weights, along

70
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,250
with our intuitive probability thresholds,
determine when having a middle option is worthwhile,

71
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,919
that is, when vagueness pays off.
Here's another example from our old friend,

72
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,580
courtroom trials, and it illustrates what
happens when our values conflict with the

73
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,260
alternatives we're given. We've already seen
that the Scottish system with its "Not Proven"

74
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,639
alternative has been the subject of controversy,
due to the belief that it gives juries a let-out

75
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,240
from returning Guilty verdicts. Not Proven
is essentially a mild acquittal. About one-third

76
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,230
of all jury acquittals in Scotland are the
product of a Not Proven verdict.

77
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:46,050
Can an argument be made in favor of Not Proven?
A classic paper by Terry Connolly in 1987

78
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,669
pointed out that a typical threshold probability
of guilt associated with the phrase "beyond

79
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:57,419
reasonable doubt" is in the [0.9, 1] range.
For a logically consistent juror a threshold

80
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,370
probability of 0.9 implies the difference
between the subjective value of acquitting

81
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,900
versus convicting the innocent is 9 times
the difference in the value of convicting

82
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,990
versus acquitting the guilty. Connolly demonstrated
that the relative valuations of the four possible

83
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,620
outcomes (convicting the guilty, acquitting
the innocent, convicting the innocent and

84
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,030
acquitting the guilty) that are compatible
with such a high threshold probability are

85
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,830
counterintuitive. Specifically, he observed
that ". . . if one does [want to have a threshold

86
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:36,399
of 0.9], one must be prepared to hold the
acquittal of the guilty as highly desirable,

87
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,979
at least in comparison to the other available
outcomes". He also showed that more intuitively

88
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:49,979
reasonable valuations of trial outcomes lead
to unacceptably low threshold probabilities.

89
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,710
So there is a conflict between the high threshold
probability required by "beyond reasonable

90
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:02,710
doubt" and the relative value we place on
acquitting the guilty versus convicting them.

91
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,440
In the previously mentioned 2006 paper I showed
that incorporating a third middle option with

92
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,150
a suitable mid-range threshold probability
can resolve this quandary, permitting a rational

93
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:21,150
juror to retain a high conviction threshold
and still evaluate false acquittals as negatively

94
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,110
as false convictions.
In short, a middle option like Not Proven

95
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,000
would seem to be just the ticket. The price
paid for this solution is a more stringent

96
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,630
standard of proof for outright acquittal than
any probability of guilt shy of .9, because

97
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,750
Not Proven requires a standard of proof between
.9 and some lower probability. As I mentioned

98
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,370
in a lecture in week 3, two of my students
and I found that this is exactly what people

99
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,210
do if they are offered the Not Proven option.
Vagueness earns its keep through the value

100
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:00,020
of the middle option that it invokes in situations
where otherwise we would have to decide which

101
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,529
of two alternatives is the case. With no vagueness,
a sharp probability commands us to decide

102
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,089
for one alternative and against the other.
We have to decide either the person has the

103
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:17,960
disease or they don't, or either the defendant
is guilty or they are innocent. A vague probability

104
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,520
that they have the disease invites us to introduce
a middle alternative: For example, further

105
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:29,430
investigation, more testing. Vagueness admonishes
us not to be too hasty in deciding one way

106
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,770
or the other, so it may save us from making
a premature choice. This is where it earns

107
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,290
its keep.
The converse holds, too. When we allow a middle

108
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,160
option, it implicitly invokes vagueness in
our predictions and advises caution. In betting

109
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,890
or investment, the tradeoff is cautiousness
versus seizing opportunities for high returns.

110
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,120
For those of you who have been playing the
InvestorRandom game, you've probably figured

111
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,940
out that the long-run expectation is that
you'll break even, if you choose to buy or

112
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,610
sell on every turn. But there's a way to beat
the odds, because you have a third option

113
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,320
available: Neither buy nor sell. So, start
off buying or selling until your fund has

114
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,029
risen above its initial $1000 value. Then
choose the "observe the next result" option

115
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:23,160
for the rest of the game. You won't make a
lot of money this way, but you'll always come

116
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,490
out ahead.
