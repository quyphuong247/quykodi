The topic for this lecture is indecision and
indecisiveness: Not knowing how to choose.

2
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:35,329
For this, I decided to call on an expert,
Stephen Tang. He joined me in the studio for

3
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:41,550
what I think you'll find is a fascinating
interview.

4
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,550
Stephen Tang is one of my PhD students, and
his thesis is about indecision and indecisiveness.

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,430
He knows a lot more about these topics than
I do, so I'm going to let him do most of the

6
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,670
talking.
So, Stephen, what got you interested in indecision

7
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,449
and indecisiveness?
Thanks Mike. I became interested in indecision

8
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:07,640
and indecisiveness through studying the psychology
of decision-making. We quickly get the point

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,960
that we're pretty bad choosers-- at least
that we're hardly rational in the classical

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,460
economic sense. And we're also bad at knowing
what we want or what will make us happy.

11
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,140
But in all of this, there's this assumption
that we're perfectly content and able to

12
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,049
choose anyway. That choosing is somehow
instantaneous and effortless; it's just the

13
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:35,280
outcomes of our decisions that are less than
ideal. I think this view neglects that deciding

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,679
can be difficult, and people can be reluctant
to choose, even if they like the idea of choice.

15
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:46,770
I'm also influenced by my training in clinical
psychology, and, of course, my own personal experience

16
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,819
comes into this too: I'm terrible at making decisions!
I thought that by researching indecision and

17
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:58,770
indecisiveness I could learn the tricks to
overcome my own difficulty with deciding and choosing.

18
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,450
But I've since changed my mind about this: or
maybe I just haven't decided what to do yet.

19
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,950
Well, let's come back to that a bit later. What's
the difference between indecision and indecisiveness?

20
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,430
There's a lot of confusion between these two
terms, and they're usually treated as if they

21
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,520
mean the same thing.
But as I see it, indecision relates to the

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,959
right-now experience of having difficulty
with a decision. It's an immediate psychological

23
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,530
state. At the acute end, this is the feeling
of overload and paralysis -- feeling "stuck"

24
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,220
-- along with the emotions of irritation,
frustration and stress. And there's also the

25
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,810
self-doubt and critical internal chatter which
gets louder as your inability to choose continues.

26
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,099
This could be in a big life-changing decision,
like the slow, gut-wrenching process of working

27
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:53,099
out whether or not to stay in a relationship.
But indecision pops up in other more mundane

28
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,680
places too, for example, when you're in the
supermarket and you suddenly realize that

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,239
you've been trying to choose a breakfast cereal
for far too long and still don't have anything

30
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,730
in your basket.
Indecision isn't just the absence of a decision.

31
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,400
It has to include some kind of subjective
experience of difficulty.

32
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,439
And what about indecisiveness?
Indecisiveness is the overall tendency to

33
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,680
find decisions difficult. It's part of a person's
character. But being indecisive is more than

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,439
just experiencing indecision over and over
again.

35
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,939
Indecisiveness also involves scanning the
environment and looking over the horizon for

36
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:40,909
upcoming decisions. Decisions are seen as
disruptive, threatening or overwhelming impositions

37
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:46,760
which you're not capable of handling. Indecisive
people have particularly sensitive antennae

38
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,459
to looming decisions.
Indecisiveness can actually mean successfully

39
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:00,459
avoiding the experience of indecision by delegating
decisions, procrastinating or even pre-deciding.

40
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:07,909
This isn't a bad thing: but too much vigilant
indecisiveness can intensify both the apprehension

41
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:12,200
and the negative experience of indecision
when a choice really must be made.

42
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,920
Why, do you think, are indecision and indecisiveness
often pathologized?

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,950
There are some good reasons to pathologise
indecision and indecisiveness, but perhaps

44
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:29,310
we could flip the question around: why do
we value decisiveness so much?

45
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,520
Since at least the time of Aristotle, we find
constant affirmations that decisiveness is

46
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,889
an important personal quality. For many philosophers,
it's because our decisions reveal our character

47
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:46,069
and are the stepping-stones to a virtuous
and flourishing life. So a failure to choose,

48
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:51,039
being indecisive, is a failure of the will.
It's a failure to live fully and a failure

49
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,840
to take responsibility for our lives and in
our social roles.

50
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,319
The interesting thing though, is that the
virtue of decisiveness isn't located so much

51
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,889
in the outcomes of our choices. Descartes'
advice, for example, is to get into the habit

52
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,069
of being decisive and resolute, even if you're
wrong. If you choose badly, stand by your

53
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:14,770
choice. And keep choosing. This sounds strange,
but the reason behind it is that decision-making

54
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,259
is an acquired practice. It shapes you and
your world over time, so don't let some bad

55
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,750
outcomes get in the way of good character.
Now fast-forward to the 20th century, and

56
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,500
we, at least in the West, have acquired a
very different set of beliefs and attitudes

57
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:36,020
towards decision-making: It's all about consequences.
Decisiveness now gets wrapped up in the economic

58
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,470
language of maximizing immediate outcomes
and gains.

59
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:47,710
So indecision is to miss out on opportunities
and advantages. Hesitation is expensive. And

60
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,460
it's not just letting yourself down, but also
letting down society by not being productive

61
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,110
and efficient.
What about indecision or indecisiveness as

62
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,599
a clinical pathology, as mental distress or
even a psychological disorder?

63
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:08,389
That's a really interesting question. In contrast
to the mild moral panic about indecision in

64
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:13,569
terms of goals and outcomes, there's a much
more cautious approach taken in clinical psychology

65
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:18,979
and psychiatry.
Even in the DSM, the manual of mental disorders,

66
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:23,919
indecisiveness is only listed as one non-essential
symptom for a very small number of disorders,

67
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,810
such as depression. It's not considered to
be a disorder in itself. It never has, and

68
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,449
it shouldn't be.
On the other hand, there's almost no attention

69
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:38,629
given to the psychological treatment of debilitating
indecision. We could do better at helping

70
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:45,199
people who struggle with decisions and whose
lives and wellbeing suffer as a result.

71
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,410
When might indecision be a good thing?
If we contrast indecision with its behavioural

72
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:56,090
opposite, impulsive decision making or hyper-decisiveness,
then we get a sense that indecision might

73
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,120
not always be a bad thing.
The root of the word "decision" is the Latin

74
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,539
verb "to cut off". Deciding means closing
off possibilities just as it's about gains

75
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,930
and outcomes. Sometimes we want to keep options
open for a while.

76
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,509
Artists, writers and musicians, for instance,
often tease apart what are otherwise simple

77
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,379
or mindless choices. And by holding these
choices open, they can turn what's there into

78
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:27,379
something unexpected and beautiful. Creativity
involves diving into the uncertainty of alternatives

79
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,500
and not letting them get cut off by decisions.
And would we really want to live in a world

80
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,069
where everything had to be decided immediately
and without room for mistake, experience or

81
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,389
revision? Think about what this would mean
in terms of finding a life partner, or choosing

82
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:48,800
a career-- or a hairstyle.
You suggest that there are two different approaches

83
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,889
to understanding indecision:
First, focusing on the possible outcomes and

84
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,599
consequences of the decision;
And second, focusing on the decision maker

85
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,479
How are these approaches distinct from one
another?

86
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,970
If we look at a decision in terms of outcomes
and consequences, then we can find indecision

87
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:13,650
in the difficulty and effort that's needed
to evaluate, compare and anticipate the available

88
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,710
alternatives. Indecision is the struggle to
reach the best decision; it's an informational

89
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,949
problem to be solved. Think about the process
of buying a new car. Comparing the features:

90
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,650
fuel economy and safety and the oomph of the
sound system and, of course, price; this can

91
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,140
be tough. Or it could be emotional and aesthetic
predictions, picturing yourself driving this

92
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,360
car versus another car for the next few years.
Which would make you happier?

93
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,140
But either way, it's about the possible outcomes
of your choice. If there are lots of very

94
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,870
similar cars to choose between, you're more
likely to experience indecision. This is the

95
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,940
so called "too much choice" effect. But it's
also about how you go about handling complexity

96
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,940
and information: are you a perfectionist?
Or will you settle for a "good enough" choice?

97
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,660
And what's the alternative view of indecision?
Alternatively, we can look at deciding as

98
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,649
a psychological event. We step in and out
of decisions all the time, but sometimes more

99
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:24,079
than others we put on the hat of a decision-maker
and are particularly aware of choosing. Sometimes

100
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,540
just being the decision-maker is stressful.
It's one thing to be calmly evaluating two

101
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,060
conflicting alternatives (say the choice between
an affordable, ugly car and one which is better

102
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,760
looking but less affordable). It's another
thing altogether to feel conflicted.

103
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,910
When this happens, indecision may be no longer
be about getting the best outcome, but just

104
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,100
getting through this particular decision.
Have you ever been in a restaurant where you're

105
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,940
experiencing significant indecision just looking
at the menu? There's a point where you no

106
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,339
longer care how good the food will taste:
the outcomes don't matter; you just want to

107
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:08,709
choose something, anything, and get the choice
over and done with.

108
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:13,810
And finally, there's a social dimension to
this. We may doubt our ability to choose.

109
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,110
We might worry about what other people will
think. If we're already a little bit indecisive,

110
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,850
we probably don't want to look even more indecisive,
but our efforts to look decisive can backfire

111
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,440
by occupying the cognitive resources needed
to make a good choice.

112
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,610
Decision avoidance versus decision delay:
are these two different kinds of indecision?

113
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,060
Delay could be thought of as one kind of avoidance.
There are lots of overlaps, but it helps to

114
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,910
think about what's actually being delayed
or avoided.

115
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,050
Decision avoidance can mean avoiding the act
of deciding entirely. This could be because

116
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,720
you don't actually want to decide at all,
or maybe because you feel that you don't know

117
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,089
how to decide. Decisions are confronting,
so you try not to engage at all and dodge

118
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,190
it in advance.
With delay, you're already within a decision

119
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,980
situation. You've already engaged with the
content and alternatives. Maybe you just need

120
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,160
more time to think through the complex information.
Or perhaps you're resentful or fearful at

121
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,990
having to be the decision-maker, which only
adds to the delay as you manage both the conflict

122
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,870
and the feeling of being conflicted.
Another possibility is that you've just depleted

123
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,320
your decision-making capacity. There's good
evidence that our ability to decide is like

124
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,470
a muscle. It can be temporarily worn out after
making repeated choices or by having too many

125
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,680
other demands on our limited brain power.
This "decision fatigue", as it's known, can

126
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,639
occur without us knowing, and can show up
as delay or bad choices.

127
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,170
What do you think are the key things missing
from mainstream theories about indecision?

128
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,300
The person. With indecision we're not dealing
with computers or algorithms but a person

129
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,550
at different levels: not only as an imperfect
processor of information, but also as having

130
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,300
past experiences and immediate emotions and
different identities.

131
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,610
I think we also need to better understand
the social and normative influences on decision-making.

132
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,889
What are our beliefs and values about decisiveness
and indecisiveness? We also shouldn't assume

133
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:26,649
that all cultures have the same attitudes
and norms about decision-making that we have

134
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,639
in the West.
Finally, what have you learned about your

135
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,730
own indecisiveness through your research?
I've learned to appreciate indecision, and

136
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:42,730
my own indecisiveness, a lot more. I've come
to recognise that it's not always bad. I think

137
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,779
I've become more inquisitive and relaxed about
it.

138
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:52,740
It's been nice to research a topic which seems
to resonate with people. Most people feel

139
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,070
that they're worse decision-makers than they
actually are. People seem to want to admit

140
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,670
that they're indecisive, partly to relieve
this social pressure of having to appear decisive,

141
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,459
and partly to be freed from the burden of
being decision-makers.

142
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,600
One thing that my research has shown is that
overvaluing decisiveness and being fearful

143
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,260
of indecisiveness only makes deciding more
difficult. And it makes people more likely

144
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,519
to choose for the wrong reasons. So as a start,
I think we can choose to think about decisions

145
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,189
and indecision better.
