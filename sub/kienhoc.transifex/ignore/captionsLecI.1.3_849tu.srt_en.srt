Robert Frost, the poet, once claimed that
metaphor is all there is to thinking. He said

2
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:36,300
it may not seem far for the mind to go, but
it is the mind's furthest. The metaphors we

3
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:43,579
use for ignorance, states of unknowing, ambiguity,
vagueness, all of those sorts of things, are

4
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,769
interesting because almost all of them are
negative in various ways.

5
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:55,089
It's as if we have a cultural or social agreement
that the unknown is a bad thing. It's something

6
00:00:55,089 --> 00:01:00,650
to be got rid of, either by overcoming it
by finding out new things, regulating it out

7
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:07,650
of existence, or even simply banishing it or denying
that it exists. I think this reflects a kind

8
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,009
of blind spot, at least in Western intellectual
culture anyway, because, as we'll see, we

9
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:21,500
actually have uses for ignorance and the unknowns.
In fact, we need them.

10
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:28,500
There are several kinds of metaphors for ignorance.
We can think of ignorance in terms of our

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,490
senses: Sight, feeling, smell, taste, and
sound.

12
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:43,490
When we're ignorant, we're blind. To know
is to see.

13
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,940
Ignorance leaves us in the dark.
Vague ideas are foggy, blurry, murky, unclear,

14
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,640
obscured.
Ideas can be felt. Incomplete ideas are rough.

15
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:11,580
Complete or finished ideas are polished, and
smooth.

16
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,670
We can think of ignorance in terms of navigating,
or gathering and hunting.

17
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:26,590
Learning and discovery are journeys. To know
or discover something, to learn it, is to

18
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:33,590
start on a path and eventually reach a destination,
knowledge.

19
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,650
Prior information may illuminate our path,
whereas ignorance obscures it.

20
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,780
Sought-after knowledge is forage and prey.
It can be grasped, or captured and trapped.

21
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,890
But truth is elusive. It may slip from our
grasp, or escape our notice, and not be found.

22
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Truths can be targeted and they can be homed
in on. Errors or bad ideas, on the other hand,

23
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:30,020
are off-target, or wide of the mark.
Ignorance and knowledge have their own geography.

24
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,310
One popular metaphor for the border between
the known and unknown is that it is a wild frontier.

25
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:50,090
Ignorance is unconquered territory. Learning
and discovery push back the frontier, conquer

26
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,470
regions, diminishing the domain of ignorance.
Ultimately, ignorance is entirely conquered

27
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:02,470
by new knowledge or information.
But another popular alternative metaphor is

28
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:09,819
that the unknown is an ocean. And knowledge
is an island inside this ocean of ignorance.

29
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:17,370
The larger the island, the more we know, then
too the larger the border between what we

30
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,370
know and what we don't know, which remains
an ocean.

31
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,680
We can think of ignorance as being holes,
or gaps, in our knowledge. These holes define

32
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,430
what we don't know in the structure of this
knowledge.

33
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:48,430
Ignorance can be thought of in monetary terms.
Ideas and knowledge are resources. In fact,

34
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,930
oftentimes they are thought of and bought
and sold as currency. We speak of a "wealth

35
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,930
of knowledge". But bad ideas and ignorance
are worthless, bankrupt. Ignorance is poverty

36
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:13,610
and want.
Well, I think you get the idea. If you do

37
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:21,930
the reading, you'll find that there are other
sources of metaphors for ignorance: Sources

38
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,960
and topics such as power, tyranny, inequality,
sex and procreation, feelings. All of that

39
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,220
provides grist for the mill, and you'll find
that almost all of the metaphors there are

40
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,720
also negative.
So where can we find positive metaphors for

41
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,960
the unknown? Hang on a second: I'll give you
a clue.

42
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Well, I promised you a clue, and here it is.
You can see me out there, chattering away.

43
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Now, before this, when you saw me I was in
my office. What's the difference? Well, out

44
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:09,570
there, I'm ... more ... free! Exactly.
Freedom is a positively badged word for the

45
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,979
unknown. And what I'm doing out there is demonstrating
that I'm freer to move around, freer to talk,

46
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:20,070
to gesture, all that sort of thing.
And if you haven't got any unknowns in your

47
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,530
life, if everything is fore-ordained, laid
out for you: Then you have no options, you

48
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:31,530
have no choices, and you have no freedom.
Once we have a positive word, like "freedom",

49
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,370
for ignorance, then it's not too hard to think
of positive metaphors. Freedom, after all,

50
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,370
is the open air, the sky, flying. We speak
of being "as free as a bird".

51
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,300
And we can be as free as a bird and revel
in the unknown in life's mysteries and its

52
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:02,300
surprises. Freedom is broad horizons, it's room to move. Freedom of space.
Ignorance and the unknowns give us room to

53
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:12,810
move, they give us broad horizons. And they're
also unfettered, unshackled, just as freedom

54
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:19,030
is. They can unfetter us and unshackle us from
routine and convention, and enable us to see

55
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:24,300
the world in new ways.
The main purpose of this lecture has been

56
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,520
to illustrate how negative most of our thinking
about ignorance is, and to demonstrate that

57
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,380
by using some common metaphors. But it has
also been to introduce you to a theme of this

58
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:43,009
course, which is that ignorance has benefits
and uses that we need to be aware of, and

59
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,360
that we can use to our advantage.
