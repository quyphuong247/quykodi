Most of the time, most of us are convinced
that we know far more than we actually do,

2
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:35,920
even according to our own commonsense ideas
of what real knowledge is. Let me hasten to

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,530
say Gabriele and I both do this too. But if
we're going to understand anything about ignorance,

4
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,850
getting a good grip on our own ignorance is
a good place to start. We're not just referring

5
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,600
to things that we think we know that turn
out to be wrong. In fact, let's start with

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,600
what we know that is true. Something simple,
like the Earth is not flat. I've asked classrooms

7
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,119
of students how many of them know the Earth
is round. Almost all hands go up. Then I ask

8
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,270
how many of them could prove it, or offer
a reasonable argument in its favor that would

9
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:17,110
pass even a mild skeptic's scrutiny. Almost
all hands go down. Well like us, most of them

10
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,530
will have received that message from sources
they trust. Indeed most of what we think we

11
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,460
know is what we've read or heard from someone
who in turn was told it by someone else, and

12
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,000
so on. So, the vast majority of what we usually
consider "knowledge" isn't even second-hand.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,829
It really is third-hand and far removed from
our direct experience. There's a difference,

14
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:45,810
then, between what we know from first-hand
experience and asserting a belief that we've

15
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,860
absorbed third-hand and being able to back
it up with supporting evidence or arguments.

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:57,600
A great deal of what we think we know is "socially
constructed" in the sense of being told to

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,180
us by parents, schools, the media, and so
on. This isn't only the case with rumors or

18
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,200
myths. It's true of a lot of things we take
as good common sense. So, let's look at why

19
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,900
we know a lot less than we think we do. There
are five good reasons for this. First, finding

20
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,340
out everything for ourselves is simply impossible.
We don't have enough time, brain power, and

21
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,340
access to other resources to do this. In addition,
making first-hand discoveries involves risks.

22
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,620
It's much safer to learn what's poisonous
vicariously than to find out for yourself.

23
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,980
And some kinds of inquiry also carry social
risks, because they might violate cultural

24
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,900
taboos or offend important people. Most of
us would not really know whether a professor

25
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,530
or a boss has the qualifications they claim,
but asking to see their degrees or certificates

26
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,540
could be quite risky. A second reason why
we know a lot less than we think we do is

27
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,569
that we have a propensity to fill in the blanks.
We do that both in recalling past events and

28
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:09,569
in interpreting current ones. Imagine this
scenario: A friend gestures to a bowl of food

29
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,549
he's eating and says, "This stuff is hot."
If we're at a table in an Indian restaurant

30
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:20,519
eating curries, I'll fill in the blank by
inferring that he means chilli-hot or spicy.

31
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,810
On the other hand if we're in a Russian restaurant
devouring piroshki, I'll infer that he means

32
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,110
high temperature. In either situation I'll
think I know what my friend means but, strictly

33
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,580
speaking, I don't. A huge amount of what we
think of as understanding in communication

34
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,580
of nearly every kind relies on inferences
and interpretations of this kind. Interestingly,

35
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,810
memory is similarly reconstructive. We only
have fragments of genuine recollections and

36
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,489
we fill in the blanks to generate an account
that sounds plausible and coherent. Hindsight

37
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:03,120
bias is a related problem and a third reason
why we think we know more than we do. Hindsight

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,920
bias is the tendency to over-estimate the
extent to which we "knew it all along" when

39
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,099
a prediction comes true. This has been studied
a lot in psychology. The typical psychological

40
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,320
experiment demonstrating hindsight bias asks
people to make a prediction about an event

41
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,840
and then later to recall how confident they
were in their prediction. When the event that

42
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,940
people predicted occurred, their recollection
is that they were much more confident in their

43
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,250
prediction than when the event they predicted
did not occur. In the readings for this week

44
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,080
you'll find an accessible article by Paul
Goodwin, where he points out that an additional

45
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,949
downside to hindsight bias is that it can
make us over-confident about our predictive

46
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:55,270
abilities. This brings us to the fourth reason,
which is that we all suffer from a tendency

47
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,310
to be over-confident about our estimations
and predictions. If we're asked to give a

48
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,900
lower and upper estimate of a quantity we
don't know, such as the weight of a Boeing

49
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,990
767 airliner, and we're instructed to give
lower and upper estimates that we're 90% confident

50
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,370
will contain the correct answer, the chance
of our estimates containing the true answer

51
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:23,370
turns out to be around 40-50%. In other words,
our intervals are consistently too narrow.

52
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,229
Oddly, we tend to be over-confident in domains
that we know the least about or where it's

53
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:35,970
harder to make an estimation. Having said
that though, experts don't escape over-confidence

54
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:42,970
even when making estimates in their area of
expertise. Just as with the Boeing 767 example,

55
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,190
when business managers were asked to give
upper and lower limits which they thought

56
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,940
had a 90% chance of estimating quantities
that were within the limits of their expertise

57
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,889
such as predicted profits in their own business
lines, their intervals contained the correct

58
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,889
values only 38 to 58% of the time instead
of 90% of the time. Fifth and finally, perhaps

59
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,380
the most unsettling domain where we mislead
ourselves about how much we know is the workings

60
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:19,229
of our own minds. Introspection has a chequered
history in psychology and a majority of cognitive

61
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:25,110
psychologists these days would hold it to
be an invalid and unreliable source of data

62
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,000
on mental processes. The classic paper in
this vein is Richard Nisbett's and Timothy

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,340
Wilson's 1977 work, in which they concluded
that people are unable to accurately report

64
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:43,789
their mental processes or whether a mental
process has occurred. Now, Wilson and Nisbett

65
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:49,830
realized that there are powerful motivations
for our unawareness of our unawareness. They

66
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,800
pointed out that it's natural to prefer to
believe we have access to our own thoughts.

67
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,630
It's frightening to think that we don't know
the workings of our own minds any better than

68
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,479
an outsider who knows us reasonably well.
We've just seen that in several ways we're

69
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,740
more ignorant than we like to think we are.
But so what? First, because we have to rely

70
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,879
on so much knowledge that's not based on our
own experience, it is harder for us to recognise

71
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:25,220
when knowledge has changed. At one time, everyone
"knew" the world was flat, or that the sun

72
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,330
revolved around the Earth. And it took a long
time for that "knowledge" to change. Another

73
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,069
consequence of relying on knowledge from others
is that we're vulnerable to being hoodwinked

74
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:43,000
by persuasive communicators. It turns out
that we give the same weight to what some

75
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,979
authority or majority says as we do to our
own experience, sometimes even greater weight.

76
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,039
Third our propensity to fill in the blanks
often leads to miscommunication. I'm sure

77
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,139
you can find examples of this from your own
experience. Finally, if we're unaware of various

78
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,539
biases in our thinking we end up falling prey
to them. Again I'm sure we can all think of

79
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:13,539
examples of hindsight bias and over-confidence
in our estimates and predictions. Nevertheless,

80
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,550
this isn't cause for gloom. After all, most
of us navigate our way through life in this

81
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,190
world quite well. In this course we'll explore
what ignorance is like, how it gets created

82
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:34,190
and destroyed, when and where ignorance is
bliss, and what we do with our own and others'

83
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:40,000
ignorance. Along the way, we'll examine the
links ignorance has with decision making,

84
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,490
social interaction, and even social institutions
and the economy. We'll find out about when

85
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,290
ignorance can be good or bad for us. We'll
also see that ignorance is deceptively difficult

86
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:58,579
to pin down. It's a complex and slippery concept
with a lot of pitfalls for the unwary. We'll

87
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:04,089
get a taste of that complexity in the next
lecture, where we examine the various metaphors

88
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,190
we use for the unknown.
